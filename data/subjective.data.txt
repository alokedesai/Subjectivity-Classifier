A large majority of Americans say they like the insurance coverage they obtained through government exchanges , which were set up by the Affordable Care Act .Via PoliticoWith the second round of Obamacare enrollment set to begin on Saturday , 71 percent said their coverage through the exchanges was good or excellent , according to a Gallup poll released Friday . Another 19 percent said the coverage was fair , while 9 percent rated it poorly .The pollster notes that these marks are comparable to all who have health insurance . However , those newly insured through the exchanges are more satisfied with the cost of health care — with 75 percent saying so — versus 61 percent of all insured respondents who said they were satisfied with the cost of health care .
Ezra Klein directs us to the latest from the Kaiser Family Foundation , which asks what the average Obamacare 2015 premium increase will be for those places for which we have full information — and finds that premiums will actually decline slightly . Ezra tries to get us to appreciate just how good the Obamacare news has been with a thought experiment:Imagine taking a time machine back to 2010 and telling Republicans in Congress , who were arguing that the CBO was wildly underestimating Obamacare’s cost , that the law would be cheaper than predicted and , at least in the states that accepted its Medicaid dollars , cover more people than the Congressional Budget Office thought . After the laughing and mocking and the calling of security , let’s say you offered this prediction in the form a of a bet . What odds do you think Obamacare’s critics would have offered ? 2:1 ? 5:1 ? 10:1 ?But you don’t have to go back to 2010 . Look at John Cochrane in late 2013 , taking it for granted that Obamacare would implode in a death spiral within a few months . Look at The Hill just four months ago , telling us that double-digit premium hikes were coming .One question we might ask here is , why is the news so good ? The answer , I’d suggest — although I hope the real experts will weigh in — is that we’re actually seeing the opposite of a death spiral ; call it a life spiral . For one thing , the huge surge in enrollments late in the day meant that the risk pool this year is better than insurers expected , and they now expect 2015 to be better still . Also , importantly , big enrollments mean that more insurers are entering the market , increasing competition . And , of course , the better the deal the more people will sign up : success feeds success .Another question we might ask : Is our conservatives learning ? Are those who bought into the death spiral stories , who seized on every hint of bad news , asking themselves how they got it so wrong ? Are they , maybe , considering the possibility that they’re listening to the wrong people , that maybe Jon Gruber knows what he’s talking about and John Goodman is a hack ?Hahahaha .
SO far , opponents of the Affordable Care Act have lost every major battle to repeal or invalidate it . Some of them are now urging the courts to interpret the health reform law in a way that would guarantee its failure . This is a significant threat — potentially as grave as the previous main legal challenge to the law , which the Supreme Court rejected , 5 to 4 , in 2012 . If the new effort succeeds , it would create total chaos .Having failed to undo the individual mandate to buy health insurance , opponents now claim that , under the law , subsidies for low- and moderate-income Americans to buy insurance may be paid only in those states — currently 14 — that have set up their own online insurance exchanges . This would torpedo a central goal of the law : the expansion of coverage .At first , those of us who support Obamacare thought these claims were a joke . On July 22 , the federal appellate court in Richmond , Va. , rejected one such claim , but the same day , astonishingly , the federal appellate court for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled , 2 to 1 , in favor of the plaintiff in a similar case , Halbig v. Burwell . Similar challenges are working their way through courts in two other circuits .Last Thursday , the entire United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit put aside that 2-1 ruling , agreeing to hear the case “en banc” on Dec. 17 . But now the opponents of Obamacare are asking the Supreme Court to immediately hear an appeal of the Richmond decision , and to pre-empt the full District of Columbia court from hearing the case .The legal challenges say that a provision in the law that references the payment of credits to people who enroll through “an Exchange” that is “established by a State” means that credits are not available in the 36 states that have decided to have the federal government manage their exchanges for them .We are economists , not lawyers . But we note that the statute , while vague at points , confirms , when read in its entirety , that tax credits are to be available on all the exchanges , nationwide . The law specifically instructed the secretary of health and human services to create and manage the exchanges for states that chose that option . And when the law was passed , everyone involved in the law’s passage understood that this directive vested federal exchanges with the same mission and authority as state-mandated exchanges .The expansion of coverage rests on interlocking elements . The law bars insurers from denying coverage to people with pre-existing medical conditions , dropping coverage when people develop costly illnesses , and charging discriminatory premiums . By themselves , these provisions would encourage people to delay buying insurance until they became ill , causing premiums to skyrocket . So to keep premiums affordable , the law requires nearly everyone to buy insurance , and offers low- and moderate-income people financial help — in the form of refundable tax credits . If both the sick and the healthy buy insurance , premiums can be kept within reason .Limiting tax credits to the 14 states that manage their own exchanges ( along with the District of Columbia ) would destroy this careful architecture . Over five million people receive coverage through federal exchanges — two-thirds of all those covered through exchanges and 40 percent of those newly insured by the act . The best estimates suggest that out-of-pocket costs to typical enrollees of the least-expensive plans available in federally facilitated exchanges would soar to 23 percent of household income , from 3 percent — and to 28 percent of income , from 6 percent , for those in the second least-expensive plans . Households would lose about $ 36 billion in tax credits that help make insurance affordable . Some 6.5 million fewer people would be insured . The federal exchanges could collapse , because they would be left with sick patients , saddled with costly premiums .The record is unambiguous : Congress , in 2010 , understood and endorsed the links connecting the sale of insurance , the requirement to carry insurance and the financial aid to make it affordable . Opponents who lost in the democratic process are now seeking to vitiate the law through a perverse reading of it .If the full District of Columbia Circuit takes up the case , it should reject this sophistry . Meanwhile , the Supreme Court should wait to see what the lower courts do before deciding whether to intervene . Whatever one thinks of the Affordable Care Act , it is absurd to argue that its drafters intended to make insurance unaffordable .
On Thursday morning , as almost everyone predicted it would , the federal appeals court in Washington , D.C. , voted to toss out a three-judge panel’s ruling upholding the latest attempt to kill “Obamacare.” The full 11-member court is scheduled to rehear the case on Dec. 17 .The claim this time was that subsidies for the health exchanges that are at the heart of the law are available only to those exchanges “established by the State.” In other words , not available in the three dozen states where the federal government has set up an exchange because the state refused to . This would result in the denial of coverage to an estimated 4.7 million Americans . To succeed , the claim required that those four words be considered in a hermetically sealed tube , independent from the rest of the 900-page law , whose core purpose was to ensure affordable health-care to lower-income Americans .Luckily for the challengers , two of the three panel judges in the case , Halbig v. Burwell , were sympathetic to that way of reading the law . The third was less impressed , calling it a “not-so-veiled attempt to gut” the Affordable Care Act .The rehearing will occur before a court with a majority of judges appointed by Democratic presidents . For that reason , many predict that the court will side with the government and reject the challengers’ claim .This matters because the challengers desperately wanted to pole-vault over the D.C. appeals court and go straight to the Supreme Court — where they believe they have their best shot at winning once and for all . It’s the high-stakes version of what lawyers call “forum-shopping” — each side maneuvering to get a case into the court where they feel their chances are best .While it’s generally wise to avoid gaming out judges’ votes based simply on the party of their appointing president , in the Halbig case , that has been a reliable proxy .Of course , a key reason for the current makeup of the D.C. appeals court is the Senate’s reform of the filibuster process last fall , which was triggered by Republicans’ refusal to allow a vote on any of President Obama’s three nominees to that court . After the reform , all three nominees were confirmed .If anyone was wondering what the hue and cry over filibuster reform was really about in practice , the Halbig case is Exhibit A .
It looks as though Republicans are no longer betting on the Affordable Care Act as a surefire political weapon . The Upshot reported on Wednesday that , in the summer of 2013 , lawmakers churned out 530 news releases using the term “Obamacare.” So far this summer , in advance of the mid-terms when one might expect that number to go up , it’s fallen dramatically , to 138 so far .In addition to this sign of waning interest , Bloomberg reported last Tuesday that Republicans in competitive Senate races “are easing off their strategy of criticizing Democrats over the Affordable Care Act.” Here’s the situation in North Carolina , according to Bloomberg , where Democratic Senator Kay Hagan is in a statistical tie with her Republican challenger , Thom Tillis:In April , anti-Obamacare advertising dwarfed all other spots in North Carolina . It accounted for 3,061 , or 54 percent , of the 5,704 top five issue ads in North Carolina , according to Kantar Media’s Campaign Media Analysis Group . By July , the numbers had reversed , with anti-Obamacare ads accounting for 971 , or 27 percent , of the top issue ads , and the budget , government spending , jobs and unemployment accounting for 2,608 , or 72 percent , of such ads , CMAG data show .Republicans of course haven’t embraced the Affordable Care Act . Now that it’s actually gone into effect , though , they seem to be slowly coming around the reality that it’s not at all the disaster they assumed it would be , and therefore may not draw voters to the polls .
In my post yesterday on potential metrics for assessing Obamacare’s claim to be a policy success , I didn’t directly address the law’s eventual impact on the deficit . So I’m grateful to Jonathan Chait for raising the issue , in the course of a post explaining why the Obamacare debate proves ( yet again , he would say ) that liberals are more empirical and data-driven than conservatives . Noting that many Republicans had alleged that the law’s promise of deficit reduction was based ( in Paul Ryan’s words ) on “gimmicks and smoke and mirrors , ” Chait cites a new C.B.O . estimate on the cost of the law’s coverage expansion and announces that reality has spoken , and the case is closed:There will never be a single dramatic moment that will shatter the right’s inbred health-care falsehoods the way the election , in a single night , discredited the poll-unskewers . But the Congressional Budget Office’s update on Obamacare issued last week is the latest and most powerful repudiation of the case Ryan and his allies made . It reiterates that , contrary to the right’s certainty that the apparent deficit-reducing measures would melt away as the program went online , it still reduces the deficit . Indeed , it turns out to be even more fiscally conservative than originally forecast . Every new forecast turns out to be more optimistic than the last .In fact , this is not exactly what the update says : It’s focused exclusively on the cost of the coverage expansion , which means that it doesn’t address the offsets ( sharp cuts to Medicare , in particular ) that Republicans had in mind when they accused the White House of relying on promises of future belt-tightening that will never actually be imposed . The update does reference a two-year-old projection which found that these offsets , if duly enacted , would reduce the deficit , but then it pleads agnosticism as to the current situation , writing that “CBO … can no longer determine exactly how the provisions of the ACA that are not related to the expansion of health insurance coverage have affected their projections of direct spending and revenues … isolating the incremental effects of those provisions on previously existing programs and revenues four years after enactment of the ACA is not possible.”So the report doesn’t tell us anything , and doesn’t claim to tell us anything , about whether all the promised Medicare cuts are actually happening ( spoiler : they aren’t ) , let alone whether they or any other revenue-raising provisions ( the Cadillac tax on high-value plans , the employer mandate ) are likely to be fully implemented in the future , or whether already-implemented and unpopular measures like the medical device tax could end up being repealed , or … well , you get the idea . Which means that by definition , the update isn’t proof that the law is “even more fiscally conservative than originally forecast , ” because that simply isn’t a question it sets out to answer .This doesn’t mean , though , that we can’t make an educated guess about the fiscal picture , and mine is that what’s happened to date is mostly a wash : The projected cost of coverage has gone down , as Chait says , mostly because health care inflation has been well below expectations and because Obamacare is covering fewer people than originally hoped , and the Obama White House has used those savings as a reason to postpone some unpleasant-to-implement provisions — delaying Medicare Advantage cuts , weakening IPAB’s mandate , delaying the employer mandate , etc .This interconnectedness of coverage , cost inflation and deficits is part why I didn’t include the deficit in my prior list of standards for success … because it’s entangled , in different ways , with the standards I did list . If enrollment ends up well below expectations , for instance , the fiscal cost of the program will be much more manageable — but it’s not clear , given the law’s coverage-expanding objectives , that this would actually count as true good news . Alternatively , if cost inflation stays low , then the fiscal issues will likewise diminish in a way that’s much more uncomplicatedly positive . But then in a scenario where inflation picks up again and enrollment heads back toward the levels that the law’s architects expected , the problem of actually cutting Medicare will loom larger , and the promised-but-postponed offsets will have to actually be pursued . At which point we’ll actually find out if the G.O.P . was right to dismiss them all as smoke and mirrors — but until then , the question is still open .The deeper debate here , though , is one that can’t necessarily be decisively adjudicated by even the most data-driven umpire , for reasons suggested by the C.B.O.’s point about the difficulty of “isolating” the effect of Obamacare on existing policies and programs . Here I mean that it’s entirely possible that the new health care law will end up being technically revenue neutral while also having a sweepingly negative impact on America’s fiscal picture overall — because its mix of cuts and tax hikes , if fully enacted , could drastically limit future policymakers’ options when the time comes to make further cuts or raise taxes to pay for Medicare and Social Security . ( This is part of what conservatives mean when they accuse the Obama White House of “double counting” and “gimmickry” and the like — they’re saying that if you make cuts to an insolvent-in-the-long-run program to pay for a new program , you’re engaged in something other than “fiscal conservatism , ” because you haven’t actually addressed your original insolvency problem . )Again , maybe — hopefully — a permanent slowdown in health care costs makes a lot of this problem go away . But it’s quite possible that we’ll end up , 10 or 15 years from now , with liberals declaring that Obamacare has been deficit-neutral and conservatives declaring that it’s created big fiscal problems , and with both sides having a reasonable ( and , yes , empirical ) point .
No , I haven’t lost my mind — or suddenly become an Ayn Rand disciple . It’s not my ideal ; in a better world I’d call for single-payer , and a significant role for the government in directly providing care .But Ross Douthat , in the course of realistically warning his fellow conservatives that Obamacare doesn’t seem to be collapsing , goes on to tell them that they’re going to have to come up with a serious alternative .But Obamacare IS the conservative alternative , and not just because it was originally devised at the Heritage Foundation . It’s what a health-care system that does what even conservatives say they want , like making sure that people with preexisting conditions can get coverage , has to look like if it isn’t single-payer .I don’t really think one more repetition of the logic will convince many people , but here we go again . Suppose you want preexisting conditions covered . Then you have to impose community rating — insurers must offer the same policies to people regardless of medical history . But just doing that causes a death spiral , because people wait until they’re sick to buy insurance . So you also have to have a mandate , requiring healthy people to join the risk pool . And to make buying insurance possible for people with lower incomes , you have to have subsidies .And what you’ve just defined are the essentials of ObamaRomneyCare . It’s a three-legged stool that needs all three legs . If you want to cover preexisting conditions , you must have the mandate ; if you want the mandate , you must have subsidies . If you think there’s some magic market-based solution that obviates the stuff conservatives don’t like while preserving the stuff they like , you’re deluding yourself .What this means in practice is that any notion that Republicans will go beyond trying to sabotage the law and come up with an alternative is fantasy . Again , Obamacare is the conservative alternative , and you can’t move further right without doing no reform at all .
So Chris Christie says that Obamacare is “a failure on a number of levels” . Which levels , exactly ?I mean , first-year enrollment is above projections . The number of Americans without insurance has dropped sharply . Costs appear to be lower than expected , and more broadly cost control on health seems to be doing remarkably well:To some extent I suspect that Christie is living in the bubble ; I keep remembering how Rand Paul was shocked and disbelieving at the proposition that government employment had fallen under Obama , even though all it takes to know that is a quick look at public data .But it’s not just misinformation ; the reality doesn’t matter for Christie , or Republicans in general . Just as tax cuts can never fail , programs that help the unlucky can never succeed .
One of the odd rituals of American punditry — the most famous example is Karl Rove’s tantrum in 2012 , but it happens all the time — is the way pundits and operatives keep spinning after the polls have closed . Never mind the vote totals , and let’s dispute the network projections ; my guy is still winning !The obvious question is , what’s the point ? The votes are already in ; you can’t build momentum , or attract more donations , or any of those other things that claims of imminent victory might do . Wouldn’t election night be a good time to adopt the persona of hard-headed realist , not delusional wishful thinker ? Yet this hardly ever happens .Something like this is going on with Obamacare . Not a day goes by without some prominent Republican politician or pundit insisting that the enrollment numbers are phony , that more people are losing insurance than gaining it , etc.. I know that’s what the base believes , because it’s what they hear from Rush and Fox . But you would think that important people would have someone around who has a clue , who knows that enrollment data and multiple surveys are all telling the same story of unexpected success . OK , maybe not — if famous senators don’t have anyone to clue them in about BLS data , they might really still be living in the bubble . But that’s really their choice .And the point is that with enrollment more or less closed for 2014 , there’s not much point in spinning . OK , maybe if you can keep up the pretense all the way to November , you can slightly sway base voters for the midterms . But even that’s doubtful — by the fall , we’re going to have a very clear picture of how things went ; and the shape of that picture has already been determined .I guess that what gets me is the — to use the technical term — wussiness of it all . Isn’t there any space on the right for people who sell themselves as tough-minded , who condemn Obamacare on principle but warn their followers that it’s not on the verge of collapse ? Is the whole party so insecure , so unable to handle the truth , that it automatically shoots anyone bearing bad news ?And the answer appears to be yes .
Just a quick note in support of government statisticians . They do an incredibly important job , and by and large do it very well . They’ve also maintained a well-deserved reputation for staying out of the political fray , of acting as civil servants , not party apparatchiks .You can argue that the Census decision to change its health-insurance questionnaire starting with the 2013 data wasn’t such a good idea — in fact , I know a number of health care experts who are dismayed . But it’s really quite vile to have talk-show hosts who quite literally know nothing about the field , other than that they’re against covering the uninsured , casually accusing Census of “cooking the books” to support Obamacare .But remember , MSNBC is the liberal network , right ? Why don’t they just hire Donald Trump and be done with it ?
If you’ve been tracking the news on signups under the Affordable Care Act – which is easy thanks to Charles Gaba’s invaluable site – you already knew that the program was making a pretty good recovery from the botched start . Now , however , it’s official : as of the end of January signups were only about a million behind their projected track as of last spring , which means that as of March 31 the total is likely to be 6-point-something million rather than the projected 7 million . In other words , basically OK .But here’s the thing : every online article I’ve seen about the latest numbers is followed by a huge number of vitriolic comments insisting that it isn’t true , that Obamacare is a total disaster . Some commenters declare that all the numbers are lies ; others , getting their take from right-wing bloggers , say that all of those who have signed up but not yet paid their first premium – ahem , 47 percent of the total – will never pay and are fake enrollees . And so on .You can’t help but notice the resemblance to the “unskewing” fever of the final weeks of the 2012 election , when everyone on the right knew , just knew , that the polls showing a clear Obama edge were biased and wrong , and that if you reworked the numbers somehow they pointed to a Romney triumph .Now , you might ask , how do I know that the Obamacare unskewers are wrong ? Actually , I don’t know that for sure – but it’s very unlikely that they’re right . For one thing , they are more or less the same as the poll unskewers – people who know nothing about the subject , but know what they want to believe . For another , CBO – which has a reputation to defend – thinks it’s going to be OK . Finally , the insurers , who have real money on the line , seem fairly calm , which wouldn’t be the case if they saw really terrible enrollment .Two things are interesting about all of this . First , the right has evidently learned nothing from the unskewing debacle . And second , right-wingers are totally vested in the idea of an Obamacare collapse . They have no plan B , and their only answer to growing evidence that it’s not going to happen is furious denial .
Here and here and here .A sample:Well , I suppose some of the people who predicted doom will reconsider their views , and engage in some soul-searching about why they were so wrong — maybe even realize that they were letting their politics distort their analysis .You can stop laughing now .
The Commonwealth Fund has a new study out on Obamacare enrollment , estimating that about 9.5 million people gained coverage through Medicaid and the exchanges ; this is roughly in line with some previous estimates but perhaps slightly more encouraging for the law’s supporters . Jonathan Cohn uses the estimate to declare that the law is meeting expectations in covering the uninsured:… The Congressional Budget Office predicted that , one year into full implementation , Obamacare would reduce the the number of Americans without insurance by 12 million . That included the young adults who got insurance before 2014 , by signing onto their parents’ plans . There’s been some controversy over exactly how many more young people are insured because of that new option , but the best estimates I’ve seen place the number somewhere between 1 and 2.5 million . Add that number to the 9.5 million from the Commonwealth survey , and you’re close or equal to the CBO projections .Of course , the Commonwealth survey has a hefty margin of error and the CBO projections , revised to take account of the early technological problems on Obamacare websites , were never that scientific . But the figures seem to be in the same ballpark . That’s what matters .In broad strokes , this is plausible : Obamacare has stabilized , it’s insuring substantial numbers of people , the disaster scenarios have been averted and most people getting coverage seem reasonably happy with it . I would only offer the caveat that when Cohn says “in the same ballpark , ” he means “in the same ballpark , but probably lower than what was hoped for , which in turn was lower than what was originally projected.” That is , if the Commonwealth figure is right we’re probably looking at between 10 and 11 million newly-insured overall for 2014 ( I’m relying on “best estimates” for the number of young adults that are slightly lower than Cohn’s ) , which is lower than the 12 million the C.B.O . projected in April , which is lower than the 13 million it projected after the website problems , which is lower than the 14 million it projected after the Supreme Court decision on Medicaid , which is lower … you get the idea .All of which means that this new estimate , while useful , doesn’t really bring us any closer to knowing whether Obamacare enrollment will ultimately end up where its advocates hoped — making up ground lost during the disastrous roll-out over the next couple of years , and hitting 25-30 million newly insured by 2017 or so — or whether its current shortfalls will persist and it will end up many millions below that target .With that being said , there are other recent numbers — the surprising downward revisions on overall health care spending ( albeit revisions associated with a terrible first quarter for the economy ) , the continued downward trajectory of Medicare costs — that make it seem a little more likely that Obamacare will end up passing a different test on my recent “what count as success” list , by producing less in the way of health care cost inflation than its critics have expected . And if you throw in the suggestive data on health outcomes from the recent Massachusetts study , I think it’s entirely fair ( especially given where we were six months ago ! ) for the law’s supporters to put a glass-half-full spin on what we’re seeing at the moment — even if there’s still a long , long way to go .
Update : And exchange-based enrollments pass 6 million . Gaba now projects 6.5 million by 3/31 , and with the extensions it will go higher . The original CBO projection of 7 million now looks basically right , despite the website woes .Predictably , Republicans are in an uproar over the latest tweak to the Obamcare signups — an extension of the March 31 deadline for people who say that they tried to apply but encountered technical difficulty . As Jonathan Cohn says , the real objection here seems to be not so much that Obama is overstepping his bounds as that this will make it possible for more people to get insurance .But I also have the sense that people in the GOP are still working with a completely wrong narrative — namely , that Obamacare is failing , and that these are desperate ploys to save a sinking ship . The reality is quite different : enrollments have clearly surged in the final month . Charles Gaba is now projecting 6.4 million through the exchanges , and many more directly purchased from insurers .True , we don’t yet know how many signups were previously uninsured , and we don’t know the age/health mix of the people signing up . So we don’t know how well year one of the ACA really worked , and won’t for some time . The point , however , is that the system has evidently overcome most of its teething troubles .How will the GOP respond when the numbers come in ? If present behavior is any guide , they’ll spend months listening to “unskewers” claiming that nobody is actually going to pay for policies , or that there are untold millions who lost their insurance and can’t replace it , etc , etc.. There really isn’t any room in their worldview for the possibility that this thing might work .
Back when rate shock , website problems and lagging enrollment were threatening to unravel the new health care law before it fully took effect , I concluded a column on Obamacare’s repeated near-death experiences with the following warning to conservatives:The welfare state’s ability to defend itself against reform , however , carries a cautionary message for Obamacare’s critics as well . What isn’t killed outright grows stronger the longer it’s embedded in the federal apparatus , gaining constituents and interest-group support just by virtue of its existence even if it doesn’t work out the way it was designed . And as disastrous as its launch has been , if the health care law can survive this crisis in the same limping , staggering way it survived Scott Brown and the Supremes , then it will be a big step closer to being part of the status quo , with all the privileges and political strength that entails .So yes — it’s possible that this brush with death will be fatal , possible that the law will fall with the lightest , most politically painless push . But it’s still likely that Obamacare will be undone only if its critics are willing to do something more painful , and take their own turn wrestling with a system that resists any kind of change .With the latest numbers showing exchange enrollment climbing toward 7 million , I think we can safely retire that “possible , ” and change the “likely” to an “all-but-definite.” Not because rising enrollment proves that Obamacare is definitely working , in the sense that both its friends and critics would have originally understood the term . We don’t know yet what the paid enrollment looks like or how successfully the program is actually enrolling the uninsured . ( After some grim estimates , this Rand study is making liberals feel a little more optimistic , but still suggests a below-expectations result . ) We don’t know what the age-and-health-status composition of the enrollee pools looks like or what that means for premiums next year and beyond . We don’t know if any of the suspended/postponed provisions of the law will actually take effect . And we certainly don’t know what any of this means for social policy in the long run .But we do know that there won’t be an immediate political unraveling , and that we aren’t headed for the kind of extremely-low-enrollment scenario that seemed conceivable just a few months ago , or the possible world where cancellations had ended up outstripping enrollment , creating a net decline in the number of insured . And knowing that much has significant implications for our politics . It means that the kind of welfare-state embedding described above is taking place on a significant scale , that a large constituency will be served by Obamacare ( through Medicaid as well as the exchanges ) in 2016 and beyond , and that any kind of conservative alternative will have to confront the reality that the kind of tinkering-around-the-edges alternatives to Obamacare that many Republicans have supported to date would end up stripping coverage from millions of newly-insured Americans . That newly-insured constituency may not be as large as the bill’s architects originally hoped , or be composed of the range of buyers that the program ultimately needs . But it will be a fact on the ground to an extent that was by no means certain last December . And that fact will shape , and constrain , the options of the law’s opponents even in the event that Republicans manage to reclaim the White House two years hence .Such political and policy constraints , I should note , are potentially a good thing for would-be conservative reformers , since the serious right-of-center alternatives to Obamacare have always included policies to expand coverage , and with a coverage expansion accomplished , Republicans may find themselves effectively forced in a more serious direction . ( This is a drum that Avik Roy , among others , has been beating for some time . ) Or so I would hope ; of course , they might just end up drifting toward gimmicky micro-reforms instead , or find themselves embroiled a ruinous civil war over how hard to push toward some kind of full repeal .But wherever they go and whatever they do , they will have to deal with the reality that Obamacare , thrice-buried , looks very much alive .
WashingtonIF Mitt Romney’s pivots on President’s Obama’s health care reform act have accelerated to a blur — from repealing on Day 1 , to preserving this or that piece , to punting the decision to the states — it is for an odd reason buried beneath two and a half years of Republican political condemnations : the architecture of the Affordable Care Act is based on conservative , not liberal , ideas about individual responsibility and the power of market forces .This fundamental ideological paradox , drowned out by partisan shouting since before the plan’s passage in 2010 , explains why Obamacare has only lukewarm support from many liberals , who wanted a real , not imagined , “government takeover of health care.” It explains why Republicans have been unable since its passage to come up with anything better . And it explains why the law is nearly identical in design to the legislation Mr. Romney passed in Massachusetts while governor .The core drivers of the health care act are market principles formulated by conservative economists , designed to correct structural flaws in our health insurance system — principles originally embraced by Republicans as a market alternative to the Clinton plan in the early 1990s . The president’s program extends the current health care system — mostly employer-based coverage , administered by commercial health insurers , with care delivered by fee-for-service doctors and hospitals — by removing the biggest obstacles to that system’s functioning like a competitive marketplace .Chief among these obstacles are market limitations imposed by the problematic nature of health insurance , which requires that younger , healthier people subsidize older , sicker ones . Because such participation is often expensive and always voluntary , millions have simply opted out , a risky bet emboldened by the 24/7 presence of the heavily subsidized emergency room down the street . The health care law forcibly repatriates these gamblers , along with those who can not afford to participate in a market that ultimately cross-subsidizes their medical misfortunes anyway , when they get sick and show up in that E.R . And it outlaws discrimination against those who want to participate but can not because of their medical histories . Put aside the considerable legislative detritus of the act , and its aim is clear : to rationalize a dysfunctional health insurance marketplace .This explains why the health insurance industry has been quietly supporting the plan all along . It levels the playing field and expands the potential market by tens of millions of new customers .The rationalization and extension of the current market is financed by the other linchpin of the law : the mandate that we all carry health insurance , an idea forged not by liberal social engineers at the Brookings Institution but by conservative economists at the Heritage Foundation . The individual mandate recognizes that millions of Americans who could buy health insurance choose not to , because it requires trading away today’s wants for tomorrow’s needs . The mandate is about personal responsibility — a hallmark of conservative thought .IN the partisan war sparked by the 2008 election , Republicans conveniently forgot that this was something many of them had supported for years . The only thing wrong with the mandate ? Mr. Obama also thought it was a good idea .The same goes for health insurance exchanges , another idea formulated by conservatives and supported by Republican governors and legislators across the country for years . An exchange is as pro-market a mechanism as they come : free up buyers and sellers , standardize the products , add pricing transparency , and watch what happens . Market Economics 101 .In the shouting match over the health care law , most have somehow missed another of its obvious virtues : it enshrines accountability — yes , another conservative idea . Under today’s system , most health insurers ( and providers ) are accountable to the wrong people , often for the wrong reasons , with the needs of patients coming last . With the transparency , mobility and choice of the exchanges , businesses and individuals can decide for themselves which insurers ( and , embedded in their networks , which providers ) deserve their dollars . They can see , thanks to the often derided benefits standardization of the reform act , what they are actually buying . They can shop around . And businesses are free to decide that they are better off opting out , paying into funds that subsidize individuals’ coverage and letting their employees do their own shopping , with what is , in essence , their own compensation , relocated to the exchanges .Back when the idea of letting businesses and consumers pick their own plans — with their own money on an exchange — first floated around Washington , advocates called them “association health plans.” They , too , would have corrected for the lack of transparency , mobility and choice in local insurance markets by allowing the purchase of health insurance across state lines . They were the cornerstone of what would have been the Bush administration’s reform plan ( had the administration not been distracted by other matters ) . After the rejection of “Hillarycare” in the mid-’90s , association health plans emerged as the centerpiece of pro-market , Republican thinking about health reform — essentially what would become Romneycare , extended via federal law to cover the entire country . So much for Mr. Romney’s argument that his plan in Massachusetts was an expression of states’ rights . His own party had bigger plans for the rest of the country , and they looked a lot like Obamacare .
WE need death panels .Well , maybe not death panels , exactly , but unless we start allocating health care resources more prudently — rationing , by its proper name — the exploding cost of Medicare will swamp the federal budget .But in the pantheon of toxic issues — the famous “third rails” of American politics — none stands taller than overtly acknowledging that elderly Americans are not entitled to every conceivable medical procedure or pharmaceutical .Most notably , President Obama’s estimable Affordable Care Act regrettably includes severe restrictions on any reduction in Medicare services or increase in fees to beneficiaries . In 2009 , Sarah Palin’s rant about death panels even forced elimination from the bill of a provision to offer end-of-life consultations .Now , three years on , the Republican vice-presidential nominee , Paul D. Ryan , has offered his latest ambitious plan for addressing the Medicare problem . But like Mr. Obama’s , it holds limited promise for containing the program’s escalating costs within sensible boundaries .The Obama and Ryan plans are not without common ground ; both propose an identical formula for capping the growth in Medicare spending per beneficiary . And both dip into the same toolbox ( particularly lower payments to providers ) to achieve a reduction of nearly $ 1 trillion in Medicare expenditures over the next decade from projected levels .That’s where the agreement ends . Mr. Ryan believes that meeting the goal over the long term requires introducing more competition into Medicare through vouchers to purchase private insurance .But Ryan’s approach was rendered toothless when the issue’s brutal politics forced him to retreat from his initial tough plan to simply cap the growth in government spending on Medicare and stick the inevitable overage onto beneficiaries . Under his revised plan , private insurers would be required to offer the same level of benefits as traditional Medicare , meaning that any savings would have to come from unidentified efficiencies ( the ever-popular “waste , fraud and abuse” ) .If the cap was breached — as it almost certainly would eventually be — Mr. Ryan blithely says , “Congress would be required to intervene.” Fat chance ; Congress regularly does the opposite when it rolls back caps on payments to doctors and hospitals .Meanwhile , Mr. Obama’s hopes for sustained cost containment are pinned on a to-be-determined mix of squeezing reimbursements , embracing a selection of the creative ideas that have spewed forth from health care policy wonks and scouring the globe for innovations .To Mr. Obama’s credit , his plan has more teeth than Mr. Ryan’s ; if his Independent Payment Advisory Board comes up with savings , Congress must accept either them or vote for an equivalent package . The problem is , the advisory board can’t propose reducing benefits ( a k a rationing ) or raising fees ( another form of rationing ) , without which the spending target looms impossibly large .That’s the view of the bipartisan Medicare trustees , whose 2012 report stated : “Actual future Medicare expenditures are likely to exceed the intermediate projections shown in this report , possibly by quite large amounts.”To be sure , health care cost increases have moderated , in part because of the recession and in part because Medicare has been tightening its reimbursements . But those thumbscrews can’t be tightened forever ; Medicare reimbursement rates are already well below those of private providers .Let’s not forget that with the elderly population growing rapidly , even if cost increases for each beneficiary can be contained , Medicare would still claim a rising share of the American economy .Medicare needs to take a cue from Willie Sutton , who reportedly said he robbed banks because that’s where the money was . The big money in Medicare is not to be found in Mr. Ryan’s competition or Mr. Obama’s innovation , but in reducing the cost of treating people in the last year of life , which consumes more than a quarter of the program’s budget .No one wants to lose an aging parent . And with price out of the equation , it’s natural for patients and their families to try every treatment , regardless of expense or efficacy . But that imposes an enormous societal cost that few other nations have been willing to bear . Many countries whose health care systems are regularly extolled — including Canada , Australia and New Zealand — have systems for rationing care .Take Britain , which provides universal coverage with spending at proportionately almost half of American levels . Its National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence uses a complex quality-adjusted life year system to put an explicit value ( up to about $ 48,000 per year ) on a treatment’s ability to extend life .At the least , the Independent Payment Advisory Board should be allowed to offer changes in services and costs . We may shrink from such stomach-wrenching choices , but they are inescapable .
Although few Americans say the Affordable Care Act has helped them , the uninsured rate has declined significantly since the law took effect , and appears to be leveling off at around 13.4 percent .Via GallupThe uninsured rate so far in the second quarter of 2014 is 13.4 % , with the rate in April and May as individual months also averaging 13.4 % , respectively .…The percentage of U.S. adults lacking insurance coverage in the first two months of the second quarter of 2014 is down from 17.1 % in the fourth quarter of 2013 and from the 15.6 % average in the first quarter of 2014 . The current 13.4 % average for the second quarter of 2014 is the lowest level recorded since Gallup began tracking this measure in 2008 .
The Congressional Budget Office said yesterday that the Affordable Care Act should be cheaper than originally projected .Via The New RepublicIn February , the last time CBO addressed these issues comprehensively , it predicted that the net cost of the law’s coverage provisions would be about $ 1.4 trillion over ten years . Now , CBO says , it’s likely to be about $ 1.3 trillion , or $ 100 billion less .It’s actually the latest in a series of revisions , each one suggesting the law would cost less money than the previous projection had suggested . And why this latest change ? It doesn’t appear to be because the law will reach fewer people . CBO now expects slightly more people to end up with health insurance , at least over the long run . The CBO’s primary explanation for lower costs is that health insurance premiums on the new exchanges — what the administration calls “marketplaces”— are lower than CBO had originally expected they would be .
The Obama administration said yesterday that it would treat the March 31 deadline for enrolling in a health plan somewhat flexibly . Consumers who begin to apply by March 31 will have until mid-April to finish .Relatedly , according to the Kaiser Health Tracking Poll for March , “substantial shares” of the uninsured population don’t realize that the deadline to sign up for health insurance is fast approaching .“As the clock ticks down on open enrollment for new coverage options under the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) , the latest Kaiser Health Tracking Poll finds that six in ten of the uninsured are unaware of the March 31 deadline to sign up for coverage . When reminded of the deadline and the fine for not getting covered , half of those who lack coverage as of mid-March say they plan to remain uninsured . Meanwhile , four in ten of the uninsured are still unaware of the law’s subsidies to help lower-income Americans purchase coverage , and half don’t know about the law’s expansion of Medicaid.”
The current state of public opinion on health reform is really peculiar . If you’ve been following the issue at all closely , you know that the Affordable Care Act is one of the great comeback stories of public policy : after a terrible start , it has dramatically exceeded expectations . But hardly anyone seems to know that .It’s easy to understand how that happens for Fox-watchers and Rush-listeners , who are fed a steady diet of supposed Obamacare disaster stories . Remember this ?But the real story hasn’t even gotten through to many people who should know better .Over the weekend I had dinner in NYC with some very smart , sophisticated people ; yes , all of them liberals . And almost everyone in the group was under the impression that Obamacare is still going badly — they wanted me to tell them whether it could still be turned around .Meanwhile , New York ( which created its own exchange ) is a huge success story : enrollment is 60 percent higher than federal projections , premiums have been cut in half .An aside : New York was already a community-rating state , where insurers weren’t allowed to discriminate based on medical history . But the result of that system was that healthy people tended to stay out of the individual market , creating a bad risk pool that drove up rates . Now everyone has to be in , dramatically improving the risk pool . As such , the New York experiences demonstrates the essential role of the individual mandate for reform .But anyway , back to the mystery : here we have smart , pro-reform people living in a state where reform is going really well . And they don’t know it !In part this may reflect the Obama administration’s lackluster job so far in getting the word out . But it also , I think , reflects a persistent anti-ACA tilt in news coverage . In the final days of March I wrote about the de facto blackout on the obvious surge in enrollments ; if you weren’t reading Charles Gaba and/or bloggers who followed him , you were in the dark about a huge developing story . And this tilt has continued .Just FYI : the article I linked above , about the spectacular success of New York reform , was on page A16 …
LOS ANGELES â THE Anthem Blue Cross representative who answered my call told me that there was a silver lining in the cancellation of my individual P.P.O . policy and the $ 5,400 annual increase that I would have to pay for the Affordable Care Act-compliant option : now if I have Stage 4 cancer or need a sex-change operation , Iâd be covered regardless of pre-existing conditions . Never mind that the new provider network would eliminate coverage for my and my sonâs long-term doctors and hospitals .The Anthem rep cheerily explained that despite the companyâs â I paraphrase â draconian rates and limited network , my benefits , which also include maternity coverage ( handy for a 46-year-old ) , would âbe actually much richer.âI , of course , would be actually much poorer . And it was this aspect of the bum deal that , to my surprise , turned out to be a very unpopular thing to gripe about .âObamacare or Kafkacare ? â I posted on Facebook as soon as I hung up with Anthem . I vented about the call and wrote that the president should be protecting the middle class , not making our lives substantially harder . For extra sympathy , I may have thrown in the fact that Iâm a single mom . ( O.K. , I did . )Then I sat back and waited for the love to pour in . Or at least the âlike.â Lots of likes . After all , I have 1,037 Facebook friends . Surely , theyâd commiserate .Except that they didnât .Instead , aside from my friend David , who attempted to cheer me up with , âMy dad , who never turns down a bargain , would take the sex change just because itâs free , â my respondents implied â in posts that , to my annoyance , kept getting more âlikesâ â that it was beyond uncool to be whining about myself when the less fortunate would finally have insurance .âThe nation has been better off , â wrote one friend . âOver 33 million people who did not have insurance are now going to get it.â Thatâs all fine and good for âthe nation , â but what about my $ 5,400 rate hike ( after-tax dollars , I wanted to add , but dared not in this group of previously closeted Mother Teresas ) ? Another friend wrote , âYes , Iâm paying an extra 200 a month , but Iâm okay with doing that so that others who need it can have health care.âI was shocked . Who knew my friends were such humanitarians ? Has Obamacare made it un-P.C . to be concerned by a serious burden on my familyâs well-being ?The heated reactions even moved offline . Frustrated , I observed to one friend who was covered through her work that when an issue didnât affect people directly , they became âtheoretically generous.â Ask them to donate several thousand dollars so that the less fortunate can have medical insurance â which is exactly what President Obama is asking me to do â and Iâll bet theyâd change their tune about âending inequalityâ and âcreating fairnessâ and âdoing whatâs good for the country.âRefreshingly , the two people who showed real empathy were my insurance broker and my friend Nicole , who sent daily links to news stories about people who were also stripped of their coverage and mandated to buy expensive exchange or private policies without access to their current doctors , yet just missed the cutoff for subsidies .There was one story about people suing Anthem for not being grandfathered in after changing their policies post-2010 . In fact , it was in 2011 that I altered mine , dumping maternity benefits so that I didnât have to pay for everyone elseâs pregnancies . Little did I know Iâd end up losing my insurance and paying for everyone elseâs pregnancies .There was even an article about a cancer patient who had lost access to her doctors . To her credit , Nicole refrained from saying , âBut , Lori , this woman has cancer and you are so much more fortunate ! âLike Bridget Jonesâs âsmug marrieds , â the âsmug insuredsâ â friends who were covered through their own or spousesâ employers or who were grandfathered into their plans â asked why I didnât âjustâ switch all of our long-term doctors , suck it up and pay an extra $ 200 a month for a restrictive network on the exchange , or marry the guy Iâm dating . How romantic : âI didnât marry you just to save money , honey . I married you for your provider network.âAlong with the smug insureds , President Obama doesnât care much about the relatively small percentage of us with canceled coverage and no viable replacement . He keeps apologizing while maintaining that itâs for the good of the country , a vast improvement âover all.âAnd the âover allâ might agree . But the self-employed middle class is being sacrificed at the altar of politically correct rhetoric , with nobody helping to ensure our health , fiscal or otherwise , because itâs trendy to cheer for the underdog . Embracing the noble cause is all very well â as long as yours isnât the âfortunateâ family that loses its access to comprehensive , affordable health care while the rest of the nation gets it .The truly noble act here is being performed by my friend Nicole , who keeps posting Obamacare fiasco stories on my Facebook page , despite being conspicuously ignored , except for my single âlike.â Itâs the lone âlikeâ that falls in the forest , the click nobody wants to hear .
FRANKFORT , Ky. â SUNDAY morning news programs identify Kentucky as the red state with two high-profile Republican senators who claim their rhetoric represents an electorate that gave President Obama only about a third of its presidential vote in 2012 .So why then is Kentucky â more quickly than almost any other state â moving to implement the Affordable Care Act ?Because thereâs a huge disconnect between the rank partisanship of national politics and the outlook of governors whose job it is to help beleaguered families , strengthen work forces , attract companies and create a balanced budget .Itâs no coincidence that numerous governors â not just Democrats like me but also Republicans like Jan Brewer of Arizona , John Kasich of Ohio and Rick Snyder of Michigan â see the Affordable Care Act not as a referendum on President Obama but as a tool for historic change .That is especially true in Kentucky , a state where residentsâ collective health has long been horrendous . The state ranks among the worst , if not the worst , in almost every major health category , including smoking , cancer deaths , preventable hospitalizations , premature death , heart disease and diabetes .Weâre making progress , but incremental improvements are not enough . We need big solutions with the potential for transformational change .The Affordable Care Act is one of those solutions .For the first time , we will make affordable health insurance available to every single citizen in the state . Right now , 640,000 people in Kentucky are uninsured . Thatâs almost one in six Kentuckians .Lack of health coverage puts their health and financial security at risk .They roll the dice and pray they donât get sick . They choose between food and medicine . They ignore checkups that would catch serious conditions early . They put off doctorâs appointments , hoping a condition turns out to be nothing . And they live knowing that bankruptcy is just one bad diagnosis away .Furthermore , their children go long periods without checkups that focus on immunizations , preventive care and vision and hearing tests . If they have diabetes , asthma or infected gums , their conditions remain untreated and unchecked .For Kentucky as a whole , the negative impact is similar but larger â jacked-up costs , decreased worker productivity , lower quality of life , depressed school attendance and a poor image .The Affordable Care Act will address these weaknesses .Some 308,000 of Kentuckyâs uninsured â mostly the working poor â will be covered when we increase Medicaid eligibility guidelines to 138 percent of the federal poverty level .PricewaterhouseCoopers and the Urban Studies Institute at the University of Louisville concluded that expanding Medicaid would inject $ 15.6 billion into Kentuckyâs economy over the next eight years , create almost 17,000 new jobs , have an $ 802.4 million positive budget impact ( by transferring certain expenditures from the state to the federal government , among other things ) , protect hospitals from cuts in indigent care funding and shield businesses from up to $ 48 million in annual penalties .In short , we couldnât afford not to do it .The other 332,000 uninsured Kentuckians will be able to access affordable coverage â most with a discount â through the Health Benefit Exchange , the online insurance marketplace we named Kynect : Kentuckyâs Healthcare Connection .Kentucky is the only Southern state both expanding Medicaid and operating a state-based exchange , and we remain on target to meet the Oct. 1 deadline to open Kynect with the support of a call center that is providing some 100 jobs . Having been the first state-based exchange to complete the readiness review with the United States Department of Health and Human Services , we hope to become the first one to be certified .Frankly , we canât implement the Affordable Care Act fast enough .As for naysayers , Iâm offended by their partisan gamesmanship , as they continue to pour time , money and energy into overturning or defunding the Affordable Care Act . Itâs shameful that these critics havenât invested that same level of energy into trying to improve the health of our citizens .They insist that the Affordable Care Act will never work â when in fact a similar approach put into effect in Massachusetts by Mitt Romney , then the governor , is working .So , to those more worried about political power than Kentuckyâs families , I say , âGet over it.âThe Affordable Care Act was approved by Congress and sanctioned by the Supreme Court . It is the law of the land .Get over it ... and get out of the way so I can help my people . Here in Kentucky , we can not afford to waste another day or another life .
Conservatives appear to be really upset that liberals are actually taking on the facts in the anti-Obamacare ads they’ve been running . How dare you question whether the people in these ads are giving an accurate picture — they’re suffering !OK , we’ve seen this kind of play before . Remember how anyone suggesting that Dick Cheney and whatshisname misled us into invading Iraq was attacking American’s brave fighting men and women ?But there’s a different kind of struggle anyone trying to point out the facts encounters — a barrage of anecdotes . You say that the Obamacare horror stories are fake , but I kind of know this man who is being told that he has to buy a policy he can’t possibly afford / I read this sad story in the Wall Street Journal / I heard this tale on the radio / etc..How do you answer that ?Well , it can’t be done retail . If the Koch brothers are pouring money into ads featuring a person , or the GOP response to the SOTU tells a story , then it’s worth trying to track down the particulars of this case . But to deal with the broader problem of anecdotes , what you need is a framework that tells you which anecdotes are almost surely wrong .So here’s what you need to understand . The Affordable Care Act isn’t magic — it produces losers as well as winners . But it’s not black magic either , turning everyone into a loser . What the Act does is in effect to increase the burden on fortunate people — the healthy and wealthy — to lift some burdens on the less fortunate : people with chronic illnesses or other preexisting conditions , low-income workers .Suppose , then , that someone comes to you with an anecdote about a cancer patient , or just an older person in poor health , and tells you that this person is about to lose the care she needs , or face a huge increase in expenses , under Obamacare . Well , it’s almost certainly not true — people like that are overwhelmingly beneficiaries of health reform , thanks to community rating , which means that they can’t be discriminated against because of their condition .Or suppose that someone tells you about a struggling worker who had adequate coverage but is now being confronted with unaffordable premiums . You should immediately ask , what about the subsidies ? Because the Affordable Care Act has subsidies that are there specifically to keep premiums affordable for lower earners .If someone insists that he knows about someone in these categories who really is being grievously hurt , well , the burden of proof rests with the claimant . Basically , stories like that are going to be very rare .Obamacare opponents could , of course , go with the real losers — people in the one percent paying higher taxes , healthy young men who are getting by with cheap , minimalist policies . But they want sob stories — the sick middle-aged woman facing tragedy . And so far , every single one of those sob stories has turned out to be false — because the very nature of the reform is such that such things hardly ever happen .
Until just the other day , Obamacare was a total disaster ; no way would it meet its first-year enrollment targets , or come anywhere close .Now the opponents have retreated to their next line of defense : OK , people are signing up , but only because their existing policies were cancelled , so the program isn’t actually reducing the number of uninsured .Oops:Furthermore:These early estimates understate the full effects of the Affordable Care Act on the uninsured for two major reasons . First , the survey does not capture the enrollment surge that occurred at the end of the open enrollment period , because 80 percent of the responses to the March 2014 HRMS were provided by March 6 , 2014 . Second , these estimates do not reflect the effects of some important ACA provisions ( such as the ability to keep dependents on health plans until age 26 and early state Medicaid expansions ) that were implemented before 2013 .Remember , this is just the first year . It has been assumed all along that it would take several years for the word to spread , and the law to have its full effect .
You might think that the methodical extermination of millions of Jews by a brutal regime intent on world domination would resist appropriation as an all-purpose metaphor . You might think that genocide , of all things , would be safe from conversion into sloppy simile .Youâd be wrong .After Paul Ryanâs fact-challenged address at the Republican National Convention last year , the chairman of the Democratic Party in California actually compared him and his compatriots to the Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels . A short time later , the chairman of the Democratic Party in South Carolina likened that stateâs Republican governor , Nikki Haley , to Adolf Hitlerâs mistress , Eva Braun .At that point Abraham Foxman , the national director of the Anti-Defamation League , did what he shouldnât need to do even once , let alone the multiple times that heâs been forced to . He implored politicians and pundits to stop it already .No matter . Allusions to Nazi Germany were back for debates over gun control and , of course , Obamacare . Ted Cruz , the Senateâs prince of tirades , compared people who claim that the new insurance program canât be stopped to those who rolled over for Hitler and the Third Reich . This prompted a public reprimand from John McCain , who has developed something of a sideline career of swatting Cruz on the nose . Theyâre like a hapless master and his hopeless dachshund . The former keeps trying to housebreak the latter , while the latter just beams at every mess he makes .Itâs not only Nazis who are flourishing in this era of metaphors gone mad , of analogy bloat . Lynch mobs are also having a good go of it . A senator who was quoted anonymously in The Times last week used that term to describe the Republican lawmakers who had lit into Cruz during a private luncheon , and lynching was invoked more disturbingly by the chief executive officer of A.I.G. , who recently said that public complaints about Wall Street bankersâ bonuses were intended âto get everybody out there with their pitchforks and their hangman nooses.â This , he added , was âsort of like what we did in the Deep South.âHow absolutely bonkers . And yet how unsurprising . Weâre awash these days in metaphors as overworked as our political debate is overwrought , and itâs impossible not to wonder how much one contributes to the other . When nuance and perspective exit the language , do they exit the conversation as well ? When you speak in ludicrous extremes , do you think that way , too ?Obamacare has proved to be not just ideologically divisive but linguistically fertile . Thereâs seemingly no event or passage in American history to which it canât be compared .The terrorist attacks of 9/11 ? Check . Back when Mike Pence , Indianaâs Republican governor , was still in Congress , he summoned that dayâs horror to characterize the Supreme Court ruling that upheld the Affordable Care Act .Slavery ? Check . Ken Cuccinelli , the Republican candidate for governor of Virginia , has described opposition to Obamacare in terms of stands against fugitive slave laws .The hyperbole and hysteria make any constructive debate impossible , and they insult the past , robbing important events of the specific meaning and individual detail they deserve . Consider our recurring â-gateâ mania . We equate each new scandal , whether extra-large or fun-size , with Watergate , and by willfully misremembering President Richard Nixonâs crimes , we dilute them . Itâs just a suffix for the taking , a point of comparison for such wildly unrelated matters as the spilled secrets of Arkansas law enforcement officers who were supposedly privy to Bill Clintonâs private life . Troopergate , that was called .For President Obama , Benghazi was supposed to be his Watergate , and so was the I.R.S.âs scrutiny of conservative groups , and so were a bunch of other things I canât even remember anymore . They blur and fade , which is not to say they didnât matter . Itâs to say that when everything is supposedly like everything else , nothingâs distinctive . Itâs all one big mush .For that reason , among others , we should watch our words . They have consequences . As irresponsible and detestable as the recent actions of the most conservative wing of House Republicans have been , weâd be better off without figurative talk of hostage taking and guns to heads , without headlines like one in The Huffington Post that said : âBoehner Threatens to Shoot the Hostage.â That sort of language only turns up the heat .And I cringe at how pointlessly hurtful it must have been for a 9/11 widow or widower to listen to the right-wing moralist Gary Bauer exhort voters to fight back against President Obamaâs agenda the way passengers on United Flight 93 fought back against hijackers . Or for Holocaust survivors to hear all this gratuitous Nazi talk .You know whatâs just like Germany in the 1930s ? Germany in the 1930s . Weâre in an unfortunate place , but we neednât travel back there to describe it .
Like confused poll respondents , Scott Brown , the former Massachusetts Senator who’s running for Senate in New Hampshire , says he thinks the Affordable Care Act is disastrous , but seems to like everything it does .Via VoxIn an interview with WBUR , he called Obamacare a “disaster.” Then he was asked what he’s for — and he went on to describe Obamacare . “I’ve always felt that people should either get some type of health care options , or pay for it with a nice competitive fee , ” he said . “That’s all great . I believe it in my heart . In terms of preexisting conditions , catastrophic coverages , covering kids , whatever we want to do.” He even said it could “include the Medicaid expansion [ for ] folks who need that care and coverage.”Oh , he also promises his plan won’t raise taxes , cut spending on Medicare , or make people drive very far to go to the hospital . So his plan will have more generous insurance options and no way to pay for them . In other words , his plan will be like Obamacare , but even better ! Call it Fauxbamacare .
Ezra Klein , in his new capacity as one of the impresarios behind Vox , has written a pair of attention-grabbing posts — here , and then here — defending the proposition that Obamacare has , in some sense , “won , ” and that conservatives who can’t come to terms with that victory can’t come to terms with reality itself . Reading them , it struck me that this argument would benefit from laying down some specific markers for the near future , because Klein seems to move back and forth between two definitions of success . At times , as when he writes that Obamacare “has won its survival” and allows that that “there are still many good critiques to make” of the law , he seems to be using a narrow definition , with which I mostly agree — the law won’t collapse under its own weight , the enrollment levels are high enough to make a return to the coverage status quo ante unlikely , etc . But when he uses language like “the individual mandate … is working” and “the law is back on its expected track , ” and concludes that “ [ Kathleen Sebelius ] can leave with the law she helped build looking , shockingly , like a success , ” it implies a stronger definition of victory , in which Obamacare isn’t just continuing , isn’t just unlikely to be swiftly repealed , but is clearly succeeding as a policy in basically the way its advocates predicted that it would .So I think it would be useful for the law’s supporters to specify the metrics/numbers/outcomes that would vindicate the latter claim . Here are three fronts where specificity would be helpful:Enrollment . In the summer of 2012 , after the Supreme Court decision freeing up states to reject the Medicaid expansion , the C.B.O . projected that 14 million Americans would get coverage under Obamacare in the first year , and 33 million by 2022 . This February , after the botched rollout , the projections were 13 million in 2014 , 27 million in the long run . The latest estimate , out this month , drops the 2014 projection down to 12 million , and the long-term number to 26 million . Meanwhile , the question of how many previously-uninsured people have gained insurance as of right now is , as this Vox explainer suggests , quite difficult to answer ( and sadly , it may be about to become even more difficult ) , but a guesstimate of 9-10 million seems pretty plausible — and short , N.B. , of even the C.B.O.’s more modest projection for this year .So … how low can the numbers go before they start to make the law look like something less than a success ? I assume that liberals will declare victory , with some reason , if Obamacare meets the C.B.O.’s current ( reduced ) expectations , this year and beyond . But what if it doesn’t ? Suppose that by the end of 2016 , when the C.B.O . expects the total number of uninsured to have fallen by 25 million , it’s only fallen by , say , 15 million instead — and most of the previously uninsured are getting coverage through Medicare , while the exchanges are mostly populated by people whose prior individual-market coverage was cancelled , either in 2014 or once grandfathering runs out . Will that be a success story ? Presumably there’s some kind of shortfall that the law’s supporters would consider , if not a sign of outright failure , than at least a reason to be fairly disappointed with how Obamacare has worked . It would be helpful to know what they think that long-run number lies .The cost curve . Before we entered into the agony of the botched roll-out , the law’s supporters were eagerly citing the persistently low rate of health care inflation as a sign that Obamacare was already working as designed , already having a beneficial effect . But as Vox’s Sarah Kliff reported yesterday , the latest inflation numbers cast some doubt on that hopeful hypothesis , with federal data indicating “that health care spending is now growing just as quickly as it was prior to the recession.”Now this may be temporary : Some kind of cost inflation was always likely to be associated with this year’s roll-out of subsidies and Medicaid spending , and the law’s supporters can reasonably argue that we should wait a few years , until the coverage expansion ( however large ) has become a normal feature of the system , to judge Obamacare’s impact on inflation overall .But at a certain point that judgment will need to be made . So , again , what should be the standard ? What should be the baseline ? Does Obamacare need to hold inflation to the low 2011-2012 pace ( a pace , again , that many liberals wanted to credit to its early impact ) in order to be counted as a cost-containing success ? Does it just need to hold inflation below , say , a 10 or 20-year average ? ( Note that both on its own terms and relative to overall inflation , health cost inflation had been declining for seven years before Obamacare was passed — so just holding either rate below the average of 2000-2010 would not actually be that impressive . ) In other words — what does the Affordable Care Act have to achieve in order to live up to its name ?Health outcomes . It’s been crowded out by the website drama like everything else , but one of the major divides between Obamacare supporters and skeptics was over whether , and to what extent , the law would literally be a lifesaver — with writers like Klein famously invoking “lives saved” figures in the hundreds of thousands during the run-up to the law’s passage , while doubters cited the surprisingly-weak link between insurance status and health outcomes , and raised the potential public-health downsides , in terms of innovations lost or never sought , of increasing government control .Now public health data can be even fuzzier and more debatable than cost inflation and enrollment numbers . But even with lower-than-hoped-for enrollment figures overall , we should still be able to see some of the happy consequences , at some point , if Klein et . al . are right : Looking back from 2020 or 2025 , certainly , there should be some kind of disjuncture between U.S. health outcomes pre- and post-Obamacare ( maybe a reversal of this trend , at the very least ? ) , and some kind of outcomes gap should open between states that implemented the law fully and states that refused the extra Medicaid dollars .So here , too , I’m curious what liberals expect to see , what they’ll count as vindication , what would disappoint them , and what kind of results they think will be sufficient to prove that Obamacare is , in fact , a lifesaving success .And then for my own part , I’ll lay down this marker for the future : If , in 2023 , the uninsured rate is where the C.B.O . currently projects or lower , health inflation’s five-year average is running below the post-World War II norm , and the trend in the age-adjusted mortality rate shows a positive alteration starting right about now , I will write a post ( or send out a Singularity-wide transmission , maybe ) entitled “I Was Wrong About Obamacare” — or , if he prefers , just “Ezra Klein Was Right.”
TODAY marks the beginning of health care coverage under the Affordable Care Act’s new insurance exchanges , for which two million Americans have signed up . Now that the individual mandate is officially here , let me begin with an admission : Obamacare is awful .That is the dirty little secret many liberals have avoided saying out loud for fear of aiding the president’s enemies , at a time when the ideal of universal health care needed all the support it could get . Unfortunately , this meant that instead of blaming companies like Novartis , which charges leukemia patients $ 90,000 annually for the drug Gleevec , or health insurance chief executives like Stephen Hemsley of UnitedHealth Group , who made nearly $ 102 million in 2009 , for the sky-high price of American health care , the president’s Democratic supporters bought into the myth that it was all those people going to get free colonoscopies and chemotherapy for the fun of it .I believe Obamacare’s rocky start — clueless planning , a lousy website , insurance companies raising rates , and the president’s telling people they could keep their coverage when , in fact , not all could — is a result of one fatal flaw : The Affordable Care Act is a pro-insurance-industry plan implemented by a president who knew in his heart that a single-payer , Medicare-for-all model was the true way to go . When right-wing critics “expose” the fact that President Obama endorsed a single-payer system before 2004 , they’re actually telling the truth .What we now call Obamacare was conceived at the Heritage Foundation , a conservative think tank , and birthed in Massachusetts by Mitt Romney , then the governor . The president took Romneycare , a program designed to keep the private insurance industry intact , and just improved some of its provisions . In effect , the president was simply trying to put lipstick on the dog in the carrier on top of Mitt Romney’s car . And we knew it .By 2017 , we will be funneling over $ 100 billion annually to private insurance companies . You can be sure they’ll use some of that to try to privatize Medicare .For many people , the “affordable” part of the Affordable Care Act risks being a cruel joke . The cheapest plan available to a 60-year-old couple making $ 65,000 a year in Hartford , Conn. , will cost $ 11,800 in annual premiums . And their deductible will be $ 12,600 . If both become seriously ill , they might have to pay almost $ 25,000 in a single year . ( Pre-Obamacare , they could have bought insurance that was cheaper but much worse , potentially with unlimited out-of-pocket costs . )And yet — I would be remiss if I didn’t say this — Obamacare is a godsend . My friend Donna Smith , who was forced to move into her daughter’s spare room at age 52 because health problems bankrupted her and her husband , Larry , now has cancer again . As she undergoes treatment , at least she won’t be in terror of losing coverage and becoming uninsurable . Under Obamacare , her premium has been cut in half , to $ 456 per month .Let’s not take a victory lap yet , but build on what there is to get what we deserve : universal quality health care .Those who live in red states need the benefit of Medicaid expansion . It may have seemed like smart politics in the short term for Republican governors to grab the opportunity offered by the Supreme Court rulings that made Medicaid expansion optional for states , but it was long-term stupid : If those 20 states hold out , they will eventually lose an estimated total of $ 20 billion in federal funds per year — money that would be going to hospitals and treatment .In blue states , let’s lobby for a public option on the insurance exchange — a health plan run by the state government , rather than a private insurer . In Massachusetts , State Senator James B. Eldridge is trying to pass a law that would set one up . Some counties in California are also trying it . Montana came up with another creative solution . Gov . Brian Schweitzer , a Democrat who just completed two terms , set up several health clinics to treat state workers , with no co-pays and no deductibles . The doctors there are salaried employees of the state of Montana ; their only goal is their patients’ health . ( If this sounds too much like big government to you , you might like to know that Google , Cisco and Pepsi do exactly the same . )All eyes are on Vermont’s plan for a single-payer system , starting in 2017 . If it flies , it will change everything , with many states sure to follow suit by setting up their own versions . That’s why corporate money will soon flood into Vermont to crush it . The legislators who’ll go to the mat for this will need all the support they can get : If you live east of the Mississippi , look up the bus schedule to Montpelier .So let’s get started . Obamacare can’t be fixed by its namesake . It’s up to us to make it happen .
A panel of the D.C. federal appellate court ruled today that the federal government does not have the authority to administer insurance subsidies in states that refused to set up their own exchanges . If the ruling stands—a big if—it could deprive millions of enrollees of the support they need to purchase health insurance .Via The Incidental EconomistHow much will this decision cost the working poor ? The amount varies with income and other variables , but for a 40 year old individual making $ 30,000 a year , the tax credit was estimated at $ 1345 ( KFF estimate here ) . Retroactive tax bills under Halbig will be significant and everyone impacted will have trouble paying for health insurance going forward ( about 57 % of exchange participants were previously uninsured , according to a KFF survey ) . How many people will be hurt ?At first glance : anyone receiving tax credits in the 27 states with federally facilitated exchanges ( FFEs ) : ( AL , AK , AZ , FL , GA , IN , KS , LA , ME , MS , MO , MT , NE , NJ , NC , ND , OH , OK , PN , SC , SD , TN , TX , UT , VA , WI and WY ; KFF list here ) . But the government reports 36 states as having FFEs , including 9 additional states not included on the list above ( ID , NM , AR , DE , IL , IA , MI , NH , and WV ; more on this below ) . Using this broader definition , 4.683 million Americans may now have a surprising tax bill and be at risk of losing health insurance , being told retroactively that they didn’t qualify for tax credits after all .
The Times has a very nice survey of the results to date of the Affordable Care Act , aka Obamacare , aka death panels and the moral equivalent of slavery .The verdict : It’s going well . A big expansion in coverage , which is affordable for a large majority ; the main exceptions seem to be people who went for the minimum coverage allowed , keeping premiums down but leaving large co-payments . None of the predictions of disaster has come even slightly true .
Yesterday , Ohio governor John Kasich briefly made news when the Associated Press quoted him saying that repeal of Obamacare was simply “not gon na happen , ” and adding that “the opposition to it was really either political or ideological , ” and in either case insufficiently attuned to the “real improvements in people’s lives.” Liberals pounced , conservatives groaned , and Kasich quickly went into damage control mode , explaining that he was only talking about the Medicaid expansion , which he had already explicitly supported and implemented , and not the rest of the law , which he still officially wants to ( say it with me ) repealandreplace .That last is the official position , of course , of the entire Republican Party , which currently enjoys , per my colleagues at The Upshot , a 66 percent chance of seizing a Senate majority in two weeks time . But the controversy around Kasich’s comments are a useful reminder that not only is there no Republican consensus on how to actually replace the health care law , but almost no G.O.P . Senate candidates are actually campaigning on a politically credible replacement plan — with “politically credible” defined , for reasons I’ve elaborated on before , as “not rolling coverage levels back toward the pre-Obamacare status quo.”The one major exception is Ed Gillespie , running against Mark Warner in Virginia , whose plan Ramesh Ponnuru has commented on and defended here and here . ( Since Gillespie’s background is in what I’ve called the “donorist” wing of the party , which does not always distinguish itself in pushing middle-class-friendly economic policy , he deserves particular credit for taking the policy leap . ) But Gillespie is also , per current polling , unlikely to join a Republican Senate majority next year , whereas many G.O.P . candidates — the potential Majority Leader included — who have hemmed and hawed or talked in anti-Obamacare boilerplate and vague generalities when asked about health care policy are more likely to pull their races out . Which will be seen by some , no doubt , as vindicating the risk-averse , somewhat cynical approach to health policy that Republicans have taken throughout the health care debate …… except , of course , that in this cycle that debate is happening against the backdrop of a political map that heavily favors the G.O.P. , whereas in 2016 ( as in 2012 ) the map will be different , tougher , and the health care law ( while no doubt still unpopular overall ) will be more locked-in , more a part of people’s ordinary experience , and the promise of full repeal will look even sketchier than it does now . At which point a Republican Party that wants to be competitive nationally will start to feel a lot of pressure ( probably not quite enough to counteract the influence of the primary electorate , but we’ll see ) to drift toward something like Kasich’s ( quite popular , in a purple state ) position , which basically amounts to “if you like the single-payer part of Obamacare , you can keep the single-payer part of Obamacare , and let’s talk about the other stuff later.”For conservatives who don’t want their party to gradually , eventually , inevitably end up taking roughly that position in national elections , then , there’s a pretty narrow window to rally around something like the Gillespie approach instead . That window was open in this campaign ; I think it will be open again in 2016 . After that , though , the political risks ( already real enough ) associated with backing a legitimate Obamacare alternative will rise apace , the downsides of calling for outright repeal will likewise increase , and Republicans running for office outside red states will probably just end up endorsing the views that Ohio’s popular governor is dancing around right now .Of course events might intervene , but for now anti-Obamacare but reform-minded conservatives should be rooting for Gillespie to pull off a miracle comeback … because a party that can not imitate his Obamacre position today will almost certainly accept John Kasich’s position tomorrow .
A peculiar aspect of the Obama years has been the disconnect between the rage of Obama’s enemies and the yawns of his sort-of allies . The right denounces financial reform as a vast government takeover — and lobbies fiercely against it — while the left dismisses reform as symbols without substance . The right accuses Obama of being a socialist stealing the money of hard-working billionaires , while the left dismisses him as having done nothing to address inequality .On all these issues , the truth is that Obama has done far more than he gets credit for — not everything you’d want , to be sure , or even most of what should be done , but enough so that the right has reason to be furious .The latest case in point : taxes on the one percent . I keep hearing that Obama has done nothing to make the one percent pay more ; the Congressional Budget Office does not agree:According to CBO , the effective tax rate on the one percent — reflecting the end of the Bush tax cuts at the top end , plus additional taxes associated with Obamacare — is now back to pre-Reagan levels . You could argue that we should have raised taxes at the top much more , to lean against the widening of market inequality , and I would agree . But it’s still a much bigger change than I think anyone on the left seems to realize .
Or , actually , demonstrates by example what’s wrong with Washington .Matt Yglesias finds Ron Fournier saying this about health reform:On health care , we needed a market-driven plan that decreases the percentage of uninsured Americans without convoluting the U.S. health care system . Just such a plan sprang out of conservative think tanks and was tested by a GOP governor in Massachusetts , Mitt Romney .Instead of a bipartisan agreement to bring that plan to scale , we got more partisan warfare . The GOP resisted , Obama surrendered his mantle of bipartisanship , and Democrats muscled through a one-sided law that has never been popular with a majority of the public .The mind reels . How is it possible for anyone who has been following politics and , presumably , policy for the past six years not to know that Obamacare is , in all important respects , identical to Romneycare ? It has the same three key provisions — nondiscrimination by insurers , a mandate for individuals , and subsidies to make the mandate workable . It was developed by the same people . I and many others have frequently referred to ObamaRomneycare .Well , I’ve know for years that many political pundits don’t think that understanding policy is part of their job . But this is still extreme . And I’m sorry to go after an individual here — but for God’s sake , don’t you have to know something about the actual content of a policy you critique ?And what’s actually going on here is worse than ignorance . It’s pretty clear that we’re watching a rule of thumb according to which if Republicans are against a proposal , that means it must be leftist and extreme , and the burden on the White House is to find a way to make the GOP happy . Needless to say , this rewards obstructionism — there is literally nothing Obama can do to convince some ( many ) pundits that he’s making a good faith effort , because they don’t pay any attention to what he does , only to the Republican reaction .Awesome .
Very busy , so no substantive posting today . But I did want to share a thought from the past few days . I posted about the surprisingly good news , at least so far , on Obamacare premiums for 2015 — and as usual was met with a wall of rage from the right . The idea that this thing might be working inspires a level of anger nothing else ( except maybe climate science ) matches .No news there . Nor is it news that such people know things that ain’t so . But there’s something I’ve noticed from the combination of reactions to what I write and researching past coverage of Obamacare . It goes like this : a lot of the untrue beliefs people have about Obamacare come not so much from outright false reporting as from selective reporting . Every suggestion of bad news gets highlighted — especially , of course , but not only by Fox , the WSJ , etc.. But when it turns out that the news wasn’t really that bad , these sources just move on . There are claims that millions of people are losing coverage — headlines ! When it turns out not to be true — crickets ! Some experts claim that premiums will rise by double digits — big news ! Actual premium numbers come in and they’re surprisingly low — not mentioned .The result is that most news consumers — who form impressions rather than trying to work out details — have the sense that it’s been all bad news . This is true even for people who don’t rely on Fox — I get asked about the scary premium hikes by people on the Upper West Side ! And of course for those who do get their news from Fox , well , they know , just know , that Obamacare has reduced the number of Americans with insurance and caused premiums to double or something , even though even their favorite news source isn’t saying such things .We need a term for beliefs based on reports that have been superseded ; maybe fossils instead of zombies . Anyway , it’s striking .
One thing about the Obamacare denialists : they don’t give up . First nobody but the sick would sign up , so we’d have a death spiral . Then it was “OK , a lot of people have signed up , but they won’t pay — and anyway , even more people have lost coverage.” Now they face evidence like this:And the response I’m seeing is “It’s not Obamacare , it’s the improving economy” .But it isn’t . The decline is too sharp , too closely associated with the enrollment period to be driven by the at best gradual improvement in the job market . But wait , there’s more . The Urban Institute breaks down the decline in uninsurance by Medicaid adoption or not , which is closely correlated with the general question of whether states are helping implementation or blocking it . Here’s how it looks:Sorry , an improving economy can’t explain why the decline in uninsured is three times as large in pro-Obamacare states as it is in anti-reform states .It’s the policy , stupid .
President Obama wrote on Monday that the Federal Communications Commission should issue strong regulations to prevent cable and phone companies from dividing the Internet into fast and slow lanes .Writing in more detail than he has offered previously on the subject , Mr. Obama said the commission , which is independent of the administration , should undo a long-standing regulatory mistake by re-classifying broadband Internet service as a telecommunications service , not a lightly-regulated information service . That would allow the commission to ban cable and phone companies from blocking , slowing down or otherwise interfering with the videos , music and other content that their customers access on the Internet . As we wrote in an editorial on Sunday , under current rules companies like Verizon and Time Warner Cable have the right to favor some content over others . For example , they could decide to deliver content from a provider that pays them a fee faster than information from competing services . Such arrangements would limit consumer choice and the ability of start-ups to compete on the Web .“We can not allow Internet service providers ( ISPs ) to restrict the best access or to pick winners and losers in the online marketplace for services and ideas , ” Mr. Obama wrote .Not surprisingly , cable and phone companies and some of their supporters in Congress are not happy with Mr. Obama’s proposal . Comcast issued a statement calling it “a radical reversal that would harm investment and innovation , as today’s immediate stock market reaction demonstrates.” ( Shares of Comcast were down 3.8 percent at noon , but shares in Verizon and AT & T were up slightly . ) Senator Ted Cruz tried , confusingly and desperately , to link Mr. Obama’s proposal to health reform , a favorite whipping boy of Republicans that is actually working quite well:“Net Neutrality” is Obamacare for the Internet ; the Internet should not operate at the speed of government .— Senator Ted Cruz ( @ SenTedCruz ) 10 Nov 14The industry’s concerns are unfounded and self-interested . And the reaction of lawmakers like Mr. Cruz is partisan hyperbole . Mr. Obama made clear that he does not want the F.C.C . to regulate broadband as it regulates traditional telephone service even if it reclassifies it as a telecommunications service . For example , there is no reason for the commission to regulate the price of Internet service , as regulators do for traditional home phone lines .But other telecommunications rules should apply . For example , federal telephone regulations make sure that you can use your AT & T phone to call people using T-Mobile by requiring the companies to connect their networks to each other . The same should be true on the Internet – you should be able to use Netflix just as easily as you would be able to use Amazon’s streaming service .This is at the heart of what Mr. Obama is proposing:For almost a century , our law has recognized that companies who connect you to the world have special obligations not to exploit the monopoly they enjoy over access in and out of your home or business . That is why a phone call from a customer of one phone company can reliably reach a customer of a different one , and why you will not be penalized solely for calling someone who is using another provider . It is common sense that the same philosophy should guide any service that is based on the transmission of information — whether a phone call , or a packet of data .Mr. Obama’s reasoning might not satisfy phone and cable companies or their friends in Congress , who have a visceral allergic reaction to regulations . But that should not stop the F.C.C . from adopting his well-argued proposal .
David Brooks : Well , that was pretty much a complete drubbing .Gail Collins : Don’t rub it in , David .David : I guess the Republicans will pick up between eight and 10 Senate seats once the dust settles in Alaska , Virginia and Louisiana . The victories at the gubernatorial level are even more impressive . Scott Walker’s win in Wisconsin was pretty significant . The biggest surprise to me was Larry Hogan getting himself elected governor of thoroughly blue Maryland . Plus Bruce Rauner’s win as governor of Illinois was unexpected and huge . This was a national verdict .Gail : Yeah , things were even worse than I expected . The most depressing result , for me , was Sam Brownback being re-elected governor in Kansas . If you can wreck the state’s economy and not get punished at all — I don’t know what there is to say .David : It seems to me the Republican challenge is to understand what the party has done right without getting carried away by triumphalism . The Democratic challenge is to understand where the party went wrong without giving way to despair . Maybe we can talk about strengths and weaknesses ?Gail : Well , I guess that’s better than staying here under the bed , curled in a fetal position . You first .David : I guess the beginning of Republican wisdom is to understand that this was more a case of the Democrats’ losing this particular election than it was a case of the Republicans winning it . The Democrats have talked a lot about wage stagnation and income inequality but they have offered nothing compelling to address these problems . President Obama lost the House four years ago because he seemed too liberal for the country after the passage of Obamacare . He lost the Senate this year because he seemed too passive , not competent , not in control . The rollout of Obamacare was the crucial moment of his second term .Gail : I agree that the president has often seemed passive . And there’s been a lot of misspeaking for somebody who’s supposed to be a great communicator . But I don’t buy the idea that the Democrats failed to address wage stagnation and income inequality . Raise the minimum wage , create good jobs improve the nation’s roads and bridges , expand quality pre-K programs to give the next generation a boost – that’s pretty much all they talked about .David : The big Republican accomplishment is that they have detoxified their brand . Four years ago they seemed scary and extreme to a lot of people . They no longer seem that way . The wins in purple states like North Carolina , Iowa and Colorado are clear indications that the party can at least gain a hearing among swing voters . And if the G.O.P . presents a reasonable candidate ( and this year’s crop was very good ) , then Republicans can win anywhere . I think we’ve left the Sarah Palin phase and entered the Tom Cotton phase .Gail : I wouldn’t call this year’s crop very good , except in the sense that they’re definitely a less extreme group than we saw in the last few seasons . Although some – like Joni Ernst , who won the Senate seat in Iowa – are still downright scary .But the Republicans have gotten very good at teaching their candidates how to tamp down political screechiness .David : I was especially struck by Ed Gillespie’s amazing showing in Virginia . He ran one of the more policy-oriented campaigns in the country . At a time when consultants around the nation insulted voters’ intelligence with dumb campaigns , he honored their intelligence by talking about policy and was rewarded for it , win or lose . Maybe it takes a guy who has been a professional consultant to not listen to the consultants .Gail : Virginia shocked me . And Kay Hagan’s loss in North Carolina saddened me . The new Democratic South seems to exist mainly in theory .David : Scott Walker’s victory in Wisconsin is also significant . The public is clearly unhappy with public sector unions , even in a traditionally progressive place like Wisconsin . Faced with a budget crisis , a mayor or governor can take on those unions and survive and even thrive . He’ll become a compelling national figure in 2016 .Gail : Yeah , when the only unions left standing are the ones composed of people who work for the taxpayers , the labor movement is in a pretty sad shape . The Republicans have done a very good job of making it almost impossible to organize in the private sector .David : I wouldn’t give up on private sector unions . I suspect some institution will grow up to give workers more bargaining power against employers , even if it doesn’t look like the 20th-century model .Republicans should be wary of over-interpreting their mandate . Scott Brown ran hard against immigration reform and he was a rare Republican loser last night .Gail : That seemed like a weird choice of themes for New Hampshire , but maybe Brown just forgot which state he was campaigning in . I will refrain from making any jokes about how his next move will be to buy a camper and head for California , where Barbara Boxer is up for re-election in 2016 . There will always be a woman running for the Senate somewhere who he can challenge .David : I would love to see a Brown-Boxer race . Sort of a setup for a U.P.S . advertising campaign . The deeper problem for Republicans is their party still has no growth agenda . Figuring out a set of policies commensurate with the size of the structural economic issues is the next big task .Gail : See , that’s the frustrating thing . For the last two years the Senate has had Democratic committee chairs who went out of their way to work with Republicans on economic issues . But they were stonewalled by the Republican leadership . And then the voters blamed the Democratic incumbents for gridlock .David : For Democrats , I guess one big lesson is : Stop talking to each other . Democratic politicians spent the early part of the year running against the Koch brothers . That argument may scare a lot of people in liberal bastions , but no one outside of these bastions knows about them or cares .Gail : It’s totally true that politicians and the media care much more about campaign contributors than voters do I always secretly thought that if God wanted Americans to care about campaign finance reform he would have made it easier to explain . Although there was that one brief , shining moment in 2000 – John McCain . Presidential primary . New Hampshire . Amazing to think back on how that one guy in a bus just went from town meeting to town meeting talking about how to get money out of politics .Gone but not quite forgotten .David : Then the Democrats came back with the 2012 playbook — all the talk about contraception and “women’s” issues . That was tone deaf , given where the country is .Gail : I don’t agree at all . Of course you can’t give the impression that reproductive rights is the only thing you’re running on . But the real problem for the Democrats was that the Republicans figured out how to defuse the issue.Ask me about abortion and I’ll tell you that birth control pills should be sold over the counter .The Democrats aren’t going to have the luxury of running against the kind of Cro-Magnon candidates the Republicans were putting up a few years ago . Although I was tickled to see that the congressman in Florida who held the men-only gathering went down the drain . You know , the one who felt guys needed to be by themselves so they could feel free to drink , smoke and discuss serious topics .David : Democrats also need to ask themselves what it will take for them to be a congressional party once again . That means winning in places likes Arkansas , once solid Democratic states . Over the near term it means shelving theories about an emerging Democratic majority — hoping that a tide of Democratic voters will sweep the Democrats into permanent power . That still may happen over the long term , but Democrats are just terrible at appealing to white voters , especially less-educated white voters .Gail : No matter what the demographics of the future are going to look like , you obviously want candidates who can appeal to poor white and poor minority candidates at the same time . But it’s not easy to do . I don’t think the Republicans are meeting uneducated white voters’ needs . They’re just appealing to their fear of change .David : The core problem for Democrats , it seems to me , is that voters are just too skeptical of government — at least as it currently exists . Obamacare may not have been a huge issue , but Republicans ran lots of ads about it , and it remains deeply unpopular . Democrats somehow need to figure out how to offer government programs when people are innately suspicious of government as something alien and ineffective .Gail : The Republicans have done a terrific job of making their base hate government , even when they benefit greatly from government programs . And it’s ironic that President Obama , who ran as a great communicator , has been so awful at countering that message .David : The final point is that this election marks the end of the Obama presidency’s power on the domestic front . In 2008 , I would not have expected it to come to this . The verdict is still out on what Obama’s legacy will be , but it’s certainly true that he did not succeed where F.D.R. , Reagan and even Clinton did — in building a plausible majority for his party .Gail : I know that the rule of our pundit profession is that now we must turn our attention completely away from the current administration and do nothing but speculate about the presidential race in 2016 . But I want to give Obama a little more time before I declare him a goner . If he leaves behind a national health care program and a significant start to the battle against climate change , he’ll have actually accomplished much more as president than Clinton did . But I guess the nation won’t learn to appreciate him unless he’s impeached .
The politics of Obamacare are clearly starting to shift . It’s not that the public is coming to love it — not yet , anyway . But it’s less and less of a bogeyman , with polls suggesting a majority of the public against flat-out repeal . So there’s increasing pressure on Republicans to lay out an alternative — and continuing surprise about their inability to articulate one .But this is an example of why it sometimes helps , even in straight political reporting , to understand how policy works . Here’s the essential fact about health care policy , which in turn fundamentally shapes health care politics:Obamacare looks the way it does because it has to .Once again , for those who missed it : if you want to cover people with preexisting conditions , you must have community rating . If you want to have community rating without a death spiral — that is , if you want to keep an acceptable risk pool — you have to have an individual mandate . If you want to have an individual mandate , you have to have subsidies for lower-income Americans . And that’s Obamacare : a three-legged stool , with all three legs essential .Republicans can’t offer an alternative because there isn’t one ( aside , that is , from single-payer ) . Their plan , such as it was , was to wait for the plan to implode , so they would never be put on the spot ; since that isn’t happening , Plan B is to bob and weave and avoid the question until the midterms . That’s all there is .
For reference : I count at least six distinct predictions of Obamacare doom made by the usual suspects , not one of which has come true . Here they are:1 . Enrollment will be very low , and2 . Even if people sign up , they won’t pay their premiums .Reality : Signups exceeded expectations , and the vast majority paid .3 . More people will lose coverage cancelled by Obamacare than gain it .Reality : Sharp drop in the number of uninsured .4 . Rate shock .Reality : Like it says , affordable care .5 . Young people not signing up , and death spiral .Reality : Pretty good demographics .6 . Soaring health costs .Reality : Health costs are below anyone’s expectations .It’s quite an impressive track record , actually . And what’s even more impressive is that none of the usual suspects will even consider admitting having been wrong .
LEXINGTON , Ky. – Political campaigns aren’t generally associated with specificity or truth-telling and political debates are no different . But at Monday night’s debate in Lexington , both Senator Mitch McConnell and his Democratic challenger , Alison Lundergan Grimes , the Kentucky Secretary of State , reached absurd heights in the art of weasel-wording .Ms. Grimes knew the question was coming , since she’s fielded it several times in the last few days . The host of the debate , Bill Goodman , asked Ms. Grimes for whom she’d voted in the 2012 presidential election . I’ll take a wild guess here that Ms. Grimes , a Democrat who was a member of the Kentucky delegation to the Democratic National Convention two years ago , went for the Democrat : Barack Obama . But she refused to say — because she’s petrified of being linked with the president , who is deeply unpopular in Kentucky . Instead , she took umbrage on the grounds that the Kentucky constitution guarantees ballot box secrecy . She actually made the preposterous claim that by ducking the question she was standing on constitutional principle .Mr. McConnell then made her look foolish by freely sharing his votes in the 2008 and 2012 presidential contests , as well as in the 2010 Senate race , when he voted for Trey Grayson , who lost to Rand Paul , the Tea Party darling .Mr. McConnell , who’s been in Washington long enough —30 years — to know how to speak without communicating any information , had plenty of opportunity to show off his considerable obfuscation skills .Is the minimum wage a living wage , Mr. Goodman asked Mr. McConnell . “It’s an entry-level wage , ” said Mr. McConnell , hardly an answer .Is climate change real ? Before he could plead that he was “not a scientist , ” Mr. Goodman pointed out that although the senator was not an economist , he was willing to share his opinions on the economy . In a tight spot , Mr. McConnell said : “There are a bunch of scientists who feel there is a problem and maybe we can do something about it.”Lest he be accused of siding with environmentalists , he added the caveat that scientists in the 1970s thought we were moving toward an ice age , and closed by declaring that his job , as United States Senator from Kentucky , was to fight for coal jobs in the state .Mr. McConnell approached Ms. Grimes’s “ballot box secrecy”-level of absurdity when Mr. Goodman asked him if “Obamacare and Kynect” had been “a boon or bane” for the state . The difficulty for Mr. McConnell is that the Affordable Care Act is politically toxic in Kentucky , while Kynect — which is the state’s health insurance program created under the Affordable Care Act — is a runaway success .Mr. McConnell’s attempt to separate the two made no sense . The Affordable Care Act should be “pulled out root and branch.” As for Kynect , that’s just “a website . It was paid for by a grant . The website can continue.”Seeking clarity , Mr. Goodman asked if Mr. McConnell would support the continuation of Kynect . “Yeah , I think it’s fine to have a website , yeah , ” said the senator .That’s like saying that Google should cease to exist but that Google.com should live on .
Many news reports are doing their best to somehow spin the final Obamacare surge as a negative story — yes , the website did go down a couple of times due to volume , which never , ever happens to commercial sites . The narrative of Obamacare-as-failure must not be challenged !But the narrative is getting really hard to sustain . Charles Gaba:There’s the usual yammering about “But how many have PAID ? ? ? ” , “But how many were ALREADY INSURED ? ? ? ” , “How many were YOUNG ? ? ? ” and “What METAL LEVEL did they get ? ? ? ” etc etc etc . All of these are reasonable questions for actuarials , accountants and so forth to ask , and the answers will indeed help shape our understanding of what the overall economic and health status of the population at large will be .For the moment , however , none of that matters . This is an outstanding number any way you slice it .Meanwhile , via Wonkbook , a guide to “unskewing” the numbers . Yep , I blame zombie ACORN .
My Sunday column considered various possible and partial explanations for President Obama’s long year of low approval ratings , which seem likely to help cost his party control of the Senate tomorrow . The big four I considered were structural forces ( the idea that polarization and gridlock alone suffice to send most second-term presidents regressing to the low 40s ) , the essential mediocrity of our “recovered” economy , the continued unpopularity of Obamacare , and foreign policy ( where the president’s approval ratings have fallen hard ) as a kind of synecdoche for larger doubts about the administration’s basic competence . Obviously there are many more factors one could consider , but since I write about the issue frequently I thought I should explain why I didn’t include immigration , another area where the president’s approval numbers have plummeted as his administration has stumbled in various ways over the last year .My reasoning , basically , was similar to the reasoning I use when analyzing the commonplace claim that immigration is about to doom Republicans forever : I just don’t see a lot of evidence that the issue usually moves that many votes , white or Hispanic or otherwise , no matter which way it happens to be cutting at the moment . It’s true that recent events ( the child migrant surge , the White House’s strange handling of its promised amnesty , the climate of Ebola-related anxiety ) have made the politics of immigration for favorable to conservatives than they were a couple of years ago , and the failure to pass immigration reform probably contributes something to Hispanic disappointment with the president . But I still feel that immigration is ultimately more a kind of subplot within the broader categories my column proposed — one reason among many to be anxious about presidential competence , or one reason among many to blame Obama for gridlock — than an issue that deserves pride of place in analyzing the president’s weakened position .Some evidence : If you look at some recent polls on voter priorities , immigration is ( of course ) swamped by the economy , but it also tends to be cited only about half as often the national security/international affairs/terrorism nest of issues , which I think has played a much larger role in undercutting the public’s approval of the president . Likewise , if you look at this feature that maps midterm-election conversations on social media , you’ll see immigration getting significant play mostly in districts in the south and west that are already “overwhelmingly represented by Republicans , ” rather than dominating the conversation in swing states . Again , that doesn’t mean it’s an inconsequential issue , but it does make me doubt its distinctive power over the president’s ( un ) popularity and his party’s midterm fate .I could be wrong , of course . If I were inclined to play Mickey Kaus for a day and elevate immigration’s significance a little higher , it would be on the grounds that the immigration debate is an important case study in just how easily cracks can can open up within the president’s 2008/2012 majority , and how the Democratic Party’s diversity-as-strength approach to coalition-building can turn into ex uno plures in a hurry . That is , up until recently , immigration was a policy area where the president was able to successfully promise a great deal to his base without paying any kind of major price among swing voters — because what he was promising to activists ( the DREAM Act ) was pretty popular and didn’t conflict with his parallel strategy of touting deportation numbers and an allegedly-secured border , because there’s broad support for some kind of immigration compromise and most voters aren’t exactly detail-oriented , and because the G.O.P.’s consultants were terrified of contesting the issue . But once the border started to look less secure ( in part , perhaps , because of DREAM-created incentives ) and activists started demanding something much bigger ( the sweeping executive amnesty that the White House seemed poised to offer , than walked back ) , Obama’s two-step turned into something that cost him with the base and the middle … effectively undoing one of his most successful first term strategies , emboldening Republicans to criticize his policies rather than just promising compromise or ducking , and opening space between the so-called “coalition of the ascendant” and the older , whiter voters the Democrats still need to win in , say , Iowa .I think this analysis has some merit ( not surprisingly , since I just spun it ) ; I just don’t think it proves immigration’s major salience in knocking down the president’s approval ratings and/or influencing this cycle . But we’ll get an interesting test in New Hampshire , where Scott Brown has campaigned heavily on the issue ; if he pulls out an upset , my estimation of immigration’s impact on Obama’s swoon and 2014’s outcomes will go up . And whether it explains a lot or just a little of Obama’s struggles , the way the issue has played out over the last 18 months does potentially foreshadow similar/broader difficulties for the Democratic coalition as it moves into the post-Obama era , in ways that I’m sure I’ll have reason to discuss again .
You still encounter people claiming that Obamacare has been a disaster , that more people have lost insurance than gained it , etc. , etc . But the reality is that it has already made a big dent in the number of uninsured ; and the quality of insurance has gone up , too , because canceled policies were canceled because they offered little real protection .Of course , the coming of the law in January 2014 has been a big job-killer .. or maybe not:This is what success looks like .

Greg Sargent notes that the midterm election , which was supposed to be a referendum on Obamacare , isn’t looking at all like that in practice ; Republican ads denouncing health reform have been dwindling month by month .The reason is fairly obvious , although it’s not considered nice to state it bluntly : the attack on Obamacare depended almost entirely on lies , and those lies are becoming unsustainable now that the law is actually working . No , there aren’t any death panels ; no , huge numbers of Americans aren’t losing coverage or finding their health costs soaring ; no , jobs aren’t being killed in vast numbers . A few relatively affluent , healthy people are paying more for coverage ; a few high-income taxpayers are paying more in taxes ; a much larger number of Americans are getting coverage that was previously unavailable and/or unaffordable ; and most people are seeing no difference at all , except that they no longer have to fear what happens if they lose their current coverage .In other words , reform is working more or less the way it was supposed to ( except for the Medicaid expansion in non-cooperating states ) .Many of us argued all along that the right’s chance to kill reform would vanish once the program was actually in place ; the horror stories only worked as long as the truth wasn’t visible . And that’s what seems to be happening .
Gail Collins : David , I was pretty confident that the United States had Ebola under control until the other day , when it appeared policy-making had devolved to Andrew Cuomo and Chris Christie . Chris Christie , who can’t keep bridge traffic moving . Andrew Cuomo , who failed to get his 2012 flu shot until 2013 .David Brooks : This is why we’re a republic and not a democracy . People running for office should not be making science policy . By the way , I’ve been against quarantines and overreaction through this whole thing , but there was a piece in The New Republic a few weeks ago that sobered me . Steven Beutler , an infectious disease specialist , was arguing for a maximalist response . Here’s one core point : “Medicine can be a very humbling profession , and after more than 30 years of practicing infectious-disease medicine , I have learned that the ‘unanticipated’ happens all too often , especially where microbes are involved.”Gail : Do you think the Ebola hysteria will have any effect on next week’s election ? There’s been a lot of complaint about the administration’s ineptitude . But I think the message on Ebola , at least , has been the opposite . Ebola in the United States began deep in the heart of Texas , a state whose health care system is so estranged from the federal government it refuses to accept the opportunity to get its millions of uninsured residents covered under Obamacare .David : Your love of all things Texas is well known . But you have to admit a few things about the place . It is economically vibrant beyond all reckoning . Houston and Dallas are exploding economically while the rest of the country dawdles .Gail : Texas is the last gasp of the Sunbelt boom . It has all the advantages of warm weather , plus an enormous amount of space which makes housing stupendously cheap . It could have done just as well without being politically crazy .But we were talking about Ebola .David : As for Ebola and the election , my pretentious theory is that Ebola is the objective correlative of the campaign .Gail : You’re using big words again .David : If I remember high school English correctly , an “objective correlative” is an object that gives explicit access to the meaning of vague and insubstantial things , like a mood or an emotion . It’s an object that correlates to a mood or emotion or idea . T.S . Eliot made it famous writing about Hamlet .Anyway , the country was already afraid . It felt like the people running things were not quite up to the job . Along comes a disease to perfectly embody that vague sense . That said , I don’t think Ebola is swinging too many votes . People are just sour and they are disappointed with the president .Gail : It certainly has been a tough season for President Obama . But before we start blaming him for anything bad that happens next Tuesday , I would like to give him a shout-out for that hug-the-Ebola-nurse photo . Which allows us to recall that when AIDS hit the United States in 1981 , President Ronald Reagan was criminally useless . Never said a word . As Laura Helmuth noted in Slate this week , Reagan’s press secretary made fun of the idea that the president would ever consider speaking out .David : I totally agree with you on that one . It’s not in the president’s job description to be the professional emoter and behavior model , but when he can display some truth by example , he might as well do it .Gail : I know I’m preparing my defenses in advance of next week . But I think the American people have been saying they want an effective government , not a smaller government . All the candidates are promising they’re going to end gridlock , but if there’s anything we’ve learned since Obama was elected , it’s that you don’t end gridlock by sending more Tea Party types to Washington .David : I guess I think it is more generalized than that . They just don’t trust government to get the job done . At least the federal government . I’m struck by how amazingly stable polling has been on the Affordable Care Act . Democrats in swing states don’t try to defend it . They just promise to fix it . The relatively good news on the health care front over the past year has done nothing to change minds .Gail : I find it sort of fascinating that the Republican Senate nominee in Iowa , who previously said she’d support a law to have federal officials arrested for attempting to implement Obamacare , is marketing herself as the “Iowa nice” candidate who can work across the aisle .David : I find it shocking that Iowans should steal Minnesota’s slogan . Minnesota is the nice state . Missouri is the skeptical state . New Jersey is the brash state . Iowa should be the quiet state .In her defense I think it is possible to arrest federal officials nicely . We call it compassionate conservatism .Gail : O.K. , this is the point at which we’re morally obliged to start making predictions . What’s yours ?David : I say this with no great confidence , but I’m guessing the Republicans pick up eight seats . I think the biggest surprise will be a G.O.P . win in Georgia .Gail : That would make me sad , if only because Michelle Nunn has run such a good race and her opponent has been so terrible . It just seems unjust .My guess is that we’re not going to know who gets control of the Senate for a while . Some state is going to be so close there’ll be a recount . And Alaska takes forever to just get the ballots together . Plus Georgia and Louisiana , which will probably go to runoffs , since they require their senators to get a majority of the vote .David : Great ! Why shouldn’t the decade’s most content-less campaign go into overtime ? I’m sort of amazed that this election hasn’t been about jobs and the economy . It hasn’t been about anything but a sort of fatalism .Gail : There’s something about the idea of the fate of the nation hanging on Louisiana that makes me very nervous . I still remember being down there in 1991 , covering the gubernatorial runoff between the Ku Klux Klan wizard David Duke and the deeply corrupt ex-governor Edwin Edwards . The Edwards supporters had those bumper stickers saying : “Vote for the Crook.” Which , blessedly , the people did .David : I’ll take an effective crook over an ineffective honest person any day .Gail : I should mention that at age 87 , Edwards is running for the House of Representatives this year . After getting out of jail , marrying a woman 51 years younger , and starring in a reality TV series . You can’t say Louisiana isn’t interesting . And if there’s a runoff at least then we’d be able to spend part of the winter in New Orleans . So much better than next year , when we’ll be spending it in Des Moines .David : I was just in New Orleans last week . I love every street in that city except Bourbon Street , which is filled with terrible pizza places , extremely drunk idiots and teenagers mortified to be walking with their parents .Gong there makes me want to reread my favorite political novel of all time , Robert Penn Warren’s “All the King’s Men.” Trollope’s “Phineas Finn” is second .And don’t knock Des Moines . Silence is golden .Gail : What’s the state you’re following most closely ? I have to admit Kansas is pretty darned fascinating . If the Republicans have to ferry in any more old party stalwarts to shore up Senator Pat Roberts , they’ll be resurrecting Alf Landon .I got a twinge watching Bob Dole campaign so vigorously for Roberts . Do you remember in 2012 when Dole was sitting in the Senate , in his wheelchair , watching his friends refuse to ratify the United Nations treaty on people with disabilities ? Which was based , of course , on the signature bill Dole got passed in 1990 when he was in the Senate .David : Somebody should please explain to me why senators don’t ever want to retire . What’s fun about attending Ag Committee hearings when you are 84 ? Maybe the napping opportunities .Gail : I talked with Dole after the treaty vote , and he kept coming back to the fact that both of the Republican Senators from Kansas had voted against ratification . But there’s Roberts now , in a deep ditch because he took his constituents so much for granted he didn’t even bother to pretend he lived in their state . Dole clearly has a much deeper sense of loyalty .David : I once went to the Dole center in Kansas . They’ve got a sort of museum display about his life . The thing that moved me most was the exercise equipment he used to build himself back into shape after his war injury . He had wasted away to nothing and had to build himself all the way back . Then I got to see the basement where they keep all the presents he had been given by foreign dignitaries during his Senate years . There were carpets , saddles , baseball bats . People give politicians portraits of themselves . I guess that’s called knowing your subject .Gail : It’s interesting how many elections there are this year where voters seem to despise both candidates . If Floridians were any more alienated by their governor’s race , they’d have been bringing alligators to the debates .David : I don’t think Floridians should be angry or alienated . It doesn’t suit them . Among other things , it doesn’t go with their pastels .Gail : I don’t want anybody to imagine that I’m making fun of other states because of my deep satisfaction with New York . Nothing is more humbling than spending a season covering New York politics . Where the phrase “not yet indicted” is regarded as a compliment .David : If Minnesota is nice and Iowa is quiet , what should New York be : Pompous ? Narcissistic ? I say this lovingly . It is my state too .Gail : Last question . Is there anything about this election that’s really surprised you ? I didn’t expect to see so much of Mitt Romney on the campaign trail . Do you think he’s actually interested in running again ? They say third time’s a charm .David : Trust me . He isn’t running . I think his wife sort of ruled that out . That documentary released after the election revealed him to be an authentically warm and nice guy . If there are three things that don’t seem to work in politics these days it’s authenticity , niceness and warmth . Doesn’t fit the national mood .
The Kaiser Family Foundation has a new survey ( pdf ) on Obamacare in California , and it’s full of remarkably good news . For those who haven’t been following this , CA — with its now-dominant Democratic Party — is where Obamacare was implemented the way it was supposed to be implemented : the website worked pretty well from the beginning , Medicaid expansion was implemented , and the state worked hard on outreach . It was also a place that really needed reform : the uninsured were a high percentage of the population , and an individual market without community rating meant that the mere hint of a preexisting condition was enough to prevent coverage .So it now appears that most of California’s uninsured — 58 percent of the total , or well over 60 percent of those eligible ( because undocumented immigrants aren’t covered ) have gained insurance in the first year . Considering the complexity of the scheme , that’s really impressive , and it strongly suggests that next year , once those who missed out have had a chance to learn via word of mouth , California will have gotten much of the way toward universal coverage for legal residents .But there’s something else the Kaiser report drives home : most of those gaining coverage are doing so not via the exchanges ( although those are important too ) but via Medicaid . And that’s important as an answer to critics of Obamacare from the left .There have always been critics complaining that what we really should have is single-payer , and angry that subsidies were being funneled through the insurance companies . And in principle they’re right ; the trouble was that cutting the insurers out of the loop would have made the plan politically impossible , both because of the industry’s power and because of the unwillingness of people with good coverage to take a leap into a completely new system . So we got this awkward public-private hybrid , which I supported because it was what we could get and despite its impurity it dramatically improves many people’s lives .But it turns out that many of the newly insured are in fact being covered under a single-payer system — Medicaid . And as I’ve pointed out before,Medicaid is actually the piece of the US system that looks most like European health systems , which cost far less than ours while delivering comparable results .All in all , liberals really should be celebrating . California shows how Obamacare can and should work , and it’s looking pretty good .
These are tough times for opponents of health care reform . They bet everything on a debacle , but Obamacare has failed to fail — and their efforts to deny the increasingly obvious success of the law are beginning to look ridiculous .Oh , and they can’t come up with a conservative alternative ; Obamacare IS the conservative alternative , a way to achieve sorta-kinda universal coverage without single payer , and all of its main elements are essential parts of the package .So what’s left ? Claims that guaranteed health insurance is an assault on America’s freedom .Bill Gardner at The Incidental Economist offers a rather decorous , mild reply to the people making this argument . I’d put it more forcefully : the pre-ACA system drastically restricted many people’s freedom , because given the extreme dysfunctionality of the individual insurance market , they didn’t dare leave jobs ( or in some cases marriages ) that came with health insurance . Now that affordable insurance is available even if you don’t have a good job at a big company , many Americans will feel liberated — and this hugely outweighs the minor infringement on freedom caused by the requirement that people buy insurance . ( Also , if you don’t like the mandate , why not support single payer ? )But no discussion of this latest argument should fail to mention the original insurance-is-slavery campaign — Operation Coffeecup , in which the AMA recruited doctors’ wives to gather their friends and listen to a recording of Ronald Reagan declaring that Medicare would destroy American liberty .Strange to say , that didn’t happen . And Obamacare won’t turn into a form of slavery , either . On the contrary , as I said , it will be a liberating force for many Americans .

Gail Collins : David , you’ve been enthusiastic about the Senate race in Kansas , where an independent , Greg Orman , became a surprise front-runner . Now the same kind of thing seems to be happening in South Dakota . Are you excited ?David Brooks : Have you ever heard of negative panic ? In times of chaos or extreme excitement , before a fire or an oncoming tornado , some people act with extreme calm , as if everything is normal . Their brains just don’t know how to handle the extreme circumstances so they pretend those circumstances don’t exist . Many people die because they don’t take the simple evasive action that would save their lives .I am so excited by the prospect of an independent candidate in South Dakota that I am behaving as if everything is normal . I give off the appearance of extreme calm . But deep down I’m rippling with excitement . Next to me John Thune and Tom Daschle seem manic .Gail : I may have gotten carried away . I remember now that I recently humiliated myself by announcing how thrilled I was by a Senate candidate debate in Iowa .But we’ve only got three more weeks of this election season , so you have to humor me . In South Dakota , Mike Rounds , the Republican Senate candidate , was supposed to win . Then he got mired in a scandal . It’s one of those extremely complicated matters that we in the media try to summarize with a phrase like “allegations of corruption.”David : Do you know that South Dakota was the last state among the 48 that I have visited ? Now I’ve been there a few times . What impresses me about the place is that the eastern and western sides of the state are rivals with each other . You’d think that there would be so much resentment north/south in the Dakotas that they wouldn’t have time for east/west . I guess the winters are long .I don’t know why I mention this except that I think people would be more forgiving toward Mike Rounds if there was more of a love-thy-neighbor mentality .Gail : Well , Rounds hasn’t run any attack ads because he feels South Dakotans don’t like that tone . Although to be fair , until recently he didn’t think he had any competition . People who are basically running unopposed love the high road .The Democrat , Rick Weiland , has been running as a populist-liberal , and until recently the national party rewarded him for his principled candidacy by ignoring his race entirely . Then Larry Pressler , a former Republican senator now turned independent , began to get traction . Now anything seems possible .David : I love the fact that Pressler is back , once again disproving the most untrue truism in American literature , that there are no second acts in American life .Gail : Oh my gosh , I totally agree with you . Bill Clinton alone has had about fifteen second acts .David : Pressler is on his seventh or eighth act . The guy was a Rhodes Scholar , a Vietnam vet . He first entered Congress before Jimmy Carter was president . That’s a long time ago . He was also the senator who came off looking good during the Abscam scandal . Here’s a passage from a 1980 Washington Post story:“Thanks to the F.B.I.’s undercover ‘sting’ operation , there now exists incontrovertible evidence that one senator would not be bought . Preserved among the videotape footage that may be used as bribery evidence against a number of members of Congress , there is a special moment in which Sen. Larry Pressler ( R-SD ) tells the undercover agents , in effect , to take their sting and stick it . Pressler , according to law enforcement sources , was the one approached member of Congress who flatly refused to consider financial favors in exchange for legislative favors , as suggested by undercover agents posing as Arabs . At the time he said he was not aware that he was doing anything quite so heroic.”Gail : I do love listening to you read the news . And you brought back Abscam ! It’s comforting , at minimum , to know there was at least one senator who didn’t immediately buy the phony-sheikh hustle .David : So yes , I guess I have a soft spot for a guy like that who wants to re-enter the Senate . That said , I think it will be hard to stay up in the polls once the other guys set their sights on him .Gail : So we agree South Dakota is – yes ! – exciting . And I know you like the idea of electing bipartisan independents .Here’s what worries me about that . There are already two official independents in the Senate , Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine . Suppose we wound up with a Senate that was 48-48-4 ? If the independents formed their own little caucus , they’d have the deciding votes on everything . The fate of every bill and nomination would depend on four guys from Kansas , South Dakota , Vermont and Maine . Four people whose states represent less than 2 percent of the American population .David : Are you worried about this because the United States Senate is not a model of legislative excellence ? I of course think the Senate is way more polarized than the country so it would be a good thing to have a little ballast in the center . Even if that ballast does come from extremely even-tempered states .Gail : Do you think South Dakotans will be troubled by the fact that the independent Senate candidate Larry Pressler seems to actually live in Washington , D.C ? At least he rents an apartment in Sioux Falls , which is more than Pat Roberts , the endangered Kansas senator , bothered to do .David : I wished all senators lived in D.C. Congress worked better when its members couldn’t fly home every week . I don’t think it’s the time at home that ruins them ; it’s the airport food .I know people like me are always saying this , but I do think if members of the Senate were here for more than three days at a stretch they would actually learn to like each other a little more . Plus , members of Congress are not primarily in office to directly represent their constituents ; they are in Congress to offer their best judgments on the issues of the day .Gail : Well , sort of . Until the budget or the farm bill comes out , and everybody’s trying to figure out what it means to the folks in East Cupcake .We do have a lot of close races that are roiled by residency issues this year . Besides South Dakota and Kansas , there’s Louisiana , where Senator Mary Landrieu’s official state residence is in her parents’ house . And in Alaska , the Republican Senate candidate is getting criticized for having what might be called shallow Alaskan roots .David : We’ve got to start paying these people more . With Washington real estate prices shooting toward N.Y.C . levels , it’s expensive to maintain a home there and a house back in the home state . I really think this residency business is a crazy issue .Gail : Maybe we could put up dorms . Nice big ones like colleges have for married graduate students .This is the point at which I get nostalgic and recall that in one of the first elections I ever covered , one of the big issues was whether the voting address of the incumbent was actually a North Haven , Connecticut , Burger King outlet .David : I didn’t know Chris Christie began his career in Connecticut .Gail : Ach , low blow .But it still seems to me that people are better off choosing between two parties that have reasonably clear , competing agendas — plus the ability , at least in theory , to deliver on some of their promises .David : If one party or another had a total grip on the truth I’d agree with you . Hard issues usually require a balancing between competing values and competing legitimate interests . Independents , if they know their job , can help find this balance . If they don’t know their job they just waffle in the middle .Gail : Well , I do admit that the last several seasons in Washington have not done a whole lot for my let-the-parties-deliver theory .David : So true .Gail : Maybe the good news from this election season is that Obamacare is fading as an issue . Can you foresee a time when the House will give up voting several dozen times a season to repeal it and actually start working with the other party to fix its weak spots ?I don’t want to force your opinion , but maybe I should point out that there are a lot of us who would grab onto a positive response as a tiny glimmer of hope in an otherwise hopeless election season .David : Sorry . I do think health care inflation is declining , which is fabulous news , either because of Obamacare or some other reason . But I’m afraid this issue will be with us forever . When Larry Pressler stages his next comeback in 2056 , we’ll still be talking about it .
Whenever Barack Obama seems in danger of falling , do we have to hear that George W. Bush made the cliff ?It happened with the economy . For the president’s staunchest defenders , legitimate questions about whether the stimulus was wisely crafted and whether Obamacare was rushed took a back seat to lamentations over the damage that his predecessor had done . Obama wasn’t perfect , but at least he wasn’t Bush .And with the Middle East , those defenders sometimes turn Bush’s epic mistakes into Obama’s hall pass . Perhaps he hasn’t figured out what’s right , but he isn’t guilty of the original wrong , which is constantly being litigated anew , as if a fresh verdict on the events of 2003 could alter the challenges and stakes of 2014 .On Tuesday there was another spasm of this . As Congress debated the escalation of airstrikes against Islamic extremists , Representative Lloyd Doggett , a Texas Democrat , digressed to inveigh against “the wholly unnecessary Bush-Cheney invasion of Iraq , ” a bell that was rung 11 1/2 years ago and can’t be un-rung now .And to judge from my inbox lately and the chatter I overhear , what matters to many of Obama’s most stalwart fans isn’t whether he erred in the way he spoke of those extremists , turned his attention to them quickly enough or is now confronting them with the correct dose of belligerence : not too little , not too much .At least he’s not Bush . He didn’t hallucinate weapons of mass destruction , make a spurious case for war or condone torture . I hear so much about Bush’s failings and Bush’s sins that you’d think he were still huddled over a desk in Washington rather than dabbing at a canvas in Texas .Enough . It’s true that Obama hasn’t replicated Bush’s offenses , and it’s consoling . But it isn’t exactly reason for a parade , and it doesn’t inoculate him . The culpability that lies elsewhere doesn’t relieve the responsibilities that are now his .And not being as bad as someone else is hardly the same as being good . Obama can rise far above Bush and still fall short . The presidency isn’t “The Voice” ( though it is a little like “Survivor” ) . You’re not judged only in relation to the other performers who’ve been on stage . You’re judged by how well you respond to the unique circumstances of your time and place — by your ability to clean up the mess , not whether you made it .This not-as-bad-as defense is a pointless partisan tic . We’ve seen a lot of it over the course of this presidency and will no doubt see a lot of it during the next , be it Democratic or Republican .The I.R.S . scandal was not as bad as Watergate . ( Nothing’s ever as bad as Watergate , which serves a nifty historical function as the gold standard of executive malfeasance and mendacity . )The bungled rollout of Obamacare was not as bad as the botched response to Katrina .It’s apples and hurricanes , but they’re put in the same basket , in a manner that recalls a child trying to evade punishment by ratting out a sibling for something worse . Don’t be mad , Mommy , about Operation Fast and Furious and all those guns that ended up with Mexican drug cartels . Ronnie traded arms for hostages as part of this whole Iran-contra affair !I sometimes like to imagine presidential campaigns waged along these lines and what the candidates’ not-as-bad-as bumper stickers might say .“Fewer Lies Than Nixon.” “Fewer Sweaters Than Carter.” “Fewer Interns Than Clinton.” “Better Speller Than Quayle.”It works in the other direction , too , and Obama has definitely suffered plenty of not-as-good-as slings . Former presidents are held up not merely as yardsticks ; they’re rulers used to rap the knuckles of the Oval Office’s current inhabitant and beat him over the head .Smack : That Teddy Roosevelt certainly understood the power of the bully pulpit ! Thwack : That L.B.J . really knew how to schmooze ! A president is like a second spouse living in the saintly shadow of a first one who perished too soon .George Santayana famously said that those who don’t know history are destined to repeat it . But are those who fixate on it blind to how peculiar the present is , and to the fact that no degree of longing for a lost hero or blaming of a departed villain is going to change what lies ahead ?If we’re determined to glance back at a figure who flatters Obama , let’s really have at it and look all the way to Warren Harding . Golf wasn’t his only distraction . He also had a thing for poker . And when it came to seeming and feeling overwhelmed , the 29th president , an Ohio Republican , reputedly confessed to friends that he was lost in the job .By that measure Obama is a rock . But it doesn’t make him a boulder .
On Monday , I wrote that the apparent stabilization of Obamacare sharpens the political and policy challenge facing the law’s critics . Instead of the sort of easy unraveling that some Republicans had convinced themselves was in the offing , I argued ( in a point made rather more forcefully by Ramesh Ponnuru ) that it’s now much more likely that the only way the things conservatives dislike about Obamacare will ever change or go away is if conservatives actually unite around reforms or a replacement that sustains some of the current law’s coverage expansion ( albeit on significantly different terms ) .My sense is that some Republicans half-agree . That is , they’re willing to concede that the party needs an Obamacare replacement that’s more serious than some of the G.O.P.’s circa-2009 alternatives . But they also think the law will remain so unpopular , and that the number of losers will exceed the number of winners so dramatically , that conservative policymakers will have more room to maneuver , in terms of the initial coverage numbers a replacement might sustain , than my reading of the situation would suggest .The health care reform proposal rolled out by Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal this week offers a specific example of how this perspective cashes out . Unlike some other recent Republican proposals ( most notably , the bill co-sponsored in the Senate earlier this year ) , which promise tax cuts and savings relative to current policy , Jindal’s proposal explicitly starts with the 2008 baseline , and promises not to tax or spend a dollar more . His proposed reform would convert the open-ended deduction for employer-provided insurance into a flat deduction , extend the same deduction to people outside the employer market , and channel $ 100 billion over ten years to the states to provide for high-risk pools and other measures to help cover people with pre-existing conditions . What it conspicuously wouldn’t do is create the kind of tax credit for catastrophic coverage that you’ll often find in right-of-center health care alternatives — because that would cost money relative to the 2008 baseline , and/or require further disruptions elsewhere in the system . Which means , in turn , that if you replaced Obamacare with Jindalcare in 2017 , you’d see a coverage expansion relative to the Bush era , but a large number of the newly-insured would lose coverage without any immediate prospect of regaining it .Jindal was in D.C. yesterday to talk about his plan ( full disclosure , I was there ) , and the Washington Examiner’s Philip Klein has a good write-up of how he responded to , shall we say , pushback on this point:Jindal was pressed on why he chose to offer a tax deduction for individuals to purchase insurance rather than a refundable tax credit . Supporters of the tax credit approach argue that it would benefit more people , because lower-income Americans don’t pay enough taxes for the deduction to be valuable enough to make insurance premiums affordable .He said that he decided on the deduction approach because relying on tax credits would be so costly that it would require tax increases – and Jindal doesn’t want his plan to spend more or tax more than the system that existed prior to Obamacare’s passage . He also argued that credits would cause more disruption to the employer-based market and would be more prone to fraud .He said that whatever amounts of money conservatives were willing to allocate to address a problem , Democrats would always be willing to spend more , so conservatives can not get into a bidding war .Jindal cited previous estimates of similar reform proposals to his own , which he said could reduce family health insurance premiums by $ 5,000 annually and increase coverage by 9 million people relative to the number of people who were covered prior to Obamacare .“I don’t think conservative health care reform is about saying we’re going to compete with them in terms of how many people we say have an insurance card , ” he said . “That’s not the ultimate goal.”So obviously the governor and I have a substantive disagreement here : Like Jindal , I’m deeply skeptical of the “give everyone a Medicaid card” approach to health care reform , but that skepticism pushes me toward supporting a basic catastrophic protection ( and other reforms ) instead , rather than toward just accepting , for the foreseeable future , a health insurance marketplace that prices a lot of working class Americans out of affordable coverage of any sort .But for the purposes of this post , I’m more interested in the politics of the debate . Politically , I don’t think there’s any question that Jindal’s argument — go back to the pre-Obamacare baseline , expand coverage modestly relative to that — would play well with at least part of the G.O.P . electorate in a primary campaign . For a case , contra myself and Ponnuru , that it could also play pretty well in the general election and in a subsequent legislative battle , here’s Ben Domenech , writing in yesterday’s edition of his newsletter The Transom:… when President Obama sold his health care law to the American people , he sold it to them primarily on the basis of cost . He did this because the polling was so unanimous : people weren’t demanding massive increased regulation of the insurance marketplace to achieve any particular moral goal about coverage levels or anything of the sort – the vast majority of Americans just cared that their premiums cost too much . So Obama made the case for his law based not on increasing coverage , but on decreasing costs – and along the way , he promised that no one would lose their doctor , their plan , or see worse coverage because of his law . In each case , his case was in line with the polling data on what the American people wanted .But what about making the case for health policy reforms in the post-Obamacare era ? For most center-right health policy experts and opinion-makers , the assumption has taken hold that coverage levels must be sustained or even increased under any comparable reform . They believe the argument in favor of universal coverage has been lost , and that any plan which kicks people off of an entitlement program is doomed to fail , politically .This is an assumption held by most people in Washington and the media . But I wonder how accurate it is . Post-Obamacare polling data on this question is lacking , but given the behavior of so many individuals and entities in reaction to Obamacare it’s possible that the bulk of Americans still hold the same views they did prior to the law’s passage : that they want to retain their current plans , that they dislike disruption in their insurance experience , but that most of all , they want lower costs for themselves , not broader coverage for everybody else .I agree that support for universal coverage has tended to be soft , rising when it seems theoretical and then diminishing when the trade-offs actually present themselves . But my expectation is that with Obamacare in place , the psychology of loss aversion changes this calculus in two ways . First , indirectly — because it seems worse to most people to lose a benefit than to have never enjoyed it , voters will feel more morally uncomfortable supporting a candidate who promises to strip other people’s coverage than they would have felt voting for a candidate who opposed the expansion originally . And second , directly — because over the next few years , even voters who dislike Obamacare and aren’t getting subsidies are likely to internalize the idea that they now have an additional backstop in the event of job-loss or illness , and so voting to roll the program back completely and start afresh without that backstop will , again , be more unpopular than never creating it in the first place would have been . ( The consistent presence , in most polls , of an anti-Obamacare demographic that prefer changes to outright repeal suggests to me that the idea of maintaining some kind of quasi-universal guarantee has relatively strong appeal . )I’d also make a broader point : Yes , the health care law remains unpopular , but it was unpopular in 2012 as well , and the economy was worse , and the Republican nominee still went down to defeat — not least , I would submit , because of the perception that he couldn’t be trusted to safeguards the interests of the non-rich . So even if people generally care more about cost than coverage , it still seems quite likely that this fatal impression of the party’s priorities would be accentuated , rather than diminished , in a 2016 campaign where the Republican nominee would be quite directly promising to drive the uninsured rate up .My expectation could be confounded , I concede , if the next few years are a true disaster of spiking premiums and stagnant newly-insured numbers . And I would certainly agree with Domenech that the structure of the law is a lot more vulnerable than exuberant liberals seem to think this week .But I also think that in political terms , it’s actually slightly crazy for Republicans to bet this way given the other options available to them . The Jindal theory , that the right shouldn’t bother competing with liberals on certain policy fronts because they’ll always be outbid , is generally problematic ( why does his proposal have any coverage expansion , then ? ) but it’s a particularly odd idea to embrace in a case where the liberal program may not , as even its defenders allow , actually end up delivering the scale of coverage expansion that was expected .By which I mean that if the current enrollment trends persist , there is a good chance that some version of a more catastrophic-focused reform could actually enroll somewhat more Americans in some kind of basic coverage than Obamacare , at a substantially lower cost . ( A preliminary private score of the Senate Republican bill suggested it could get slightly higher coverage numbers , and that was — I believe — using the C.B.O . projections for Obamacare , which may turn out to have been too high . ) Which in turn would offer Republicans an opportunity to effectively outbid the Democrats on enrollment while significantly underbidding them on spending . ( The Democrats could , of course , counter with single-payer — but the G.O.P . should want to provoke that debate ! ) And to pass up that unusual opportunity in favor of a probably-doomed fidelity to a nearly decade-old baseline … well , I suppose it would be very much like the Republican Party I’ve come to know and love so well .
As we await an official presidential response to last night’s Democratic debacle , here are two quotes that seem likely to frame the political class’s discussion of how the president might respond . First , from Politico , days before the drubbing , when the White House could still hope for just a modest setback at the polls:Administration officials tell us that Obama’s political and policy teams are planning a big counterattack if the Republicans win the Senate—introducing a slate of legislative proposals and executive actions on immigration , infrastructure and early childhood education that are popular with the Democratic base and that he will dare the GOP to oppose .And second , from an anonymous Dem bigwig talking to Business Insider last night:
I love voting . I love pretty much everything about it . My polling place is and has been for many years the Alfred E. Smith School , P.S . 163 , an elementary school . The voting booths are arrayed around a mottled , parquet gym floor , and there are always mothers running a bake sale outside to raise money for the school .Up until a few years ago , we voted on huge , metal machines that seemed like relics from the first days of the industrial age . Exercising the franchise was a pleasing combination of sacred civic ritual and theatricality . You waited in line , gave your name , signed the voting rolls , then were ushered behind a curtain that you closed by slamming a red-handled lever big enough to have served as a prop in “Modern Times” to one side . You flicked more mechanical switches to choose your candidates behind the curtain — a rare oasis of total privacy out in public Manhattan . You could even change your mind and flip them back , at least until the end , when you gave the lever a satisfying slam back the other way , and the curtain slid open . You half-expected the Wizard of Oz to appear .Now that was casting a vote !That’s all changed , thanks to our supposed concern about voter fraud . Since New York instituted its new , computerized voting system , the way things work are as follows : We line up to give our names and get a ballot . We then go a second line for the next available , barely private voting “booth” — in reality a table with a sort of sneeze guard around three sides . When we’re finished , we line up a third time to run our ballots through the next available computer , which assures us that our votes have been registered as we wanted , although who can possibly say . Knowing how protected vital American computer systems are against hackers , I’m waiting for the Election Day the screen tells me my candidate is stuck in Nigeria , and desperately needs a money order to get home and take office .The whole process not only takes three lines — something New Yorkers just love — and is barely private . Volunteers at the polls can easily see whom you voted for at the computers , and often must run the ballots through the scanners for the more elderly or infirm voters . So much for the sanctity of the ballot . The bake sales are still great , though .The lines were fairly sparse at the Smith school today , which inevitably led me to think back to the very long lines and the wild enthusiasm that imbued our first opportunity to vote for Barack Obama for president , in 2008 .“All politics is national” now , which made this midterm election yet another referendum on President Obama , and it has turned out to be another overwhelming repudiation of the president , who already suffered one debacle back in 2010 .This appears to have been a baffling rejection to this supremely detached president , whose supporters have been protesting that the public just does not appreciate all he has done — a list that invariably includes Obamacare , a revived stock market and an unemployment mark that has inched slowly downward .What the White House doesn’t seem to appreciate is just how little a dent this has made in the devastating loss of wealth , security and opportunity so many Americans have experienced in the last few years . But this administration has also been afflicted almost from the start with the inability to decide just whom it is trying to appeal to .Like Bill Clinton before him , this New Democrat president early on dismissed traditional liberals as “professional leftists” as his first press secretary once put it . But just a few months ago he also let his new F.C.C . chairman suggest an end to net neutrality , and his secretary of education heartily endorse the decision of a Republican judge ending teacher tenure , in which said judge claimed “there are a significant number of grossly ineffective teachers currently active in California classrooms.”Well , which is it ? Are you trying to build the new , white-collar Democratic Party or not , and if so , where do you expect these people to come from ?This sort of confusion about practical politics has long bedeviled New Democrats . And in fairness , we did let the president down , after that cool , cool fall day in 2008 . The sorts of sweeping , groundbreaking reforms we were hoping for — the change we could believe in — has never been accomplished from the top down in America , but has always meant a president gathering up the strands of many useful ideas and experiments , and working with the power , and often the hands , feet , elbows and knees , of grass-roots movements at his back .Franklin D. Roosevelt’s leading advisers , Harry L. Hopkins , Frances Perkins , Harold L. Ickes and Henry A. Wallace , among others , had labored long in the trenches on crucial issues of social welfare , labor rights , and land and farm preservation . The Tennessee Valley Authority came out of a decades-long struggle for public power , by Senator George W. Norris . No one in the Congress or Mr. Obama’s cabinet has provided anything like this sort of counsel , or experience .Nor has there been anything like the sorts of longstanding , populist , militant farm and labor movements that put the New Deal over . In the turmoil of the 1930s , worker uprisings literally took over waterfronts , factories , department stores and even the city of Minneapolis . Occupy Wall Street took over Zuccotti Park , then evaporated . It takes more than that — more than casting a vote every couple of years — to make change .
Gail Collins : David , it’s less than five weeks until Election Day . And people are so — um — how would you characterize the mood ?David Brooks : Let’s see . Giddy with disinterest . Tingling with unconscious ennui . Quivering with apathy . I’d say the public mood is paradoxical .Gail : Yet control of the Senate hangs in the balance ! And it’s all up to the voters in five to 10 states , which neither you nor I inhabit .David : I’m really glad to have been spared the agony of swing state envy . I’ve never lived in any state that isn’t solidly blue . So I’ve never known what it feels like to live in a place that has the excitement of competitive races . Hence I don’t feel the lack when that excitement goes away . You , coming from Ohio , are not so fortunate . Do you feel pain , perhaps in your wrists and other joints , watching faraway states get all the attention now that you live in a state of political indifference ? Swing state envy is like a concussion , not to be underestimated . I think I may start wearing a purple wrist-band as a sympathy statement .Gail : Our big New York news was that Gov . Andrew Cuomo , who’s up for re-election , found it necessary to go to Afghanistan this week . He sort of spun it as an effort to learn more about homeland security . But I honestly think you can do that in the homeland .David : I’m presuming this was not a hiking the Appalachian Trail sort of thing . Maybe he went to curry favor with the Pashtun population in Rye . Or for the golfing .Gail : Meanwhile his opponent , whose name recognition is limited to his immediate family , reprised that old Lyndon Johnson “Daisy” ad where the little girl is picking petals off a flower and then suddenly – countdown to Armageddon ! In this version , when the nuclear bomb goes off , Andrew Cuomo’s face comes out of the cloud .Did not expect an ad about atomic warfare in the New York gubernatorial race . Possible high point of the political week for me . How about you ? I know you’ve been taking the occasional gander at the big Senate races . What strikes you as interesting ?David : First the money . There’s been a ton of it , more than $ 228 million by outside groups alone so far . But the surprise in this post-Citizens-United era is that the Democrats are winning the money race so easily . I knew that the Democrats were the party of the rich plutocrats , but I didn’t realize how big the lead was . In North Carolina , pro-Democratic groups have a spending lead , $ 13 million to $ 8 million . In Iowa , the Democrats lead $ 9 million to $ 6 million . In Colorado , Democrats lead $ 10 million to $ 5 million . And so on in most states . If this continues Democrats are going to start loving that decision .Gail : I hope it keeps going like this . I’d love to watch Mitch McConnell and John Boehner demand that we do something about the poison of “super PACs.”Meanwhile , on the issues front , I’ve been fascinated by how much Republicans have come to love contraception . Really , if they get any more enthusiastic they’re going to start passing out condoms at the debates .David : Or wearing them on their heads like Howie Mandel .Gail : I’ve heard several Republican Senate candidates announce that they wanted to see birth control pills sold over the counter . This usually starts with a question about Obamacare – and the requirement that employers cover contraceptives in their health insurance plans . Then the Republican says that if birth control pills were sold like aspirin or Tums , they’d be much cheaper . Which may be true , although having them paid for by your insurance is certainly a better deal .David : That’s clearly true . I’m struck , though , by how much the Democrats’ war-on-women charge against the G.O.P . doesn’t seem to be working . In the last Times poll , women were split down the middle , supporting Republicans almost as much as Democrats , 42-43 .Gail : They were still more Democratic-leaning than men . And I do think it’s working in some races , particularly the ones where the Republican candidate supported the personhood amendment . You know , the one that declares all fertilized eggs have the full rights of a human being .That came up in the Iowa Senate debate , which I am slightly embarrassed to admit I watched from beginning to end .David : Wow . You do have swing state envy . Are you listening to reports on corn prices too ?Gail : Iowa debates are always worthwhile . I enjoy the moment when the fiscal conservative calls for less federal spending , and then is forced to make it clear that underwriting the manufacture of corn-based ethanol does not count as wasteful .David : My problem with the ethanol subsidies is purely selfish . You used to be able to drive around Iowa and see some crop diversity . Now it’s corn , corn , corn . I bet that even the field of dreams is covered with corn . It’s tedious .Gail : There’s been a growing attempt on the part of Republicans to bring ISIS into the campaign . Most of the ads I’ve seen don’t have a coherent theme . It’s like , “When terrorists were beheading Americans in Syria , Senator X supported the Obama administration and also missed a public hearing of the Veterans Affairs Committee.”David : I’m just glad to see any foreign policy in this election . We should have at least some form of national debate on ISIS . I guess this is also a Republican effort to nationalize the election . As observers like Sean Trende have noted , earlier in the campaign there was a disjunction between the fundamentals and the polls . The fundamentals — the president’s low approval ratings — suggest this should be a big Republican year . But the polls were much closer . Many Democratic candidates were hanging in there , even in states Romney carried . Over the past month the polls have moved slightly toward the fundamentals — that is in a slightly Republican direction .Gail : People are so angry at Barack Obama . Their ire seems to be mainly about the economy , yet compared to many other countries , the United States is doing pretty well economically . I’m happy to accept the theory that people are angry because of income inequality and the struggling middle class . But the solution to that wouldn’t be electing a Congress that’s determined to cut federal spending . You’d just wind up with more laid-off state employees , highway construction workers , even schoolteachers .Want to explain that to me ?David : It’s possible that people don’t think they’re getting their money’s worth . It could be they’re not crazy about boondoggles like ethanol or gubernatorial trips to Afghanistan . It’s possible that they think they could spend money more wisely than Congress does . Can’t imagine how they could leap to that conclusion .Gail : Well , that’s Congress . But they’re trying to make it all about the president . I’m expecting that Georgia voters will soon be seeing ads in which Michelle Nunn’s picture morphs into Barack Obama .David : What strikes me about this is that the movement is similar across many races , suggesting that there is a national dynamic in place . That makes sense . Over the past five midterms we’ve pretty much seen national dynamics in place most of the time . There was a wave for one party or another . This year that should favor Republicans , who are trying to build the election around national issues , not local candidates .Gail : Do you think these elections matter ? There’s a lot of sentiment that they don’t – that if the Republicans take over the Senate , there’ll be the same stalemate we’ve got now . That it might even make it easier for the Democrats in 2016 , because there’ll still be gridlock and the Republicans will be more clearly to blame .David : I’m simple-minded . I think winning is better than losing . Remember , once an incumbent gets in , he or she is likely to stay there for a long time . I don’t think Democrats should be pre-rationalizing this year’s results .Gail : Me neither . Although it would be pretty interesting if the Republicans won control of the Senate , and we got to spend two years watching them complain about the evils of the filibuster .David : I can’t imagine much legislation will be passed either way . After Obamacare , which was signed into law in March of 2010 , I can’t think of a major piece of legislation that has passed in any of the last four years , and I suppose we’ll go another two in the same stagnation .Gail : You must be forgetting the Responsible Helium Administration and Stewardship Act .But about these elections – I admit that I am jealous of the big swing states . If I was in Iowa or Alaska or North Carolina , I’d be obsessed with the senate race . I’d talk about it all the time , and people would run away when they saw me coming .David : You’ve got it bad .Gail : Here in New York , everything’s pretty much preordained . Except in Staten Island , where the Republican congressman who threatened to throw a TV reporter over a Capitol balcony might be in trouble .David : Is that because TV reporters are so light ? Throwing a print reporter would be way more impressive .Gail : Well , he failed to follow through . Maybe his constituents are irked that he was all show and no throw . But he’s also under multiple indictments for perjury and tax evasion . And yet his defeat is not a foregone conclusion .David : I’d think a perjury record would be a plus . Practice makes perfect .
Over at Talking Points Memo , they seem bemused by the violent reaction on the right to any suggestion that Obamacare is working as well as all the evidence suggests it is . Josh Marshall and Ezra Klein both made a fairly obvious point : Kathleen Sebelius’s resignation was almost surely timed to follow good news , so that her departure wouldn’t be easy to spin as part of a narrative about failed reform . The right , however , went ballistic — not so much expressing skepticism over the good enrollment numbers and the encouraging survey data as expressing total outrage and bewilderment that anyone believes the good news . On the right they know , just know , that it’s a total disaster .What’s interesting about this is that conservative health wonks , however much they may like to spin facts , know better : even on the right , everyone who knows anything about the subject has been telling people not to expect a collapse , a death spiral , whatever , and even suggesting that Republicans may need to accept that much of Obamacare is irreversible . But not many people in that camp read , say , Avik Roy ; they’re getting their information from Fox News and Rush , and they hear nothing but tales of disaster .But why would they place so much faith in these sources ? These are , after all , the same sources that told them that Romney was going to win big , that we were headed for hyperinflation , and much much more . How can such experiences not have instilled at least a bit of doubt ?Well , we basically know the answer . One thing I learned from reporting on the Madoff affair was the term “affinity fraud” : people are easily duped by con men who seem to be like them , to be their kind of people . What Fox , Rush etc . do is build a cultural and emotional bond with their audiences , based mainly on who they dislike and attack . And that bond induces those audiences to believe that what comes from these sources is the obvious truth , never mind what those arrogant elitists with their “facts” and “data” may be saying . ( I’m turning into Stephen Colbert as we speak . )Anyway , it’s quite a sight to behold .
Three blog posts and a column should probably suffice to cover the debate over Obamacare and work incentives , but I don’t want to let the topic drop without first stepping back and talking about the actual health policy disagreement here . My column and posts last week criticized what struck me as a kind of insouciance from liberals about this issue , shading into a post-work utopianism that doesn’t wrestle with what , in practice , the decline of work is actually likely to mean for issues of class , mobility , and social equality . But it’s also important to recognize that for many liberal writers , the controlling assumption here is not anti-work or pro-work . It’s just pro-universal health care as a basic standard for a decent society , with the consequences taken as they come .I would prefer that this perspective was accompanied by less chatter about how the only people working less because of Obamacare will be The Most Hardworking Amazing Moms in America , and fewer suggestions that it’s indecent and unpatriotic to worry about how welfare policy influences economic decision-making . But stripped of the Panglossian window dressing , it’s entirely reasonable to believe that some public goods are too important to be withheld just because they might have a few perverse consequences . ( I can certainly think of a few policies I would support even if they took a bite out workforce participation . )At least where the center-left is concerned , then , if you dig deep enough into the work-incentives debate you’ll hit the same old argument about the importance of universal comprehensive insurance . That’s why you keep seeing Obamacare’s defenders argue that the law’s income effect — where people work less because they’re getting insurance benefits at a much-reduced cost — is mostly fine , because we don’t want people having to work to afford a basic good like health insurance . And it’s why , when they talk about the substitution effect — the way the the subsidy phase-out creates an effective marginal tax that discourages working longer hours or taking a higher-paying job — they usually concede the existence of a problem , but then argue that the best way to solve it would be to extend Obamacare’s existing benefit further up the income ladder , or make it universal … in each case , at an expense that conservatives would inevitably oppose .What’s being implicitly ruled out , in both cases , is the possibility that government should be subsidizing insurance , but also subsidizing less of it than Obamacare does , and that the scope of the existing insurance model is making both the income and the substitution effects larger than they need to be . This is basically the theory behind the most plausible conservative alternative — a flat subsidy for catastrophic coverage — to the health care law we actually got . And though liberals mostly reject it , I think it’s a theory worth entertaining even if you believe absolutely in the kind of redistribution inherent in Obamacare … because even granted the pro-redistribution premise it’s still not obvious that subsidizing comprehensive insurance is the best way to go about it .Think about it this way . The welfare state delivers a basket of subsidies to lower-income Americans . Some of these subsidies take the form of cash , and some are direct subsidies for various goods ( food , housing , health insurance ) . Some are tied to work — the earned income tax credit is the notable example — and some of them are not . Pre-Obamacare , the main subsidy for health insurance was tied to work , which both conservatives and liberals tend to regard as a less-than-ideal design ; it was also open-ended and regressive , making it a lousy deal for low-income Americans , period .So we can agree that we should be transitioning away from that model . But there’s no necessary reason why , in the course of that transition , we should just set the new “health care” share of the low-income basket at the levels suggested by the existing insurance model , when that model plainly isn’t delivering value for those dollars overall . Maybe , instead , it would make more sense to take some of the money that Obamacare spends chasing the goal of comprehensive coverage and spend it , say , on giving single workers some of the same E.I.T.C . benefits as families . Or on a larger child tax credit . Or on a straightforward payroll tax cut . Or — to pick a liberal cause , instead of a reform conservative idea — new experiments in universal pre-kindergarten !If severing health insurance from work inevitably reduces workforce participation , that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t gradually sever it , and seek to subsidize insurance in a different way . But it means that we should think seriously about what else we should be doing , and whether we should be spending as much as Obamacare spends on insurance when there are other transfers that might not offer as many work disincentives , might give a stronger boost to upward mobility , and might do more long-term good .On the last point , I don’t want to rehearse the entire debate about catastrophic versus comprehensive coverage , and the good that health insurance does or doesn’t do . I’ll just note two recent items that I think are relevant to this debate . The first is a big Times story , running today:One of the largest and most meticulous studies of mammography ever done , involving 90,000 women and lasting a quarter-century , has added powerful new doubts about the value of the screening test for women of any age .It found that the death rates from breast cancer and from all causes were the same in women who got mammograms and those who did not . And the screening had harms : One in five cancers found with mammography and treated was not a threat to the woman’s health and did not need treatment such as chemotherapy , surgery or radiation .The study , published Tuesday in The British Medical Journal , is one of the few rigorous evaluations of mammograms conducted in the modern era of more effective breast cancer treatments . It randomly assigned Canadian women to have regular mammograms and breast exams by trained nurses or to have breast exams alone .Researchers sought to determine whether there was any advantage to finding breast cancers when they were too small to feel . The answer is no , the researchers report .The second is a study published this month in the Journal of Development Economics . Here’s the executive summary:We examine the impact of removing user fees for healthcare in rural Ghana using data from a randomized experiment that includes rich information on objective measures of child health status . We find that free care increased use of formal healthcare shifting care seeking away from informal providers , with particularly strong effects for children who were anaemic at baseline . There was no health effect on the intervention population taken overall . [ emphasis mine — R.D . ] However , consistent with the utilization findings , there were health improvements amongst those with anaemia initially . Further benefits included a large reduction in health spending , with the effect greater at higher levels of the medical spending distribution . Free care was found to have no influence on a range of malaria prevention behaviours or on the incidence of self-reported illness , suggesting that ex-ante moral hazard is unlikely to be a concern in this particular setting .If you want a reason to doubt the wisdom of redistribution-via-insurance , these are the places to start : In the evidence , widespread and accumulating , that what we spend on medical treatment — and what the government spends for us — does not have a clear connection to how healthy we are and how long we live .This evidence does not make the case for excluding health insurance , and the financial protection it supplies , when you design a safety net . But it does make a case against Obamacare as designed , especially given some of the trade-offs that design requires . And it makes a positive case for deploying resources somewhat differently , focusing more on the nexus of work and money income , and spending less on a benefit that can only be spent in ways that don’t seem to be producing the promised results .
Sorry about blog silence — real life intruded , plus I did have to write a column . But I shouldn’t let the day pass without mentioning the latest big Obamacare news . Final enrollment for 2014 , we now know , will be more than 8 million . The age mix has also improved , with more young people signing up at the end ; as Jonathan Cohn points out in the linked article , the age mix in Obamacare’s first year is now just about identical to the age mix in Romneycare’s first year . Goodbye , death spiral .How did enrollment manage to surge so impressively despite the initial debacle of healthcare.gov ? Obviously they fixed the website ; but the broader issue , as Sarah Kliff rightly points out , is that being uninsured is truly terrible . Uninsured Americans really , really wanted coverage , and they weren’t ready to give up .Kliff doesn’t make this point too explicitly , but this diagnosis has another crucial implication : the benefits of Obamacare , for all its imperfections , are immense . Millions of people who lived extremely anxious lives now have far more security than before . Compared with those benefits , the complaints of some already insured people that they have less choice of doctors than before , or that they’re no longer allowed to retain minimalist plans , look like whining . ( And of course not one of the more serious-sounding stories about soaring premiums and all that has held up under scrutiny . )And speaking of whining , the GOP response seems to be to make every possible insinuation to the effect that the numbers are somehow fraudulent . I actually don’t think there’s a game plan here ; their whole position was premised on the inevitable collapse of health reform , and they have no plan B .All around , as Cohn says , a very good day for reform .
Noah Smith writes that one should not be rude about people you disagree with , because they might turn out to be right . Indeed ; what possible purpose can be served by , say , referring to Austrian economics as a brain worm ? Oh , wait .Actually , I think that Noah was doing the right thing when he brought in the brain worms , and is off on the wrong track on the civility thing . So let me make the case for brain worms .First , picturesque language , used right , serves an important purpose . “Words ought to be a little wild , ” wrote John Maynard Keynes , “for they are the assaults of thoughts on the unthinking.” You could say , “I’m dubious about the case for expansionary austerity , which rests on questionable empirical evidence and zzzzzzzz…” ; or you could accuse austerians of believing in the Confidence Fairy . Which do you think is more effective at challenging a really bad economic doctrine ?Beyond that , civility is a gesture of respect — and sure enough , the loudest demands for civility come from those who have done nothing to earn that respect . Noah felt ( and was ) justified in ridiculing the Austrians because they don’t argue in good faith ; faced with a devastating failure of their prediction about inflation , they didn’t concede that they were wrong and try to explain why . Instead , they denied reality or tried to redefine the meaning of inflation .And if you look at the uncivil remarks by people like , well , me , you’ll find that they are similarly aimed at people arguing in bad faith . I talk now and then about zombie and cockroach ideas . Zombies are ideas that should have been killed by evidence , but keep shambling along — e.g . the claim that all of Europe’s troubled debtors were fiscally irresponsible before the crisis ; cockroaches are ideas that you thought we’d gotten rid of , but keep on coming back , like the claim that Keynes would never have called for fiscal stimulus in the face of current debt levels ( Britain in the 1930s had much higher debt to GDP than it does now ) . Well , what I’m doing is going after bad-faith economics — economics that keeps trotting out claims that have already been discredited .Nor are zombies and cockroaches the only kinds of bad faith ; the worst , as far as I’m concerned , involves refusing to take responsibility for your actual statements . “The failure of high inflation to materialize doesn’t mean that I was wrong , because I only said that there was a risk of inflation” . “When I said that Obamacare spending adds a trillion dollars to the deficit , I wasn’t misleading readers , because I didn’t actually deny that the ACA as a whole reduces the deficit.” And of course , people who engage in that kind of bad faith screech loudly about civility when they’re caught at it .When there’s an honest , good-faith economic debate — say , the ongoing controversy about the effects of quantitative easing — by all means let’s be civil . But in my experience demands for civility almost always come from people who have forfeited the right to the respect they demand .
The good news about Obamacare so far shouldn’t be considered disputable . Enrollments really are above target ; multiple independent surveys show a sharp drop in the uninsured population ; health care cost growth really has slowed dramatically , whatever the reason ; the newly insured are generally satisfied with their coverage . If you want to insist that big problems lie ahead , fine ( but please explain ) , but the facts so far are pretty good .But what I’m getting — and what you get whenever you suggest that things are going OK — is an outpouring , not so much of disagreement , as of fury . People get red-in-the-face angry , practically to the point of incoherence , over the suggestion that it’s not a disaster .What’s that about ? Partly it may be Obama derangement syndrome . I was struck by mail I received after my last column accusing me of shilling for Obama and refusing to admit what a disaster he’s been — when the column didn’t so much as mention the guy . Obamacare was a label stuck on the Affordable Care Act by its opponents , to tie the president to the disaster to come ; now they’re livid that it , and he , are turning out OK .Partly it may be general hatred for any kind of program that helps the less fortunate , especially if they happen to be , you know , not white . Such programs must be disasters — don’t bother me with evidence .And partly , I suspect , there’s now an element of shame . If this thing is actually working , everyone who yelled about how it would be a disaster ends up looking fairly stupid .But , you know , sometimes looks don’t deceive .

Jonathan Cohn looks at the evidence so far on health insurance premiums , and finds things not too bad:Coverage will get more expensive for the majority of consumers , as it almost always does . Changes in premiums will vary enormously , from state to state and from plan to plan . But , overall , the 2015 premiums increases will not be significantly worse than they were in the past . They might even be a little better .Charles Gaba finds much the same . Furthermore , there’s a clear trend within the trend : states that did their best to make Obamacare work are also delivering good deals to their residents . California is heading for an increase of only 4.2 percent . On the other hand , things are not looking too good in Florida:In Florida , by contrast , the Republicans in charge did very little to promote the law and , at times , seemed determined to undermine it . Never was this more clear than in 2013 , when the legislature passed and Governor Rick Scott signed a bill that suspended state government’s ability to reject excessive premium increases .Overall , yet more evidence that this reform works wherever politicians let it work .
Three somehow related stories of the day:1 . Brent Bozell’s Media Research Center is an important part of the machinery that has , for the most part , successfully intimidated the news media into adopting a right-wing slant . ( I’ve faced mass mailings , concerted attacks on my university email , and so on . ) But Jim Romenesko finds something interesting : Bozell doesn’t write his own columns or books , forcing a staffer to do it .2 . The Koch brothers have been running ads in Louisiana with distressed citizens facing ruination from Obamacare . But the people in the ads are all paid actors .3 . Best of all is the news from The Can Kicks Back , which is a Bowles-Simpson-run outfit that was supposed to be the youth arm of Fix the Debt . It has always been an astroturf operation , and a clumsy one at that , doing things like hiring dancers to stage fake flash mobs and placing identical ghostwritten articles in college newspapers . Now , The Can Kicks Back’s campaign against debt is running into trouble , because it’s , um , running out of money .What these stories have in common is that they show how much of what passes for genuine expression of public concern is really just a bought and paid-for ( or , in the case of The Can , not sufficiently paid-for ) front for plutocratic priorities .
The Iowa Senate candidate who charmed the Internet recently with her hog-castration ad—a disturbing metaphor for her claim that she would “cut pork” in Washington—has joined the distinguished club of political aspirants who shoot things they don’t like , on camera .Here’s Joni Ernst at a firing range , taking “aim at wasteful spending” and setting her “sights on Obamacare.”Before Ms. Ernst brought a gun to a political fight , Ron Gould , an Arizona State Senator who ran for Congress in 2012—but didn’t get past the Republican primaries—blew away a copy of the Affordable Care Act .Before that , a man and a young girl in a Herman Cain ad hurled a rabbit out of a catapult and shot it . The rabbit represented the tax code .And before that , Joe Manchin , now the junior senator from West Virginia , killed a cap-and-trade bill .Mr. Manchin won his race . Mr. Cain and Mr. Gould lost theirs . If Ms. Ernst succeeds , she’ll even out the odds for armed politicians in years to come .
The Commonwealth Fund is out with a new report comparing advanced-country health care systems , and the ( mostly pre-Obamacare ) US system looks very bad indeed : vastly higher spending per capita than anyone else , with worse results .Of course , this is nothing new . And as always pointing out the obvious brings out claims that the US system is somehow superior despite its lousy outcomes . Aaron Carroll helpfully reminds us that all of the arguments surfacing here are zombies – arguments that should have died in the face of clear evidence that they’re wrong , but keep on shambling along nonetheless . ( I actually learned the term “zombie idea” from the health care discussion , specifically the unending attempts to trash the Canadian system . )I think it’s important , however , to be explicit about something Carroll obviously knows but doesn’t emphasize : the reason for the prevalence of zombies in this field . Some of it is chauvinism . But the main reason for the zombies is unwillingness to accept facts that conflict with ideology . The American health care system is by far the most privatized , most market-oriented system in the advanced world ; it’s also far and away the most expensive , without any sign of getting anything for all that money .If you are committed to the view that the magic of the market solves all problems , this is disturbing – so it must not be true . Bring on the zombies !
“They call me a long shot , ” Estakio Beltran , a congressional candidate in Washington state , declares in a TV ad , never once disclosing that he’s a Democrat but taking aim with his shotgun at a piñata — an elephant piñata in case anyone doubts what he’s gunning for . Bam ! the gun goes off and the sad-eyed , paper-tattered toy elephant topples . Mr. Beltran’s ad is one of many bamming and kerpowing across the land from candidates pandering to gun enthusiasts . He may not win an election , but his seems the most entertaining or at least the silliest . Particularly so when he racks the empty shell from his gun in macho triumph and rides off like Clint Eastwood , heading east toward the Capitol on a loping donkey ( a Democratic donkey ? ) .Gun ads come and go as political staccato punctuating the electioneering season . They play out as an entirely separate reality from such familiar Americana as the accidental Uzi death last week at the hands of a nine-year-old in Arizona . The latest ads were collected by National Public Radio and , unsurprisingly , shooting a thick wad of “Obamacare” legislation is the cliché of choice among Republicans bearing arms . Will Brooke , a Republican congressional candidate in Alabama , has “a little fun , ” showing off his considerable arsenal of favored weapons — everything from gleaming pistol to ominous assault rifle — and shooting them all at what the Supreme Court has pronounced the law of the land .

Matt Rosendale , a Montana candidate for the House , blasts up and away at what he would have you believe is a federal drone snooping on his sacred freedoms .

The gun lobby stands behind this as the ballot duel plays out .
One of the truly amazing ( and disheartening ) things about the Great Recession and its aftermath has been the continuing insistence of many economists that it’s somehow a supply-side slump , driven by the evils of Obamacare or something . This tends to come from people who view stagflation in the 1970s as having permanently refuted all things Keynes .So I guess it’s worth pointing out repeatedly that the recent slump shows all the hallmarks of a demand-side shock ; in particular , rising unemployment has been associated with falling inflation — the opposite of stagflation . Here’s an international comparison I happen to have produced for other purposes , comparing the change in unemployment from 2007 to 2013 with the change in inflation over the same period:An interesting point : if you fit a linear equation to these points , the slope of the implied Phillips curve is -0.16 — which is the same number the influential recent paper by Kiley ( pdf ) finds using combined time series and cross-section on US metropolitan areas . Just a coincidence , probably , but I had expected the international relationship to look weaker .

SO far , opponents of the Affordable Care Act have lost every major battle to repeal or invalidate it . Some of them are now urging the courts to interpret the health reform law in a way that would guarantee its failure . This is a significant threat — potentially as grave as the previous main legal challenge to the law , which the Supreme Court rejected , 5 to 4 , in 2012 . If the new effort succeeds , it would create total chaos .Having failed to undo the individual mandate to buy health insurance , opponents now claim that , under the law , subsidies for low- and moderate-income Americans to buy insurance may be paid only in those states — currently 14 — that have set up their own online insurance exchanges . This would torpedo a central goal of the law : the expansion of coverage .At first , those of us who support Obamacare thought these claims were a joke . On July 22 , the federal appellate court in Richmond , Va. , rejected one such claim , but the same day , astonishingly , the federal appellate court for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled , 2 to 1 , in favor of the plaintiff in a similar case , Halbig v. Burwell . Similar challenges are working their way through courts in two other circuits .Last Thursday , the entire United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit put aside that 2-1 ruling , agreeing to hear the case “en banc” on Dec. 17 . But now the opponents of Obamacare are asking the Supreme Court to immediately hear an appeal of the Richmond decision , and to pre-empt the full District of Columbia court from hearing the case .The legal challenges say that a provision in the law that references the payment of credits to people who enroll through “an Exchange” that is “established by a State” means that credits are not available in the 36 states that have decided to have the federal government manage their exchanges for them .We are economists , not lawyers . But we note that the statute , while vague at points , confirms , when read in its entirety , that tax credits are to be available on all the exchanges , nationwide . The law specifically instructed the secretary of health and human services to create and manage the exchanges for states that chose that option . And when the law was passed , everyone involved in the law’s passage understood that this directive vested federal exchanges with the same mission and authority as state-mandated exchanges .The expansion of coverage rests on interlocking elements . The law bars insurers from denying coverage to people with pre-existing medical conditions , dropping coverage when people develop costly illnesses , and charging discriminatory premiums . By themselves , these provisions would encourage people to delay buying insurance until they became ill , causing premiums to skyrocket . So to keep premiums affordable , the law requires nearly everyone to buy insurance , and offers low- and moderate-income people financial help — in the form of refundable tax credits . If both the sick and the healthy buy insurance , premiums can be kept within reason .Limiting tax credits to the 14 states that manage their own exchanges ( along with the District of Columbia ) would destroy this careful architecture . Over five million people receive coverage through federal exchanges — two-thirds of all those covered through exchanges and 40 percent of those newly insured by the act . The best estimates suggest that out-of-pocket costs to typical enrollees of the least-expensive plans available in federally facilitated exchanges would soar to 23 percent of household income , from 3 percent — and to 28 percent of income , from 6 percent , for those in the second least-expensive plans . Households would lose about $ 36 billion in tax credits that help make insurance affordable . Some 6.5 million fewer people would be insured . The federal exchanges could collapse , because they would be left with sick patients , saddled with costly premiums .The record is unambiguous : Congress , in 2010 , understood and endorsed the links connecting the sale of insurance , the requirement to carry insurance and the financial aid to make it affordable . Opponents who lost in the democratic process are now seeking to vitiate the law through a perverse reading of it .If the full District of Columbia Circuit takes up the case , it should reject this sophistry . Meanwhile , the Supreme Court should wait to see what the lower courts do before deciding whether to intervene . Whatever one thinks of the Affordable Care Act , it is absurd to argue that its drafters intended to make insurance unaffordable .

Kathleen Sebelius was known for her patience and cool under savage attack by Republicans , who treated her as a stand-in for the health law . She sat through hearings calmly reciting talking points while they fumed and fulminated for their audience .But that turned out to be one of her biggest liabilities , and helps explain why the Obama administration is eager to replace Ms. Sebelius , who said yesterday that she would resign her post as Health and Human Services Secretary . What the health law needed in its first years was a cheerful , populist warrior who could laugh at the truly ridiculous distortions and lies Republicans invented about it , and roar back with the truth . Instead , she came across as a mild technocrat . She never emerged from the defensive crouch she assumed after the law’s calamitous debut . It was one thing for Ms. Sebelius to stumble when Jon Stewart mercilessly made fun of her department’s non-functional website on The Daily Show . That was her responsibility , after all , and there were absolutely no good excuses for why she hadn’t better supervised a program on which rested the reputation of the Obama administration — and more broadly , of government’s role in the health marketplace .But the website problems were essentially gravy to Republicans , who were much more concerned about the law’s most basic premise : using the levers of government to vastly expand heath coverage . She should have been far better prepared for the public fight over people who had to change their health insurance policies because of the law . In October , at a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing , Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee misleadingly described an NBC News report to make her case .“What do you say to NBC News , who says millions are going to lose their coverage ? ” she asked the secretary .Ms. Sebelius’s tepid , meandering response : “In all deference to the press corps , many of whom are here today , I think it’s important to be accurate about what’s going on , and I would defer again to the president of the [ Florida ] Blues plan , who said people will have ongoing coverage , they will be offered new plans , and 50 percent of the people in the market right now will qualify for federal coverage.”That was accurate , as far as it went , but it put people to sleep , and Ms. Blackburn drove right over her answer . Imagine if instead Ms. Sebelius had thrown the question right back : “NBC is wrong , congresswoman , and so are you . No one is being denied coverage— millions are getting it for the first time , thanks to this law . Please stop scaring the public , because it’s much better now than when insurance companies could cancel people on a whim — and did , by the thousands , every year.”That’s a fantasy answer and it’s unlikely that Ms. Sebelius’s successor , Sylvia Matthews Burwell , will take that tone , either . No one in the White House lit a fire under Ms. Sebelius because the administration , including its leader , is set on simmer instead of boil , and seems to have internalized Republican criticism .As Politico pointed out , President Obama ran through a list of accomplishments at a Houston fundraiser on Wednesday and didn’t even mention his own health law . Democrats would rather talk about what they can’t accomplish — a higher minimum wage , equal pay for women , or immigration reform — than what they did accomplish . As long as they remain so reticent , Ms. Sebelius’s departure won’t change a thing .
The Obama administration said yesterday that it would treat the March 31 deadline for enrolling in a health plan somewhat flexibly . Consumers who begin to apply by March 31 will have until mid-April to finish .Relatedly , according to the Kaiser Health Tracking Poll for March , “substantial shares” of the uninsured population don’t realize that the deadline to sign up for health insurance is fast approaching .“As the clock ticks down on open enrollment for new coverage options under the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) , the latest Kaiser Health Tracking Poll finds that six in ten of the uninsured are unaware of the March 31 deadline to sign up for coverage . When reminded of the deadline and the fine for not getting covered , half of those who lack coverage as of mid-March say they plan to remain uninsured . Meanwhile , four in ten of the uninsured are still unaware of the law’s subsidies to help lower-income Americans purchase coverage , and half don’t know about the law’s expansion of Medicaid.”
According to Talking Points Memo , there is “internal dissent” on whether the Republican Party should come up with an alternative to the Affordable Care Act . One congressional aide explained that it’s difficult to come up a replacement , because it would probably end up looking a lot like the A.C.A . :“If you want to say the further and further this gets down the road , the harder and harder it gets to repeal , that’s absolutely true , ” the aide said . “As far as repeal and replace goes , the problem with replace is that if you really want people to have these new benefits , it looks a hell of a lot like the Affordable Care Act . … To make something like that work , you have to move in the direction of the ACA . You have to have a participating mechanism , you have to have a mechanism to fund it , you have to have a mechanism to fix parts of the market.”
IT is no wonder the Obama administration branded its signature health care legislation the Affordable Care Act . For many Americans the basic problem with medicine â health insurance and health care â is that it has simply become too expensive , especially in a sluggish economy .As Americans begin signing up this week to buy insurance , they will begin to test the legislationâs tantalizing promise to make health financially viable . Will the policies deliver care at manageable prices , or will âaffordableâ seem like a hollow promotion ?That probably depends a lot on patientsâ needs , where they live and â importantly â their preconceptions of what health insurance is supposed to do , experts say . The insurance marketplaces , or exchanges , will sell four different levels of plan â bronze , silver , gold and platinum â with the more expensive plans offering the most extensive benefits . And while premiums for the low-end plans may be relatively cheap , they still require significant out-of-pocket payments , in the form of co-payments and deductibles that could add up to more than $ 6,000 a year .âThe perception of cost will vary a lot , â said Dan Mendelson , the chief executive of the consulting firm Avalere Health and a former associate director for health at the federal Office of Management and Budget .Mr. Mendelson predicted that the plans would be welcomed by people who had wanted to be insured but couldnât obtain or afford insurance because of pre-existing conditions , for example , and for low-income earners who would qualify for heavy subsidies for premiums . âFor some people it will be free , and that is a pretty good value , â he said .But the required outlays might seem like a lot of cash to healthy families who previously did without insurance . And they could be downright shocking to patients who last had insurance a decade ago , when health plans tended to require little if any patient payments .âMore of the cost responsibility is being shifted to patients , and more to patients with serious chronic illness , â Mr. Mendelson said , noting that the silver plans , the second cheapest , are intended to cover only about 70 percent of a patientâs medical costs . âThis is different from the concept of insurance weâve been carrying around for a long time . So people who sign up for insurance thinking all will be covered are in for some surprises.âElisabeth Benjamin , vice president for health initiatives at the Community Service Society of New York , says that â perceptions aside â the exchange plans she has vetted in New York State provide consumers a good deal . For a number of years , the group has operated a hot line to help patients troubleshoot their medical bills ; 45 percent of callers are uninsured .âThe premium prices are reasonable â for some people weâre talking about as much as my cable bill , â she said . âYes , there are high co-pays , but thereâs also a cap , â she added . âWe now have people come to us owing $ 50,000 or $ 150,000 . So if the worst-case scenario is you pay $ 5,500 , you wonât go bankrupt over that.âHealth experts also point out that the larger patient payments required under policies developed for the Affordable Care Act are increasingly a feature of private health care insurance as well .âWe are going through a period of revolution in what health insurance is , from more comprehensive to less comprehensive , â said Drew Altman , president of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation . In 2006 , he said , only about half of employer-provided insurance plans had any deductibles ; now 78 percent do .Insurers impose co-payments and deductibles as an alternative to raising premiums , which are often more tightly regulated . But many health economists approve of the practice because even a small co-pay can push patients to price shop for cheaper care , studies show .The goal of the new legislation is to make sure everyone has decent health insurance , but that ideal will come at a cost for many Americans . Even though the White House celebrated the fact that premiums released this week by the exchanges in 36 states proved lower than anticipated , those premiums vary tremendously depending on where you live , your age and which plan you choose . For example , the monthly premium for a low-end silver plan for a 40-year-old runs about $ 300 in many places , but as high as nearly $ 700 in parts of New York . And monthly premiums are more than $ 600 for 60-year-olds in some states , although a few states , like New York , charge the same rate regardless of age .And perhaps more important , all of the plans have significant deductibles and co-payments . Silver plans often do not kick in until the patient has spent $ 2,000 ; many states require patients to cover 20 percent of hospital costs and some drugs â although that cost-sharing is capped at $ 6,350 per individual , or $ 12,700 per family , and effectively less for low-income patients .The Affordable Care Act also includes tens of millions of dollars in spending for patient navigators , who will help patients choose the plan that best suits their needs , and their pocketbooks .Still , a $ 2,000 deductible is high compared with plans provided by employers , where the average annual deductible is $ 1,135 , Dr. Altman said .For those who balk at the new bills , it is useful to remember that those high co-payments are largely a function of the uniquely high price of medical services in the United States â everything from drugs to scans to operating room time .In a country where even minor medical procedures cost two or three times more than elsewhere in the developed world , cost-sharing is far more likely to be a burden . A healthy 60-year-old in California with a chronic condition like asthma who needs little more than asthma medicine and an outpatient hernia operation could easily pay $ 7,000 in premiums plus a $ 2,250 deductible plus $ 3,000 for the 20 percent hospital co-pay . When my husband recently developed a blood clot in his leg after a bicycling injury , the generic heparin shots to treat the condition cost $ 1,400 at the pharmacy . Though the medicine is nothing new , our insurer considered it a specialty drug because of its price . Under some statesâ silver plans , that would require a 50 percent , or $ 700 , co-pay before getting this potentially lifesaving treatment .Does that seem affordable , or not ?
The health care ads being run by Americans for Prosperity — one of the many frantically waving arms of the Koch brothers — are a gift to fact checkers everywhere . Because they deliberately twist the truth to persuade people to “stop supporting Obamacare , ” they have become a machine for producing “Pinocchios , ” the mendacity rating system used by Glenn Kessler at The Washington Post .In today’s installment , Mr. Kessler gave two Pinocchios ( out of four ) to three A.F.P . ads that went up this week . He dinged the ad below for falsely claiming that health insurance premiums are up by 90 percent in New Hampshire .And he criticized this series of ads for suggesting that hundreds of thousands of people in Michigan and Colorado lost their insurance because of the Affordable Care Act , without pointing out that many of those policies were later extended or renewed .Those Pinocchios are fine as far as they go . But since this is an editorial-page blog , we can go a little further than Mr. Kessler and toss many more long noses at the Koch ads . ( Does this dial go to 11 ? )What’s truly erroneous about all these ads ( the full series of which is available on the A.F.P . website , if you have the fortitude ) isn’t so much what they say as what they never say . They give viewers the impression that all the pre-existing problems with the health insurance system are the fault of Mr. Obama’s law , never bothering to explain how bad things have been for decades .For example , it’s true that health insurance premiums will be going up for some people under the new system , in most cases because they will have better coverage . But premiums for private insurance have been rapidly escalating for years , far beyond inflation . Since 2003 , they went up by 80 percent , according to the Kaiser Family Foundation , nearly three times as fast as wages and inflation . And the ads never mention the millions who will now get insurance coverage for free or extremely low cost because of the program’s subsidies . Those people aren’t the Kochs’ intended audience .Similarly , insurance companies used to routinely cancel individual policies , sometimes because the policy holders got sick , or because the companies decided not to do business in a state or region anymore . They can’t do that now . But the ads never mention that , instead falsely suggesting that vast numbers of ordinary people have been left without coverage because of the law .As Politico reported yesterday , a new study says that millions of the so-called “cancelled” policies under the Affordable Care Act ( which were actually policy upgrades ) would have been cancelled anyway by the policyholders . Most people who have individual policies don’t keep them for longer than a year , either because they join a new employer’s plan or change their own policies .That’s the kind of context you will never get in a Koch ad , whether or not the texts of the ads are literally correct . The billionaires behind this effort are on a crusade to end Democratic control of the Senate and ultimately to discredit the idea that government can improve people’s lives through a social program . Context just gets in their way .
The Congressional Budget Office said yesterday that the Affordable Care Act should be cheaper than originally projected .Via The New RepublicIn February , the last time CBO addressed these issues comprehensively , it predicted that the net cost of the law’s coverage provisions would be about $ 1.4 trillion over ten years . Now , CBO says , it’s likely to be about $ 1.3 trillion , or $ 100 billion less .It’s actually the latest in a series of revisions , each one suggesting the law would cost less money than the previous projection had suggested . And why this latest change ? It doesn’t appear to be because the law will reach fewer people . CBO now expects slightly more people to end up with health insurance , at least over the long run . The CBO’s primary explanation for lower costs is that health insurance premiums on the new exchanges — what the administration calls “marketplaces”— are lower than CBO had originally expected they would be .
It has been a week since opponents of health-care reform accused the Obama administration of conspiring with the Census Bureau to undercount the number of uninsured Americans in an attempt to make the Affordable Care Act look more successful than it really is .It was one of the wackier attacks on the A.C.A . And yet it has gained some traction , of sorts . No one in his or her right mind is endorsing the conspiracy theory . But in the aftermath of the accusations , a handful of senators are calling on the bureau to modify its survey method .That would be fine , if they were advocating for true advancements in the bureau’s already impressive statistics-gathering . Unfortunately , they seem more intent on satisfying the conspiracy theorists than in getting the best data possible . Some background : At the center of the conspiracy theory are changes in the way the bureau asks people about their insurance coverage on the Current Population Survey , a monthly survey of some 50,000 people . The changes , in the works for more than a decade , are intended to elicit more accurate responses . The old questionnaire , for example , asked people if they had been insured in the prior year ; the new one is more specific .An unavoidable consequence of the change is a “break in trend , ” which will make it impossible to compare the results from 2013 and 2014 with earlier years . To the conspiracy theorists , this break is evidence of a dastardly attempt to manipulate the insurance picture .What the senators want the bureau to do is keep asking the insurance coverage question the old , flawed way to preserve comparability , in addition to asking it the new way .That would be both undesirable and unnecessary .Undesirable , because asking basically the same question two different ways will yield conflicting data . Sure , one set of data would be intended only for purposes of comparison , while the newer set would reflect the best available tally of the number of uninsured . But conflicting numbers are bound to confuse the public .Unnecessary , because comparative data on insurance coverage is available without having to continue asking a flawed question .If the senators did their homework before reacting , they would know that for the past six years , the bureau has also asked about insurance coverage in the far larger American Community Survey . * The A.C.S . insurance-coverage question , which resembles the more accurate design of the new C.P.S . questionnaire , is currently used to get an annual fix on the number of uninsured people . Because the data goes back six years , it gives a consistent picture of the uninsured population before and after the enactment of the Affordable Care Act .Instead of messing with the C.P.S. , the senators should turn their attention to using the A.C.S . data more effectively . Because of its large sample size , the A.C.S . could be used to create an accurate monthly ( as opposed to annual ) tracking number of the uninsured , akin to what the bureau currently produces to help track unemployment and housing starts .The lack of a detailed monthly tally of the uninsured is a big hole in the nation’s statistics . Health care is one of the largest sectors of the economy and covering the uninsured is arguably the most important public policy related to it . Given that size and importance , it is not enough to broadly measure trends and progress , or lack thereof , once a year .To turn the A.C.S . data from an annual to a monthly figure would not cost much , because the data is already being collected . A one-time appropriation , surely a rounding error in the budget , would be needed to re-purpose the existing data and to create the reporting protocol . Small annual appropriations would keep the monthly reports on track after that .Working with the bureau to deliver monthly , comparable health coverage statistics would be a better use of lawmakers’ time than pandering , even inadvertently , to conspiracy theorists .*The percentage of the population without health insurance , according to the American Community Survey , 1-year estimates:2008 : 14.62009 : 15.12010 : 15.52011 : 15.12012 : 14.8
If you spend enough time on the Internet you’ll eventually encounter a conspiracy theory . If you watch closely enough , sometimes you can actually see one being born .For years now some on the right have speculated that the Obama administration is trying to politicize the national census . Yesterday , Noah Rothman argued on Mediaite that the theory was proven correct by a New York Times article about changes in the way the Census Bureau plans to ask about health insurance coverage . The idea is that the new questions will show a reduction in the number of uninsured people starting in 2014 , which may make it seem as though the Affordable Care Act is working better than it really is . The change in questions will also produce a “break in trend” within the census surveys and thus make it impossible to statistically compare 2013 and 2014 with earlier years .Therefore , the White House must have ordered this sinister change to promote President Obama’s signature domestic initiative .But the article that Mr. Rothman cites , by Robert Pear , doesn’t support the theory . Mr. Pear reports that census statisticians had been trying to change the questions about health insurance for more than a decade ( in other words , before Mr. Obama was president ) because … wait for it … the old questions were not accurate:“When asked about their insurance arrangements in the prior year , people tended to give answers about their coverage at the time of the interview — forgetting , for example , if they had Medicaid for a few months early in the prior year . People are continually moving on and off Medicaid rolls . The number of people who say in surveys that they have Medicaid coverage is almost always lower than the enrollment figures reported by federal and state agencies that administer the program.”Mr. Pear also explained that the new questions were designed to produce more precise information on respondents’ coverage . “The new survey asks people if they have coverage through an exchange , if it has premiums and if the premiums are subsidized”— because consumers often conflate Medicaid with subsidized private insurance .Heinous ! An outrage !
It looks as though Republicans are no longer betting on the Affordable Care Act as a surefire political weapon . The Upshot reported on Wednesday that , in the summer of 2013 , lawmakers churned out 530 news releases using the term “Obamacare.” So far this summer , in advance of the mid-terms when one might expect that number to go up , it’s fallen dramatically , to 138 so far .In addition to this sign of waning interest , Bloomberg reported last Tuesday that Republicans in competitive Senate races “are easing off their strategy of criticizing Democrats over the Affordable Care Act.” Here’s the situation in North Carolina , according to Bloomberg , where Democratic Senator Kay Hagan is in a statistical tie with her Republican challenger , Thom Tillis:In April , anti-Obamacare advertising dwarfed all other spots in North Carolina . It accounted for 3,061 , or 54 percent , of the 5,704 top five issue ads in North Carolina , according to Kantar Media’s Campaign Media Analysis Group . By July , the numbers had reversed , with anti-Obamacare ads accounting for 971 , or 27 percent , of the top issue ads , and the budget , government spending , jobs and unemployment accounting for 2,608 , or 72 percent , of such ads , CMAG data show .Republicans of course haven’t embraced the Affordable Care Act . Now that it’s actually gone into effect , though , they seem to be slowly coming around the reality that it’s not at all the disaster they assumed it would be , and therefore may not draw voters to the polls .
Back when rate shock , website problems and lagging enrollment were threatening to unravel the new health care law before it fully took effect , I concluded a column on Obamacare’s repeated near-death experiences with the following warning to conservatives:The welfare state’s ability to defend itself against reform , however , carries a cautionary message for Obamacare’s critics as well . What isn’t killed outright grows stronger the longer it’s embedded in the federal apparatus , gaining constituents and interest-group support just by virtue of its existence even if it doesn’t work out the way it was designed . And as disastrous as its launch has been , if the health care law can survive this crisis in the same limping , staggering way it survived Scott Brown and the Supremes , then it will be a big step closer to being part of the status quo , with all the privileges and political strength that entails .So yes — it’s possible that this brush with death will be fatal , possible that the law will fall with the lightest , most politically painless push . But it’s still likely that Obamacare will be undone only if its critics are willing to do something more painful , and take their own turn wrestling with a system that resists any kind of change .With the latest numbers showing exchange enrollment climbing toward 7 million , I think we can safely retire that “possible , ” and change the “likely” to an “all-but-definite.” Not because rising enrollment proves that Obamacare is definitely working , in the sense that both its friends and critics would have originally understood the term . We don’t know yet what the paid enrollment looks like or how successfully the program is actually enrolling the uninsured . ( After some grim estimates , this Rand study is making liberals feel a little more optimistic , but still suggests a below-expectations result . ) We don’t know what the age-and-health-status composition of the enrollee pools looks like or what that means for premiums next year and beyond . We don’t know if any of the suspended/postponed provisions of the law will actually take effect . And we certainly don’t know what any of this means for social policy in the long run .But we do know that there won’t be an immediate political unraveling , and that we aren’t headed for the kind of extremely-low-enrollment scenario that seemed conceivable just a few months ago , or the possible world where cancellations had ended up outstripping enrollment , creating a net decline in the number of insured . And knowing that much has significant implications for our politics . It means that the kind of welfare-state embedding described above is taking place on a significant scale , that a large constituency will be served by Obamacare ( through Medicaid as well as the exchanges ) in 2016 and beyond , and that any kind of conservative alternative will have to confront the reality that the kind of tinkering-around-the-edges alternatives to Obamacare that many Republicans have supported to date would end up stripping coverage from millions of newly-insured Americans . That newly-insured constituency may not be as large as the bill’s architects originally hoped , or be composed of the range of buyers that the program ultimately needs . But it will be a fact on the ground to an extent that was by no means certain last December . And that fact will shape , and constrain , the options of the law’s opponents even in the event that Republicans manage to reclaim the White House two years hence .Such political and policy constraints , I should note , are potentially a good thing for would-be conservative reformers , since the serious right-of-center alternatives to Obamacare have always included policies to expand coverage , and with a coverage expansion accomplished , Republicans may find themselves effectively forced in a more serious direction . ( This is a drum that Avik Roy , among others , has been beating for some time . ) Or so I would hope ; of course , they might just end up drifting toward gimmicky micro-reforms instead , or find themselves embroiled a ruinous civil war over how hard to push toward some kind of full repeal .But wherever they go and whatever they do , they will have to deal with the reality that Obamacare , thrice-buried , looks very much alive .
LAST spring , a 48-year-old mother of two young girls in Colorado discovered that she had colon cancer . Her surgeon and oncologist disagreed about whether she needed chemotherapy . So a friend recommended she go to MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston for a second opinion . Just before she booked her plane ticket , a representative from MD Anderson called , informing her that its oncologists were outside her insurance company’s network and that she should bring $ 10,000 for the consultation .Many Americans can relate to this . Last year , a Kaiser survey reported that almost all individuals and families with employer-sponsored health insurance have policies that come with at least some network restrictions . These plans steer us toward certain providers and away from others .This saves a lot of money . Insurance companies can negotiate with in-network physicians and hospitals to accept lower payments in exchange for more patients . They can include in their networks only physicians who are more efficient — who order fewer unnecessary tests , use more generic drugs and tend to keep patients healthier and out of the hospital . As a result , they can ensure that they , and their customers , get more bang for the buck .Despite the fact that so many Americans are already in selective networks , they are nervous that the Affordable Care Act , which I helped design as an adviser to the Obama administration , will further restrict their choice of doctors or make them pay higher out-of-network charges . There was a similar backlash in the 1990s , when managed care was on the rise .But selective networks themselves are not a problem . The problem is that not all networks are of consistently high quality .Millions of people enroll in top-flight managed care plans like Kaiser Permanente , limiting themselves to the physicians employed by these companies . Rarely do you hear Kaiser beneficiaries complain about the tyranny of their restrictive network . Why should they , when they have first-rate providers ?As more people enter the A.C.A.’s new insurance exchanges , they will get to choose between a bronze plan with a narrow network and lower premiums and a platinum plan with a broader network and higher premiums . Inevitably , some insurance plans will offer narrow networks with poor-quality providers .However , there are four ways that we could reassure Americans that they are getting high-quality care despite choosing a narrow network .First , the exchanges should require that networks meet a minimum level of adequacy — meaning there are sufficient numbers of each type of practitioner in every geographic area . The National Committee for Quality Assurance , a nonprofit group , has already created network adequacy standards that could be applied .Second , we need more transparency . Insurance companies should have to publish the measures they use to select their “high performing” or “efficient” networks . This will discourage them from looking at price alone . And consumers should be able to easily find which doctors and hospitals are included in a network . The size of a plan’s network should be as transparent as its premium .Third , we need more reliable ways of measuring the quality of networks and the doctors and hospitals within them . The N.C.Q.A . or Consumer Reports could develop a grading system , from A to F. When comparing different plans , no one should have to rely on U.S. News and World Report’s flawed rankings or hearsay from acquaintances .Finally , insurance companies — which desperately want to avoid repeating the managed-care backlash — should incorporate a “safety valve” for patients like the mother with colon cancer in Colorado . They should allow any enrollee who develops a serious condition like cancer to obtain a second opinion at a recognized center of excellence ( like Memorial Sloan–Kettering , for cancer , or the Cleveland Clinic , for heart disease ) for the price of an in-network deductible or co-payment . The companies could negotiate good prices with these centers in exchange for a large volume of referrals . Patients want to know , and ought to be assured , that they are getting the best treatment possible .In the end , the patient with colon cancer was able to get a second opinion at the University of Colorado Cancer Center , where the specialists were in her network . They reassured her that she didn’t need chemotherapy after all . She paid nothing out of pocket . She was lucky , because she was able to see a high-quality specialist despite her plan’s restrictions . But this shouldn’t come down to luck ; it should be the basic standard of care .
HAVING spent the last year reporting for a series of articles on the high cost of American medicine , Iâve heard it all . There was Fred Abrahams , 77 , a skier who had surgery on both ankles for arthritis â one in New York for more than $ 200,000 and one in New Hampshire for less than $ 40,000 . There was Matthew Landman , 41 , billed more than $ 100,000 for antivenin administered in an E.R . after a small rattlesnake bite . There was Robin Miller , a Florida businessman , who needed to buy an implantable defibrillator for his ill brother , who was uninsured ; the machine costs tens of thousands of dollars , but he couldnât get a price for a make or a model .Extreme anecdotes , perhaps . But the series has prompted more than 10,000 comments of outrage and frustration â from patients , doctors , politicians , even hospital and insurance executives .As of Jan. 1 , the Affordable Care Act promises for the first time to deliver the possibility of meaningful health insurance to every American . But where does that leave the United States in terms of affordable care ?Even supporters see Obamacare as a first step on a long quest to bring Americans affordable medicine , with further adjustments , interventions and expansions needed .There are plenty of interesting ideas being floated to help repair the system , many of which are being used in other countries , where health care spending is often about half of that in the United States . For example , we could strictly regulate prices or preset payment levels , as is currently done for hospital stays under Medicare , the national insurance program for people over 65 , or at least establish fair price corridors for procedures and drugs . We could require hospitals and doctors to provide price lists and upfront estimates to allow consumers to make better choices . We could stop paying doctors and hospitals for each service they performed and instead compensate them with a fixed monthly fee for taking care of each patient . We could even make medical school free or far cheaper and then require service afterward .But the nation is fundamentally handicapped in its quest for cheaper health care : All other developed countries rely on a large degree of direct government intervention , negotiation or rate-setting to achieve lower-priced medical treatment for all citizens . That is not politically acceptable here . âA lot of the complexity of the Affordable Care Act arises from the political need in the U.S. to rely on the private market to provide health care access , â said Dr. David Blumenthal , a former adviser to President Obama and president of the Commonwealth Fund , a New York-based foundation that focuses on health care .With that political backdrop , Obamacare deals only indirectly with high prices . By regulating and mandating insurance plans , it seeks to create a better , more competitive market that will make care from doctors and hospitals cheaper . But it primarily relies on a trickle-down theory of cost containment . The Princeton health economist Uwe E. Reinhardt has called it âa somewhat ugly patchâ on âa somewhat ugly system.âWith half a billion dollars spent by medical lobbyists each year , according to the Washington-based Center for Responsive Politics , our fragmented profit-driven system is effectively insulated from many of the forces that control spending elsewhere . Even Medicare is not allowed to negotiate drug prices for its tens of millions of beneficiaries , and Americans are forbidden by law to re-import medicines made domestically and sold more cheaply abroad .And so American patients are stuck with bills and treatment dilemmas that seem increasingly Kafkaesque . The hopeful news is that American health care spending has grown at a slower pace over the past four years . While that is partly because of the recession , economists say , many credit the cost-containing forces unleashed by Obamacare with a significant assist . Even at that rate , many models suggest that nearly 25 percent of gross domestic product will be eaten up by health care in 20 years . That is not sustainable .âItâs like a diet you canât just stop , because itâs starting to work , â said Michael Chernew , an economist at Harvard Medical School . âAnd remember , we havenât even lost weight yet , weâre just gaining weight more slowly.âMany health economists say we must move away from the so-called fee-for-service model , where doctors and hospitals bill every event , every pill , every procedure , even hourly rental of the operating room . Though insurers try to hold down costs by negotiating discounts or limiting reimbursement , this strategy has limited power because armies of consultants now advise hospitals on what is known as âstrategic billingâ : Losing money from trauma patients ? Hospitals can add on a $ 10,000-plus âtrauma activation fee.â Medicare not paying enough for a broken wrist ? Add a separate âcasting feeâ to the bill .
Paul Clement is a former United States solicitor general and current partner with the Washington law firm Bancroft P.L.L.C . He recently received widespread praise even from opponents for his nimble oral arguments before the Supreme Court against the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act , a law that if left intact would extend health care coverage to more than 30 million uninsured Americans .READING Mostly briefs , old Supreme Court cases and the Federalist Papers , so when I get a chance to unwind I grab novels like “True History of the Kelly Gang , ” by Peter Carey , which is beautifully written and completely evocative of the early days of Australia . Or I’ll read travel writing , like a bunch of Norman Lewis classics , or humor , like an old P. G. Wodehouse book .The only legal book I am reading is Chuck Lane’s book on the death penalty . “The Day Freedom Died , ” about the Colfax massacre , is one of the best legal books I have read . I am also reading “The Trumpet of the Swan , ” by E. B .

Next to the Packers-Bears , Real Madrid-Barcelona has got to be the greatest rivalry in sports . Becoming a soccer fan just kind of happened . When I first started watching soccer in the 1990s , I was kind of skeptical , you know , very low-scoring . It seemed like the referees had far too much control over the outcomes , but I think through watching the World Cup I discovered European club soccer and got hooked . I definitely still think the referees have too much power but have just kind of grown to accept that’s the nature of the game .FOLLOWING How Appealing and Scotusblog are must-reads professionally , but I still turn first to The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s Packers coverage , my favorite bookmark .

LOS ANGELES â THE Anthem Blue Cross representative who answered my call told me that there was a silver lining in the cancellation of my individual P.P.O . policy and the $ 5,400 annual increase that I would have to pay for the Affordable Care Act-compliant option : now if I have Stage 4 cancer or need a sex-change operation , Iâd be covered regardless of pre-existing conditions . Never mind that the new provider network would eliminate coverage for my and my sonâs long-term doctors and hospitals .The Anthem rep cheerily explained that despite the companyâs â I paraphrase â draconian rates and limited network , my benefits , which also include maternity coverage ( handy for a 46-year-old ) , would âbe actually much richer.âI , of course , would be actually much poorer . And it was this aspect of the bum deal that , to my surprise , turned out to be a very unpopular thing to gripe about .âObamacare or Kafkacare ? â I posted on Facebook as soon as I hung up with Anthem . I vented about the call and wrote that the president should be protecting the middle class , not making our lives substantially harder . For extra sympathy , I may have thrown in the fact that Iâm a single mom . ( O.K. , I did . )Then I sat back and waited for the love to pour in . Or at least the âlike.â Lots of likes . After all , I have 1,037 Facebook friends . Surely , theyâd commiserate .Except that they didnât .Instead , aside from my friend David , who attempted to cheer me up with , âMy dad , who never turns down a bargain , would take the sex change just because itâs free , â my respondents implied â in posts that , to my annoyance , kept getting more âlikesâ â that it was beyond uncool to be whining about myself when the less fortunate would finally have insurance .âThe nation has been better off , â wrote one friend . âOver 33 million people who did not have insurance are now going to get it.â Thatâs all fine and good for âthe nation , â but what about my $ 5,400 rate hike ( after-tax dollars , I wanted to add , but dared not in this group of previously closeted Mother Teresas ) ? Another friend wrote , âYes , Iâm paying an extra 200 a month , but Iâm okay with doing that so that others who need it can have health care.âI was shocked . Who knew my friends were such humanitarians ? Has Obamacare made it un-P.C . to be concerned by a serious burden on my familyâs well-being ?The heated reactions even moved offline . Frustrated , I observed to one friend who was covered through her work that when an issue didnât affect people directly , they became âtheoretically generous.â Ask them to donate several thousand dollars so that the less fortunate can have medical insurance â which is exactly what President Obama is asking me to do â and Iâll bet theyâd change their tune about âending inequalityâ and âcreating fairnessâ and âdoing whatâs good for the country.âRefreshingly , the two people who showed real empathy were my insurance broker and my friend Nicole , who sent daily links to news stories about people who were also stripped of their coverage and mandated to buy expensive exchange or private policies without access to their current doctors , yet just missed the cutoff for subsidies .There was one story about people suing Anthem for not being grandfathered in after changing their policies post-2010 . In fact , it was in 2011 that I altered mine , dumping maternity benefits so that I didnât have to pay for everyone elseâs pregnancies . Little did I know Iâd end up losing my insurance and paying for everyone elseâs pregnancies .There was even an article about a cancer patient who had lost access to her doctors . To her credit , Nicole refrained from saying , âBut , Lori , this woman has cancer and you are so much more fortunate ! âLike Bridget Jonesâs âsmug marrieds , â the âsmug insuredsâ â friends who were covered through their own or spousesâ employers or who were grandfathered into their plans â asked why I didnât âjustâ switch all of our long-term doctors , suck it up and pay an extra $ 200 a month for a restrictive network on the exchange , or marry the guy Iâm dating . How romantic : âI didnât marry you just to save money , honey . I married you for your provider network.âAlong with the smug insureds , President Obama doesnât care much about the relatively small percentage of us with canceled coverage and no viable replacement . He keeps apologizing while maintaining that itâs for the good of the country , a vast improvement âover all.âAnd the âover allâ might agree . But the self-employed middle class is being sacrificed at the altar of politically correct rhetoric , with nobody helping to ensure our health , fiscal or otherwise , because itâs trendy to cheer for the underdog . Embracing the noble cause is all very well â as long as yours isnât the âfortunateâ family that loses its access to comprehensive , affordable health care while the rest of the nation gets it .The truly noble act here is being performed by my friend Nicole , who keeps posting Obamacare fiasco stories on my Facebook page , despite being conspicuously ignored , except for my single âlike.â Itâs the lone âlikeâ that falls in the forest , the click nobody wants to hear .
Although few Americans say the Affordable Care Act has helped them , the uninsured rate has declined significantly since the law took effect , and appears to be leveling off at around 13.4 percent .Via GallupThe uninsured rate so far in the second quarter of 2014 is 13.4 % , with the rate in April and May as individual months also averaging 13.4 % , respectively .…The percentage of U.S. adults lacking insurance coverage in the first two months of the second quarter of 2014 is down from 17.1 % in the fourth quarter of 2013 and from the 15.6 % average in the first quarter of 2014 . The current 13.4 % average for the second quarter of 2014 is the lowest level recorded since Gallup began tracking this measure in 2008 .
The Supreme Court’s ruling last week in the Hobby Lobby case wasn’t based on a fundamental right found in the First Amendment or anywhere else in the Constitution . When the justices said that closely held corporations have religious rights that let them refuse to pay for insurance plans that cover contraceptives , they based their decision on a 1993 law passed by Congress , the Religious Freedom Restoration Act .That means Congress has the ability to rewrite federal law to overrule the court’s decision , and Senate Democrats have wasted little time coming up with a bill to do just that . The bill , sponsored by Patty Murray of Washington and Mark Udall of Colorado , was introduced today , co-sponsored by 38 other Democrats . It wouldn’t rewrite the 1993 law , which was intended to protect the religious rights of individuals . But it would make it clear that the law doesn’t permit employers to refuse to comply with the Affordable Care Act , which requires contraceptives to be covered by health insurance .It would be illegal for employers to cite a religious reason for disobeying the health law , as Hobby Lobby did . The only exception would be for houses of worship and religious non-profits , which have already been granted an accommodation by the Obama administration . ( The Supreme Court seemed willing to undermine that accommodation , too , in an order released last Thursday that said religious groups didn’t have to abide by the administration’s rules , but the proposed bill would put Congress on the record in support of it . )A memo issued by Ms. Murray noted that the 13,000 employees of Hobby Lobby took a job at an arts and crafts store , not a church or synagogue .“The Supreme Court’s decision allows for-profit business like Hobby Lobby to impose their religious beliefs on their employees , ” the memo says . “The Court decision ignores the fact that the employees’ beliefs about religion are just as important and deserving of protection as the employers’.”It would be surprising if the bill picked up more than two or three Republican votes since it praises the Affordable Care Act , which is officially loathed by the Republican Party . It’s a message bill , in the cynical parlance of Capitol Hill , which will die by filibuster in the Senate and has no chance of reaching the floor of the House . But at least that message is clear , and next week senators will have to reveal whether they think employers should have the right to intrude on their employees’ lives .
Pulling the plug on just about everything .


HANOVER , N.H. — NOW that it’s clear that Obamacare is here to stay , its supporters should focus on making the program better . Fixes are not a sign of weakness . They are a sign of responsiveness and of good management . And the Affordable Care Act does have its flaws . Here’s a big one : It favors screening over diagnosis .While the distinction may seem arcane , it has real-world implications . Screening is what we offer to the well ; it’s the effort to find abnormalities in those who do not have signs or symptoms of disease . Because screening is considered part of preventive care under the Affordable Care Act , it is provided at no charge .Diagnosis is what we offer to those who do have signs or symptoms of disease . Because diagnosis is not preventive care , it is subject to deductibles and co-payments .In other words : A woman over 40 can have a free screening mammogram . But if she notices a breast lump and goes to her doctor to have it evaluated , she’ll pay for a diagnostic mammogram . That could cost $ 300 . So the woman at lower risk for cancer — the one with no signs or symptoms of the disease — has an incentive to be tested , while the woman at higher risk — the one with the lump — faces a disincentive .Does that make any sense ? No . But it could encourage women with breast lumps not to report their symptoms .Just how crazy this is became apparent to me when a friend enrolled on the New Hampshire exchange . Melissa is a 50-something self-employed author . She chose to be screened for colon cancer using the test doctors are most certain lowers colon cancer mortality — annual fecal occult blood testing .Melissa’s screening test was free under the Affordable Care Act . It was also positive — she had blood in her stool , meaning she was at higher risk to actually have colon cancer . Everyone agreed about the next step : a diagnostic colonoscopy , to figure out where the blood was coming from . That’s not free ; it’s real money , thousands of dollars . But had she chosen the colonoscopy as her first screening test , it would have been free .Melissa contacted her insurer , and a representative suggested she ask her gastroenterologist to resubmit the colonoscopy claim as preventive . Pressure on doctors to recode diagnostic tests as screening tests is the inevitable result of this “incentive mismatch” between screening and diagnosis . But it’s also fraud , and Melissa knew it was wrong .The gastroenterologists already got one fix in the Affordable Care Act . At first , screening colonoscopy was free , but if the test found a polyp , it was correctly reclassified as a diagnostic procedure , and was subject to cost sharing . In February 2013 , regulators fixed the problem , saying insurance companies must also make polyp removal during screening free , noting , “polyp removal is an integral part of a colonoscopy.”It’s true : Subsequent interventions are an integral part of all screening . Were I a mammographer , I’d happily argue that additional mammographic views , ultrasounds , M.R.I.s and breast biopsies are all part of screening .But if you notice a new breast lump , you pay .I wish money wasn’t such a powerful incentive in medical care . But the economists are right : Incentives matter . Right now they favor lower risk patients ( those being screened ) over higher risk ones ( those with signs and symptoms ) .They also encourage a feeding frenzy among providers to recategorize diagnostic testing as screening . Free screenings were seen as a way to get people through the door and ideally to find and address problems before they become more dangerous and expensive .But in practice , it may not work this way . Some hospitals offer free screening knowing full well that the costs will be more than made up for by all the subsequent services required . More testing , false alarms and overdiagnosis are all part of screening . And if you make it free , patients are less likely to give proper consideration to these potential harms — not to mention the potential for a lot of out-of-pocket costs down the line .Here’s the fix : Eliminate the incentive mismatch between screening and diagnosis . Treat them equally . Melissa would share in the cost of her fecal occult blood test . ( But at around $ 10 to $ 20 , it’s still roughly one one-hundredth of the cost of a colonoscopy . )We need people to consider medical care carefully , and that’s what cost sharing is all about . Patients already share costs on what is arguably the most important preventive service , treatment for really high blood pressure , and for procedures as necessary as setting a broken leg . Why would we treat a much closer call — screening — any different ?But if you think the need for this fix is evidence that the Affordable Care Act should be repealed , think again . Melissa had a mammogram at age 29 because her doctor thought she felt a lump . It was just fibrous tissue , but as a result , insurance companies put a rider on her policy disqualifying her from coverage for breast cancer . That’s right : Before the Affordable Care Act , if she developed the cancer that leads to the most deaths among nonsmoking women , she would not have been covered . No one wants to go back there .
Cambridge , Mass .ON the second day of oral arguments over the Affordable Care Act , Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. , trying to explain what sets health care apart , told the Supreme Court , “This is a market in which you may be healthy one day and you may be a very unhealthy participant in that market the next day.” Justice Antonin Scalia subsequently expressed skepticism about forcing the young to buy insurance : “When they think they have a substantial risk of incurring high medical bills , they’ll buy insurance , like the rest of us.”May the justices please meet my sister-in-law . On Feb. 8 , she was a healthy 32-year-old , who was seven and a half months pregnant with her first baby . On Feb. 9 , she was a quadriplegic , paralyzed from the chest down by a car accident that damaged her spine . Miraculously , the baby , born by emergency C-section , is healthy .Were the Obama health care reforms already in place , my brother and sister-in-law’s situation — insurance-wise and financially — would be far less dire . My brother’s small employer — he is the manager of a metal-fabrication shop — does not offer health insurance , which was too expensive for them to buy on their own . Fortunately , my sister-in-law had enrolled in the Access for Infants and Mothers program , California’s insurance plan for middle-income pregnant women . AIM coverage extends 60 days postpartum and paid for her stay in intensive care and early rehabilitation .But when the 60 days is up next week , the family will fall through the welfare medicine rabbit hole . As a scholar of social policy at M.I.T. , I teach students how the system works . Now I am learning , in real time .For health coverage , the baby fares best . He is insured through Healthy Families , California’s version of the Children’s Health Insurance Program , the federal-state plan for lower-income children ineligible for Medicaid whose families can not afford private insurance . California is relatively generous , with eligibility extending up to 250 percent of the federal poverty level of $ 19,090 for a family of three ; 27 states have lower limits .When the AIM coverage expires , my sister-in-law will be covered by Medi-Cal , California’s version of Medicaid , because she is disabled and has limited income . But because my brother works , they are subject to cost-sharing : they pay the first $ 1,100 of her health costs each month . Paying $ 1,100 leaves them with a monthly income of just 133 percent of the federal poverty level . If my brother makes more money , their share of the cost increases .They must also meet the Medi-Cal asset test : beyond their house and one vehicle , they can hold $ 3,150 in total assets , a limit last adjusted in 1989 . They can not save for retirement ( retirement plans are not exempt from the asset test in California , as they are in some states ) . They can not save for college ( California is not among the states that have exempted 529 college savings plans from their asset tests ) . They can not establish an emergency fund . Family members like me can not give them financial help , at least not officially . If either of them receives an inheritance , it will go to Medi-Cal . Medi-Cal services that my sister-in-law uses after age 55 will be added to a tab that she will rack up over the rest of her life . When she and my brother die , the state will put a lien on their estate ; their child may inherit nothing . Even my brother’s hobby runs afoul of the asset test : he enjoys working on old cars , which he can no longer keep .These are the limitations under which 7.5 million Medi-Cal recipients live . Nationwide , more than 50 million people are covered by their states’ version of Medicaid . Some states are more lenient in their income and asset tests , others less so . Nowhere is life in these programs a picnic .That said , Medicaid is an important safety net for the poor , and the Obama reform would expand the program to cover all Americans under 133 percent of the poverty level ( currently one has to be both poor and categorically eligible — a child or a pregnant woman , for example ) . But for the middle class who are thrust into Medicaid by circumstance , the program’s strictures are truly life-altering . My brother and sister-in-law desperately wanted to buy insurance and now wonder how to escape Medi-Cal’s forced penury . My sister-in-law will qualify for Medicare after the mandatory 24-month waiting period for disabled people , but Medi-Cal will be the secondary payer .Their best hope is the survival of the Obama reform . Perhaps my brother can get a job that offers health insurance for the family , but without the reform’s protections , like the prohibition on denying coverage for pre-existing conditions , removal of annual and lifetime insurance caps , and reinsurance for large claims , there is no guarantee that they could obtain insurance . More likely , they would buy insurance on a health exchange . Here in Massachusetts , where such an exchange is in place , they could have purchased a plan with an affordable premium ( at their income level , the monthly premiums range from $ 39 to $ 91 per adult ) . And these money and insurance issues would not have added to the other stresses in their profoundly changed lives .Instead , their financial future is shattered . Family and friends are raising money to buy a wheelchair van and to renovate their home for accessibility . The generosity of the local community is stunning . One incident in particular struck me to the core . A woman from a small community nearby had something for us . A cancer survivor , she had decided to “give back” by placing donation cans in stores around town . She had finished her drive and consolidated the money . The small coffee can she handed over to me and my sister-in-law had a slit in the lid and was decorated with pink felt and ribbons , now a little smudged from handling . Inside were several hundred dollars in small bills . We burst into tears . This is social policy in the richest nation in the history of the world .
IN just over a decade the United States will need 130,000 more doctors than medical schools are producing . So says the Association of American Medical Colleges , which warns of a doctor shortage that will drive up wait times , shorten office visits and make it harder for Americans to access the care they need .The road to Obamacare has seen its share of speed bumps , as well as big potholes . But a physician shortage is unlikely to be one of its roadblocks .Shortage forecasters point to two major factors . One is an aging population . The proportion of Americans who are 65 and older will increase to 19 percent in 2030 from 12.9 percent today , according to federal projections . Second , Obamacare will insure 30 million more Americans by the end of the decade , dramatically increasing demand for physicians . Extrapolating forward from todayâs 2.4 physicians per 1,000 Americans would mean we will need at least 90,000 more physicians by 2020 , or so the reasoning goes .Regardless of your political views , there are good reasons to be skeptical of these predictions . Take Massachusetts , where Obamacare-style reforms were implemented beginning in 2006 , adding nearly 400,000 people to the insurance rolls . Appointment wait times for family physicians , internists , pediatricians , obstetricians and gynecologists , and even specialists like cardiologists , have bounced around since but have not appreciably increased overall , according to a Massachusetts Medical Society survey . Massachusettsâs experience may differ from other areas , particularly rural regions , but the results of reform there suggest shortage fears are exaggerated .The population is indeed aging fast , but the methods of treating illness in old age are also changing quickly . Today , more patients can be cared for in subacute settings rather than in hospitals . And new technologies are turning the treatment of many medical conditions into less resource-intensive endeavors , requiring fewer doctors to manage each episode of illness .Innovations , such as sensors that enable remote monitoring of disease and more timely interventions , can help pre-empt the need for inpatient treatment . Drugs and devices can also obviate the need for more costly treatments . Minimally invasive procedures , like laparoscopic surgeries , can be done more quickly with faster recovery times and fewer physicians . An average patient stay in the hospital is about two days or less following a stent but about seven days following a coronary bypass operation . Research on radiation treatments for breast cancer suggests that 15 treatments can be just as effective as the traditional 30 treatments . Likewise , one larger dose of radiation can be as good at relieving pain from bone metastases as five to 10 separate , smaller treatments . Thereâs every reason to expect the pace of these timesaving medical innovations to continue .Other medical personnel can also expand the reach of physicians to care for a larger population . Nurse practitioners , health aides , pharmacists , dietitians , psychologists and others already care for patients in numerous ways , and their roles should expand in the future . The rise of nonphysician providers will enable more team care . Skilled health aides will monitor patients at home and alert a doctor if certain medical parameters decline . Nurses will provide wound care to diabetic patients , adjust medications like blood thinners and provide the initial management of chemotherapy side effects for cancer patients . Pharmacists will provide more counseling and urgent care . Physicians will remain essential to the proper diagnosis and treatment of disease , but will be backed up by teams who will help manage the more routine features of chronic illness .The opportunity exists to deliver more services and care with fewer physicians , but itâs not a foregone conclusion . Policy changes will be necessary to reach the full potential of team care .That means expanding the scope of practice laws for nurse practitioners and pharmacists to allow them to provide comprehensive primary care ; changing laws inhibiting telemedicine across state lines ; and reforming medical malpractice laws that force providers to stick with inefficient practices simply to reduce liability risk . New payment models must reward investments in technologies that can save money in the long run . Most important , we need to change medical school curriculum to provide training in team care to take full advantage of the capabilities of nonphysicians in caring for patients .Instead of building more medical schools and expanding our doctor pool , we should focus on increasing the productivity of existing physicians and other health care workers while incorporating new technologies and practices that make care more efficient . With doctors , as with drugs or surgery , more is not always better .
THIS month , a dysfunctional website stymied hundreds of thousands of Americans trying to check out new health insurance options under the Affordable Care Act . But that embarrassing technical glitch may have masked a more fundamental question : Can Americans shop effectively for health care ?Most developed countries do not even ask their citizens to be smart health care consumers ; in one way or another , they control prices and offer a more constrained array of options . But Americans are fans of freedom and choice â or at least the illusion of it . And they have cast their lot with so-called consumer driven health care .In the past five years there has been a proliferation of services to help consumers with their deliberations . The American Board of Internal Medicine began the âChoosing Wiselyâ campaign to steer patients away from tests that may be unnecessary . Websites like Health Care Bluebook , Fair Health and Clear Health Costs use insurance databases and patient crowdsourcing to find the going rates in local areas . The Affordable Care Act provides $ 70 million for âpatient navigatorsâ to find the best deals for particular health needs .Useful tools to be sure . But many economists say that placing the onus on buyers is unrealistic and unfair , especially given the way a vast majority of Americans get their health care . âYou canât really be a well-informed consumer right now because our current system is not set up to give the consumer relevant information on price , quality , services and access , â said Glenn Melnick , professor of health care finance at the University of Southern California .Try to be a smart shopper for something basic : a medicine you take every day for a chronic condition like high blood pressure . That should be simple , right ? Hardly .There are some great new technologies to offer guidance for pill purchases , such as GoodRx.com , a company founded by veterans of Facebook and Yahoo ( the type of âA teamâ experts that Kathleen Sebelius , the secretary of health and human services , only belatedly drafted to troubleshoot healthcare.gov ) . The site and its app provide granular information on prescription prices in your area and coupons for deep discounts .âOur mission is to bring transparency to this space , â said Doug Hirsch , one of the companyâs co-founders . âWe have billions of scrips in our database , so you can see what it is at your local pharmacy and can look at the gazillions of discounts involved.â Just over a year old , the site use is growing 20 to 30 percent a month .A few minutes on the site shows what Mr. Hirsch calls âextraordinary price variationsâ : drugs that sell for $ 150 a month at one pharmacy are given away to members of a loyalty program at another . I discovered that a generic prescription anti-inflammatory medicine for which I now pay a $ 20 monthly co-pay through my insurer is on Targetâs limited list of $ 4 prescriptions , although other drugs are far more expensive there .Unfortunately , GoodRx brings transparency to just one aspect of a system that remains an impenetrable black box in other respects . To know if the deals are beneficial , for example , you need to know what your insurance would otherwise require you to pay . Will it be a set co-pay , a percentage of the full price â whatever that is â or no coverage at all ? And that is determined by back-room negotiations between insurers and drug makers , pharmacies and middlemen , producing pricing that shifts from month to month and year to year .On Jan. 1 , tens of thousands of Americans will be shocked to discover that longstanding prescriptions for Advair , the most popular daily inhaler for adults with asthma , is no longer covered by Medco/Express Scripts , the largest private pharmacy benefit manager in the country . Patients will have to pay the retail price of $ 300 themselves .The logic for exclusion is that there are other branded inhalers containing similar types of medicines that will be eligible ( specifically Symbicort and Dulera ) , ones that are somewhat cheaper and should work as well . There is no generic for Advair .Rhinocort AQ , a popular nasal spray that retails for more than $ 150 , will be âexcludedâ by both Express Scripts and Caremark , the other large pharmacy manager .SUCH sudden shifts mean that shoppers need to be ever vigilant to get a good deal on their medicines : Your pharmacyâs current discount program may cover the 20 milligram dose , when you normally take 10 . The lowest price on your migraine medicine may be at a different chain than where you get your high blood pressure pill . The best offer of all may come from the drug maker in the form of a coupon to cover your co-pay , a controversial but widespread practice .And then thereâs the issue of access : Target sells my medicine for $ 4 , for example , but thereâs no Target near where I live , and itâs a bit of a pain to move my prescription .Now imagine scaling up this byzantine process to shop for a truly complicated purchase , like bypass surgery or cancer treatment . Some online services are using billing databases and crowdsourcing to give you a sense of what different doctors and hospitals are charging . But what about quality ?At the extreme end of the marketplace model is MediBid , an online service through which patients can solicit bids from physicians for needed procedures . It was founded by Ralph Weber , a financial consultant , and insurance can not be used . But the savings can be substantial for those without insurance or with a high-deductible policy .After Mr. Weberâs wife recently got an estimate of more than $ 14,000 for arthroscopic knee surgery near the coupleâs Tennessee home ( not including the doctorâs fee ) , he put the procedure out to bid . He ended up driving his wife to Charlottesville , Va. , to take advantage of a $ 3,700 offer . This year , his service has sent patients for total hip replacements to Glendale , Calif. ( $ 14,450 all inclusive ) , San Antonio ( $ 19,000 ) and Oklahoma ( $ 12,500 ) . The usual cost runs more than $ 40,000 and , in some cities , far more .Many new health insurance policies â including those under the Affordable Care Act â are trying to prod us to become better consumers of health care by forcing us to pay a percentage of our bills . If you currently pay a fixed $ 20 co-pay you wonât care much about the price , but if you pay 20 percent it will matter a lot if your scan costs $ 200 or $ 2,000 . Is that fair ?Until there is as much price transparency as there is for laundry soap , as much local competition is there is for gas , and as much freedom to choose between brands as there is for cars , even the smartest consumer may not get a good deal .
GAINESVILLE , Fla .LAST Fourth of July , during a day at the beach , I experienced a sudden pain in my left calf . Two months later , I required an above-the-knee amputation . Compounding my distress was the fact that my doctors had no explanation for why the blood flow to that leg had been cut off . I had none of the usual risk factors for atherosclerosis , the hardening of the arteries . I had low cholesterol and no evidence of diabetes , and I had never smoked . No blood vessels were blocked elsewhere in my body .It took some further detective work to reveal what must have been the cause . Seventeen years earlier , in 1995 , I had surgery on my left Achillesâ tendon . To prevent bleeding during the procedure , a pressurized cuff was placed above my left knee to block the blood flow . Apparently , the cuff was left on too long , injuring the arteries . In the years since , the vessels progressively scarred and calcified , which eventually blocked all blood flow to my lower leg .I lost my leg because of a preventable error . The loss of a limb is traumatic , and I experience waves of sorrow and regret . I struggle with continual pain in my residual limb , and am trying to learn how to walk with my prosthesis . My work as a physician has been put on hold .For the past two decades I have been studying how to prevent errors in health care , and the irony of my present predicament strengthens my motivation to continue the quest . No one should ever have to experience such preventable harm .And yet many people do . Exactly how many , we canât say , because there is no national registry for injuries or deaths caused by medical errors . Over a decade ago , in the best study of its kind , the Institute of Medicine estimated that there were 44,000 to 98,000 deaths per year because of preventable errors in the American health system . For every death there are likely to be at least 10 serious injuries , so we can assume that roughly a million patients are seriously injured each year .Despite calls to action by patient advocates and the adoption of safety programs , there is no sign that the numbers of errors , injuries and deaths have improved . Why ? Because those responsible for the delivery of health care have been unable to change how they do things .They could help themselves by embracing the lessons of great manufacturing companies to improve quality and efficiency . Automatic alarm systems and shut-off switches can be designed to make it nearly impossible for caregivers to do the wrong thing . Checklists and specific protocols based on best practices for each procedure can also help .In my case , if an alarm had alerted the doctor to how long the cuff had been in place , if the cuff had automatically deflated after a period of time , or if a checklist had reminded the doctor to remove it , my leg might never have been injured . Better yet , if the doctors had not used the cuff , which evidence has shown can be dangerous to patients , I would still be walking on that leg today .Most of all , perhaps , we need better coordination and communication among caregivers . Consider what happened to Mary , my former wife and the mother of our two children . In 1988 , she was lying in an intensive care unit with less than a 10 percent chance of survival . Her first symptom , a pain in the sole of her right foot , had seemed so innocent . A neurologist said she had most likely injured a nerve during aerobic dance and the doctor ignored our requests for further tests . But when Maryâs leg began to swell , we sought the help of an internist . She diagnosed thrombophlebitis , inflammation from blood clots . Mary was then admitted to the hospital for a blood thinner , but the medical team gave her too small a dosage . Her clots extended into her lungs . Next she suffered a heart attack , respiratory failure , renal failure and shock .In desperation we transferred her care to another physician , who finally began treating her with corticosteroids for inflammation of the blood vessels . Over the next 24 hours , Maryâs symptoms reversed and she fully recovered . But we nearly lost her as a consequence of delayed decision-making , poorly coordinated care and a medication error .Eliminating errors has the added dividend of reducing costs . The cost for treating Maryâs thrombophlebitis should have been $ 16,000 ; the complications pushed the cost nearly six times higher . The hospital bill for my leg amputation was approximately $ 150,000 , my prosthesis cost more than $ 50,000 , and I have lost months of work .The Affordable Care Act has recognized this reality and is creating new reimbursement systems that reward the quality rather than the quantity of care . The act has also empowered an expert panel to create evidence-based treatment recommendations .I wish I could go back in time and implement these changes before my surgery . But there is no way to turn back the clock . My life will never be the same , nor will the lives of roughly a million other patients who suffer similar preventable injuries each year . But we can make sure that future patients donât suffer the same life-changing harm .
ONE small consolation of our high-priced health care system — our $ 2.7 trillion collective medical bill — has been the notion that at least we get medical attention quickly .Americans look down on national health systems like Canada’s and Britain’s because of their notorious waiting lists . In recent weeks , the Veterans Affairs hospitals have been pilloried for long patient wait times , with top officials losing their jobs .Yet there is emerging evidence that lengthy waits to get a doctor’s appointment have become the norm in many parts of American medicine , particularly for general doctors but also for specialists . And that includes patients with private insurance as well as those with Medicaid or Medicare .Merritt Hawkins , a physician staffing firm , found long waits last year when it polled five types of doctors’ offices about several types of nonemergency appointments including heart checkups , visits for knee pain and routine gynecologic exams . The waits varied greatly by market and specialty . For example , patients waited an average of 29 days nationally to see a dermatologist for a skin exam , 66 days to have a physical in Boston and 32 days for a heart evaluation by a cardiologist in Washington .The Commonwealth Fund , a New York-based foundation that focuses on health care , compared wait times in the United States to those in 10 other countries last year . “We were smug and we had the impression that the United States had no wait times — but it turns out that’s not true , ” said Robin Osborn , a researcher for the foundation . “It’s the primary care where we’re really behind , with many people waiting six days or more” to get an appointment when they were “sick or needed care.”The study found that 26 percent of 2,002 American adults surveyed said they waited six days or more for appointments , better only than Canada ( 33 percent ) and Norway ( 28 percent ) , and much worse than in other countries with national health systems like the Netherlands ( 14 percent ) or Britain ( 16 percent ) . When it came to appointments with specialists , patients in Britain and Switzerland reported shorter waits than those in the United States , but the United States did rank better than the other eight countries .So it turns out that America has its own waiting problem . But we tend to wait for different types of medical interventions . And that is mainly a result of payment incentives , experts say .Americans are more likely to wait for office-based medical appointments that are not good sources of revenue for hospitals and doctors . In other countries , people tend to wait longest for expensive elective care — four to six months for a knee replacement and over a month for follow-up radiation therapy after cancer surgery in Canada , for example .In our market-based system , patients can get lucrative procedures rapidly , even when there is no urgent medical need : Need a new knee , or an M.R.I. , or a Botox injection ? You’ll probably be on the schedule within days . But what if you’re an asthmatic whose breathing is deteriorating , or a diabetic whose medicines need adjustment , or an elderly patient who has unusual chest pain and needs a cardiology consultation ? In much of the country , you can wait a week or weeks for such office appointments — or longer if you need to find a doctor who accepts your insurance plan or Medicare .And those waits are likely to get longer as the Affordable Care Act brings tens of millions of newly insured patients into a system that is often already poorly equipped to provide basic care . “I fully expect wait times to be going up this year for Medicaid and Medicare and private insurance because we are expanding access to care , but we’re not really expanding the system of providers , ” said Steven D. Pizer , a health care economist at Northeastern University in Boston .The Department of Veterans Affairs , which is reeling from revelations of long patient wait times at its hospitals , is actually one of the only health care systems in the nation that openly tracks waiting times and has standards for what they should be . “The V.A . does have some deficiencies which are being exposed right now , but compared to what ? ” said Dave A. Chokshi , a former White House Fellow with the Veterans Affairs Department and a professor at NYU Langone Medical Center . “There aren’t really accepted benchmarks for what’s reasonable in the private sector.”Like the V.A . system , many national health programs abroad are required to keep track of wait times because they are spending government money . But such systems also have medical and financial incentives to curb wait times and dispense preventive care in a timely manner : If people with relatively routine problems can’t see a doctor or a specialist for an office visit , their problems often fester and require more expensive hospital treatment .For that reason , Britain’s National Health Service stipulates a standard that patients should wait in an emergency room no more than four hours if they are to be admitted to a hospital . The organization also tracks how many patients wait more than six weeks for needed diagnostic tests ( 1 percent recently ) . Canada , for its part , tracks wait times province by province and procedure by procedure .And as the Department of Veterans Affairs discovered , when wait times are public , there is often heavy pressure for improvement . “The U.K. puts a lot of effort into reducing wait times because it’s a huge political issue — it wins or loses elections , ” Dr. Osborn of the Commonwealth Fund said . “In the U.S. , compared to other countries , wait times have been less of a national conversation.”To reduce waits , countries have tried various interventions , such as assigning more medical staff members to trouble spots , redesigning scheduling algorithms to prioritize certain appointments and requiring at least one medical office in a given region to be open nights and weekends so patients don’t have to visit emergency rooms . In the Commonwealth Fund report , 39 percent of insured Americans and 48 percent of the uninsured had visited an emergency room in the past two years , compared with less than 25 percent of Germans and Dutch .In the United States , Dr. Pizer said , shorter waits could be achieved by allowing nurses and physician assistants more leeway to open their own practices and perform simple diagnoses and procedures . Medical schools could be better motivated to turn out doctors in needed fields like primary care . The Merritt Hawkins survey found that Boston , the city with the most doctors per capita , had some of the longest wait times , because the city is flush with specialists .Finally , it’s worth remembering that waiting for medical care can be either harmful or beneficial , depending on circumstances , doctors say .Wait times for office visits are certainly “bad for the old and frail who have conditions that require frequent monitoring” like heart problems and diabetes , Dr. Chokshi said . And they can be deadly if a depressed person waits months for a first therapist’s appointment .But patience can pay off for many other conditions , like joint pain and viral infections , where — given a little time — the body often heals on its own .There is widespread agreement that Americans receive unnecessary treatment when it is profitable to do so . For example , they are far more likely to get steroid injections or surgery for back pain than people in other countries , even though medical guidelines suggest six weeks of conservative treatment before other interventions are tried ; backs often heal on their own , and there are risks to the procedures .Sometimes , it would seem , a little more waiting would do us some good .
WE need death panels .Well , maybe not death panels , exactly , but unless we start allocating health care resources more prudently — rationing , by its proper name — the exploding cost of Medicare will swamp the federal budget .But in the pantheon of toxic issues — the famous “third rails” of American politics — none stands taller than overtly acknowledging that elderly Americans are not entitled to every conceivable medical procedure or pharmaceutical .Most notably , President Obama’s estimable Affordable Care Act regrettably includes severe restrictions on any reduction in Medicare services or increase in fees to beneficiaries . In 2009 , Sarah Palin’s rant about death panels even forced elimination from the bill of a provision to offer end-of-life consultations .Now , three years on , the Republican vice-presidential nominee , Paul D. Ryan , has offered his latest ambitious plan for addressing the Medicare problem . But like Mr. Obama’s , it holds limited promise for containing the program’s escalating costs within sensible boundaries .The Obama and Ryan plans are not without common ground ; both propose an identical formula for capping the growth in Medicare spending per beneficiary . And both dip into the same toolbox ( particularly lower payments to providers ) to achieve a reduction of nearly $ 1 trillion in Medicare expenditures over the next decade from projected levels .That’s where the agreement ends . Mr. Ryan believes that meeting the goal over the long term requires introducing more competition into Medicare through vouchers to purchase private insurance .But Ryan’s approach was rendered toothless when the issue’s brutal politics forced him to retreat from his initial tough plan to simply cap the growth in government spending on Medicare and stick the inevitable overage onto beneficiaries . Under his revised plan , private insurers would be required to offer the same level of benefits as traditional Medicare , meaning that any savings would have to come from unidentified efficiencies ( the ever-popular “waste , fraud and abuse” ) .If the cap was breached — as it almost certainly would eventually be — Mr. Ryan blithely says , “Congress would be required to intervene.” Fat chance ; Congress regularly does the opposite when it rolls back caps on payments to doctors and hospitals .Meanwhile , Mr. Obama’s hopes for sustained cost containment are pinned on a to-be-determined mix of squeezing reimbursements , embracing a selection of the creative ideas that have spewed forth from health care policy wonks and scouring the globe for innovations .To Mr. Obama’s credit , his plan has more teeth than Mr. Ryan’s ; if his Independent Payment Advisory Board comes up with savings , Congress must accept either them or vote for an equivalent package . The problem is , the advisory board can’t propose reducing benefits ( a k a rationing ) or raising fees ( another form of rationing ) , without which the spending target looms impossibly large .That’s the view of the bipartisan Medicare trustees , whose 2012 report stated : “Actual future Medicare expenditures are likely to exceed the intermediate projections shown in this report , possibly by quite large amounts.”To be sure , health care cost increases have moderated , in part because of the recession and in part because Medicare has been tightening its reimbursements . But those thumbscrews can’t be tightened forever ; Medicare reimbursement rates are already well below those of private providers .Let’s not forget that with the elderly population growing rapidly , even if cost increases for each beneficiary can be contained , Medicare would still claim a rising share of the American economy .Medicare needs to take a cue from Willie Sutton , who reportedly said he robbed banks because that’s where the money was . The big money in Medicare is not to be found in Mr. Ryan’s competition or Mr. Obama’s innovation , but in reducing the cost of treating people in the last year of life , which consumes more than a quarter of the program’s budget .No one wants to lose an aging parent . And with price out of the equation , it’s natural for patients and their families to try every treatment , regardless of expense or efficacy . But that imposes an enormous societal cost that few other nations have been willing to bear . Many countries whose health care systems are regularly extolled — including Canada , Australia and New Zealand — have systems for rationing care .Take Britain , which provides universal coverage with spending at proportionately almost half of American levels . Its National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence uses a complex quality-adjusted life year system to put an explicit value ( up to about $ 48,000 per year ) on a treatment’s ability to extend life .At the least , the Independent Payment Advisory Board should be allowed to offer changes in services and costs . We may shrink from such stomach-wrenching choices , but they are inescapable .

WASHINGTON — LOST in all the debate last week about whether or not the Affordable Care Act will hurt the economy is the fact that health care is already imposing a drag on growth .The health care sector has repeatedly helped to pull the economy from recession in recent decades , but this time around it is lagging behind the recovery .Health care spending grew more slowly than the economy in 2011 and 2012 and will probably be found to have done so again in 2013 . Meanwhile , health care employment also expanded more slowly than overall employment last year — and the government estimates that in January employment actually shrank for only the second time since 1990 .The reasons for this slowdown are not well understood . The Great Recession is clearly part of the story . Experts also point to changes in technology and in the way care is delivered and paid for . It seems likely that the landmark 2010 legislation is playing at least a small part , but the magnitude of its impact is hotly disputed .The consequences are easier to see , though : Lower health care spending isn’t helping the economy to heal .Spending less on health care is a longstanding goal of pretty much everyone who doesn’t work in the health care industry . The United States spends much more on health care than do other countries , and it seems likely that some of the money could be put to better use elsewhere . Also , making the health care sector more efficient not only frees up people , money and office space in places like Boston’s hospital district , but it also cuts labor costs in other industries by cutting insurance premiums .But in the nation’s current economic malaise , idled resources are not being put to better use . Workers , companies and the federal government are all paying down debt rather than spending and investing . Fewer homes are being bought ; companies are building few factories . The government has been cutting back at a pace exceeded in modern times only during the military demobilizations after the Vietnam War and the Cold War .In the past , the health care industry leaned against the wind during downturns . The industry added jobs in every month from January 1990 through December 2013 , save for a month in the summer of 2003 . In 2001 , a recession year that saw total employment shrink 1.3 percent , health care jobs rose 3.5 percent .But the expansion of health care employment has slowed sharply over the past five years . Last year industry payrolls grew just 1.4 percent — almost a percentage point below the average annual increase in the decade before the 2007-9 recession .Health care prices are also rising more slowly . The 1.4 percent increase in 2013 was the slowest pace of health care inflation in at least half a century , and it was a key contributor to the sluggish 1.1 percent annual pace of overall inflation .This seems good . Inflation is widely reviled . But there is evidence that moderate inflation can help to stimulate economic activity . Rising prices spur people to borrow and spend more quickly . Rising prices also tend to raise nominal wages , making it easier for borrowers to pay fixed debts like mortgage loans .And sluggish inflation can be self-perpetuating . Inflation is rising slowly because the economy is weak , and slow inflation is restraining faster growth .Some economists see the slowdown in health care spending as a straightforward consequence of our broader economic problems : We’re spending less on health care because we’re spending less on everything . The implication is that the trend is temporary .But that does not explain why health care spending has been recovering more slowly than spending on everything else . The most recent data , for 2012 , show that health care spending grew 3.7 percent while the economy grew 4.6 percent .An analysis last year by David Cutler , a Harvard economist who was President Obama’s chief health care adviser during the 2008 presidential campaign , attributed 37 percent of the decline in health care spending from 2003 to 2012 to the recession and another 8 percent to specific changes in federal health care spending .The rest , he said , is harder to explain — but also more likely to endure . Expensive innovations like new drugs are arriving at a slower pace . A new focus on efficiency appears to be reducing costs . And changes that require patients to pay for a larger share of the care they receive may be inducing more second thoughts .The White House argued in a November analysis that the Affordable Care Act “is contributing to the recent slow growth in health care prices and spending.” And last week , the Congressional Budget Office agreed that specific cuts in spending on Medicare have “contributed to the overall slow rate of cost growth in health care since the law’s enactment.” Since that time , the budget office has reduced its estimate of Medicare spending in 2020 by 12 percent , or $ 109 billion .The impact of these changes might have been less painful in good times . But Professor Cutler said it would have been ridiculous to argue for the preservation of the existing system , even temporarily , as a kind of economic stimulus program .“If you take an industry that’s countercyclical and you make it grow slower , then that’s going to hurt you in a recession , ” he said . “That’s absolutely true . But I’m not sure the right answer is to say , ‘Let’s take one sector that’s clearly bloated and imposing a horrible tax on the economy and make that sector stay bloated.’ ”Katherine Baicker , a professor of health economics at the Harvard School of Public Health , said it was a mistake to focus on the pain caused to workers in the health care industry rather than the benefits to everyone else .The cost of health care , she noted , is broadly distributed . Everyone pays for the industry’s prosperity , either directly or in the form of insurance premiums .“Do you really want to pay for surgeons’ salaries by having low-income people not be able to afford health insurance ? ” she said . “It’s like the world’s least efficient jobs program . No one is suggesting that spending money on health care is bad . It’s just that for a given outcome , if you could get it with fewer resources , that would be better for everyone . You could get more health . You could get more other stuff.”
Three blog posts and a column should probably suffice to cover the debate over Obamacare and work incentives , but I don’t want to let the topic drop without first stepping back and talking about the actual health policy disagreement here . My column and posts last week criticized what struck me as a kind of insouciance from liberals about this issue , shading into a post-work utopianism that doesn’t wrestle with what , in practice , the decline of work is actually likely to mean for issues of class , mobility , and social equality . But it’s also important to recognize that for many liberal writers , the controlling assumption here is not anti-work or pro-work . It’s just pro-universal health care as a basic standard for a decent society , with the consequences taken as they come .I would prefer that this perspective was accompanied by less chatter about how the only people working less because of Obamacare will be The Most Hardworking Amazing Moms in America , and fewer suggestions that it’s indecent and unpatriotic to worry about how welfare policy influences economic decision-making . But stripped of the Panglossian window dressing , it’s entirely reasonable to believe that some public goods are too important to be withheld just because they might have a few perverse consequences . ( I can certainly think of a few policies I would support even if they took a bite out workforce participation . )At least where the center-left is concerned , then , if you dig deep enough into the work-incentives debate you’ll hit the same old argument about the importance of universal comprehensive insurance . That’s why you keep seeing Obamacare’s defenders argue that the law’s income effect — where people work less because they’re getting insurance benefits at a much-reduced cost — is mostly fine , because we don’t want people having to work to afford a basic good like health insurance . And it’s why , when they talk about the substitution effect — the way the the subsidy phase-out creates an effective marginal tax that discourages working longer hours or taking a higher-paying job — they usually concede the existence of a problem , but then argue that the best way to solve it would be to extend Obamacare’s existing benefit further up the income ladder , or make it universal … in each case , at an expense that conservatives would inevitably oppose .What’s being implicitly ruled out , in both cases , is the possibility that government should be subsidizing insurance , but also subsidizing less of it than Obamacare does , and that the scope of the existing insurance model is making both the income and the substitution effects larger than they need to be . This is basically the theory behind the most plausible conservative alternative — a flat subsidy for catastrophic coverage — to the health care law we actually got . And though liberals mostly reject it , I think it’s a theory worth entertaining even if you believe absolutely in the kind of redistribution inherent in Obamacare … because even granted the pro-redistribution premise it’s still not obvious that subsidizing comprehensive insurance is the best way to go about it .Think about it this way . The welfare state delivers a basket of subsidies to lower-income Americans . Some of these subsidies take the form of cash , and some are direct subsidies for various goods ( food , housing , health insurance ) . Some are tied to work — the earned income tax credit is the notable example — and some of them are not . Pre-Obamacare , the main subsidy for health insurance was tied to work , which both conservatives and liberals tend to regard as a less-than-ideal design ; it was also open-ended and regressive , making it a lousy deal for low-income Americans , period .So we can agree that we should be transitioning away from that model . But there’s no necessary reason why , in the course of that transition , we should just set the new “health care” share of the low-income basket at the levels suggested by the existing insurance model , when that model plainly isn’t delivering value for those dollars overall . Maybe , instead , it would make more sense to take some of the money that Obamacare spends chasing the goal of comprehensive coverage and spend it , say , on giving single workers some of the same E.I.T.C . benefits as families . Or on a larger child tax credit . Or on a straightforward payroll tax cut . Or — to pick a liberal cause , instead of a reform conservative idea — new experiments in universal pre-kindergarten !If severing health insurance from work inevitably reduces workforce participation , that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t gradually sever it , and seek to subsidize insurance in a different way . But it means that we should think seriously about what else we should be doing , and whether we should be spending as much as Obamacare spends on insurance when there are other transfers that might not offer as many work disincentives , might give a stronger boost to upward mobility , and might do more long-term good .On the last point , I don’t want to rehearse the entire debate about catastrophic versus comprehensive coverage , and the good that health insurance does or doesn’t do . I’ll just note two recent items that I think are relevant to this debate . The first is a big Times story , running today:One of the largest and most meticulous studies of mammography ever done , involving 90,000 women and lasting a quarter-century , has added powerful new doubts about the value of the screening test for women of any age .It found that the death rates from breast cancer and from all causes were the same in women who got mammograms and those who did not . And the screening had harms : One in five cancers found with mammography and treated was not a threat to the woman’s health and did not need treatment such as chemotherapy , surgery or radiation .The study , published Tuesday in The British Medical Journal , is one of the few rigorous evaluations of mammograms conducted in the modern era of more effective breast cancer treatments . It randomly assigned Canadian women to have regular mammograms and breast exams by trained nurses or to have breast exams alone .Researchers sought to determine whether there was any advantage to finding breast cancers when they were too small to feel . The answer is no , the researchers report .The second is a study published this month in the Journal of Development Economics . Here’s the executive summary:We examine the impact of removing user fees for healthcare in rural Ghana using data from a randomized experiment that includes rich information on objective measures of child health status . We find that free care increased use of formal healthcare shifting care seeking away from informal providers , with particularly strong effects for children who were anaemic at baseline . There was no health effect on the intervention population taken overall . [ emphasis mine — R.D . ] However , consistent with the utilization findings , there were health improvements amongst those with anaemia initially . Further benefits included a large reduction in health spending , with the effect greater at higher levels of the medical spending distribution . Free care was found to have no influence on a range of malaria prevention behaviours or on the incidence of self-reported illness , suggesting that ex-ante moral hazard is unlikely to be a concern in this particular setting .If you want a reason to doubt the wisdom of redistribution-via-insurance , these are the places to start : In the evidence , widespread and accumulating , that what we spend on medical treatment — and what the government spends for us — does not have a clear connection to how healthy we are and how long we live .This evidence does not make the case for excluding health insurance , and the financial protection it supplies , when you design a safety net . But it does make a case against Obamacare as designed , especially given some of the trade-offs that design requires . And it makes a positive case for deploying resources somewhat differently , focusing more on the nexus of work and money income , and spending less on a benefit that can only be spent in ways that don’t seem to be producing the promised results .
LATER this month , the Supreme Court will rule on the Obama administration’s health care law , the Affordable Care Act , deciding whether to uphold or strike down the entire law , or to keep some provisions .No matter the decision , the political ramifications in this election year will be big . After all , the presidential contenders are President Obama , the top-ranking promoter of the law , and Mitt Romney , the architect of a 2006 health care overhaul in Massachusetts that was , in pivotal ways , the model for the national law .But experts on health care policy say the practical effect of the court’s decision will probably be less earth-shattering than some people think . If the court takes what many observers believe will be the most likely route and strikes down the individual mandate — the requirement that virtually everyone purchase insurance — many more currently uninsured people are still likely to receive health coverage , they say .Even if the law is struck down entirely — which could happen if the court decides that the other provisions are too intertwined with the mandate — many experts say that some changes the law has already set in motion will continue , probably more slowly , but possibly at a more urgent pace in reaction to the elimination of the federal law .“It would have less effect in the short term than most people might think , but it would have much more of a psychological and political effect , ” said Gail Wilensky , a health economist who headed Medicare and Medicaid during the administration of the elder President Bush . She suggested that , while the individual mandate seems vulnerable to being ruled unconstitutional , striking down the entire law seems “highly unlikely , and to my way of thinking , highly undesirable , because I think it’s unnecessary.”And if the law is upheld ? More people will get coverage , but significant problems in the health care system will remain . Chief among them is the high cost of medical care . Massachusetts , for example , has only begun to tackle the issue of health care costs , with proposals in the State Legislature that were introduced this year .Still , nationally , there are now some pilot programs by insurers and hospitals trying to tackle pieces of the cost problem on their own .“I think much of the transformation of the health care delivery system is moving forward , regardless of the court action , ” said Karen Davis , the president of the Commonwealth Fund , a nonpartisan research foundation in New York . “How do we get more efficient ? How do we keep people out of hospitals ? People are kind of gearing up for this . That’s going to continue . Obviously , it will continue at a faster pace if some of the payments for quality and efficiency in the law continue , but we are already beginning to see a slowdown in hospital costs nationally.”Most of the major elements of the Affordable Care Act have not taken effect , and would not until 2014 . The full law would extend coverage to about 30 million uninsured people — roughly 17 million of those would be covered through an expansion of state Medicaid programs to include everyone earning up to 138 percent of the income established as the federal poverty line . The Medicaid expansion could still take place if the individual mandate were to be struck down , a number of health care experts say .The individual mandate would require that millions of uninsured people who are not eligible for Medicaid purchase insurance or that their employers provide it . Subsidies would be available through insurance exchanges , and those who could not show a valid reason for not purchasing insurance would pay a penalty on their income taxes .If the individual mandate is eliminated , but the exchanges remain , significant numbers of uninsured people are likely to purchase insurance anyway , said Amy Lischko , who served in Mr. Romney’s administration when he was governor and helped craft the Massachusetts health care overhaul .
Ezra Klein , in his new capacity as one of the impresarios behind Vox , has written a pair of attention-grabbing posts — here , and then here — defending the proposition that Obamacare has , in some sense , “won , ” and that conservatives who can’t come to terms with that victory can’t come to terms with reality itself . Reading them , it struck me that this argument would benefit from laying down some specific markers for the near future , because Klein seems to move back and forth between two definitions of success . At times , as when he writes that Obamacare “has won its survival” and allows that that “there are still many good critiques to make” of the law , he seems to be using a narrow definition , with which I mostly agree — the law won’t collapse under its own weight , the enrollment levels are high enough to make a return to the coverage status quo ante unlikely , etc . But when he uses language like “the individual mandate … is working” and “the law is back on its expected track , ” and concludes that “ [ Kathleen Sebelius ] can leave with the law she helped build looking , shockingly , like a success , ” it implies a stronger definition of victory , in which Obamacare isn’t just continuing , isn’t just unlikely to be swiftly repealed , but is clearly succeeding as a policy in basically the way its advocates predicted that it would .So I think it would be useful for the law’s supporters to specify the metrics/numbers/outcomes that would vindicate the latter claim . Here are three fronts where specificity would be helpful:Enrollment . In the summer of 2012 , after the Supreme Court decision freeing up states to reject the Medicaid expansion , the C.B.O . projected that 14 million Americans would get coverage under Obamacare in the first year , and 33 million by 2022 . This February , after the botched rollout , the projections were 13 million in 2014 , 27 million in the long run . The latest estimate , out this month , drops the 2014 projection down to 12 million , and the long-term number to 26 million . Meanwhile , the question of how many previously-uninsured people have gained insurance as of right now is , as this Vox explainer suggests , quite difficult to answer ( and sadly , it may be about to become even more difficult ) , but a guesstimate of 9-10 million seems pretty plausible — and short , N.B. , of even the C.B.O.’s more modest projection for this year .So … how low can the numbers go before they start to make the law look like something less than a success ? I assume that liberals will declare victory , with some reason , if Obamacare meets the C.B.O.’s current ( reduced ) expectations , this year and beyond . But what if it doesn’t ? Suppose that by the end of 2016 , when the C.B.O . expects the total number of uninsured to have fallen by 25 million , it’s only fallen by , say , 15 million instead — and most of the previously uninsured are getting coverage through Medicare , while the exchanges are mostly populated by people whose prior individual-market coverage was cancelled , either in 2014 or once grandfathering runs out . Will that be a success story ? Presumably there’s some kind of shortfall that the law’s supporters would consider , if not a sign of outright failure , than at least a reason to be fairly disappointed with how Obamacare has worked . It would be helpful to know what they think that long-run number lies .The cost curve . Before we entered into the agony of the botched roll-out , the law’s supporters were eagerly citing the persistently low rate of health care inflation as a sign that Obamacare was already working as designed , already having a beneficial effect . But as Vox’s Sarah Kliff reported yesterday , the latest inflation numbers cast some doubt on that hopeful hypothesis , with federal data indicating “that health care spending is now growing just as quickly as it was prior to the recession.”Now this may be temporary : Some kind of cost inflation was always likely to be associated with this year’s roll-out of subsidies and Medicaid spending , and the law’s supporters can reasonably argue that we should wait a few years , until the coverage expansion ( however large ) has become a normal feature of the system , to judge Obamacare’s impact on inflation overall .But at a certain point that judgment will need to be made . So , again , what should be the standard ? What should be the baseline ? Does Obamacare need to hold inflation to the low 2011-2012 pace ( a pace , again , that many liberals wanted to credit to its early impact ) in order to be counted as a cost-containing success ? Does it just need to hold inflation below , say , a 10 or 20-year average ? ( Note that both on its own terms and relative to overall inflation , health cost inflation had been declining for seven years before Obamacare was passed — so just holding either rate below the average of 2000-2010 would not actually be that impressive . ) In other words — what does the Affordable Care Act have to achieve in order to live up to its name ?Health outcomes . It’s been crowded out by the website drama like everything else , but one of the major divides between Obamacare supporters and skeptics was over whether , and to what extent , the law would literally be a lifesaver — with writers like Klein famously invoking “lives saved” figures in the hundreds of thousands during the run-up to the law’s passage , while doubters cited the surprisingly-weak link between insurance status and health outcomes , and raised the potential public-health downsides , in terms of innovations lost or never sought , of increasing government control .Now public health data can be even fuzzier and more debatable than cost inflation and enrollment numbers . But even with lower-than-hoped-for enrollment figures overall , we should still be able to see some of the happy consequences , at some point , if Klein et . al . are right : Looking back from 2020 or 2025 , certainly , there should be some kind of disjuncture between U.S. health outcomes pre- and post-Obamacare ( maybe a reversal of this trend , at the very least ? ) , and some kind of outcomes gap should open between states that implemented the law fully and states that refused the extra Medicaid dollars .So here , too , I’m curious what liberals expect to see , what they’ll count as vindication , what would disappoint them , and what kind of results they think will be sufficient to prove that Obamacare is , in fact , a lifesaving success .And then for my own part , I’ll lay down this marker for the future : If , in 2023 , the uninsured rate is where the C.B.O . currently projects or lower , health inflation’s five-year average is running below the post-World War II norm , and the trend in the age-adjusted mortality rate shows a positive alteration starting right about now , I will write a post ( or send out a Singularity-wide transmission , maybe ) entitled “I Was Wrong About Obamacare” — or , if he prefers , just “Ezra Klein Was Right.”
AT Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center , we recently made a decision that should have been a no-brainer : we are not going to give a phenomenally expensive new cancer drug to our patients .The reasons are simple : The drug , Zaltrap , has proved to be no better than a similar medicine we already have for advanced colorectal cancer , while its price â at $ 11,063 on average for a month of treatment â is more than twice as high .In most industries something that offers no advantage over its competitors and yet sells for twice the price would never even get on the market . But that is not how things work for drugs . The Food and Drug Administration approves drugs if they are shown to be âsafe and effective.â It does not consider what the relative costs might be once the new medicine is marketed .By law , Medicare must cover every cancer drug the F.D.A . approves . ( A 2003 law , moreover , mandates payment at the price the manufacturers charge , plus a 6 percent cushion . ) In most states private insurers are held to this same standard . Physician guideline-setting organizations likewise focus on whether or not a treatment is effective , and rarely factor in cost in their determinations .Ignoring the cost of care , though , is no longer tenable . Soaring spending has presented the medical community with a new obligation . When choosing treatments for a patient , we have to consider the financial strains they may cause alongside the benefits they might deliver .This is particularly the case with cancer , where the cost of drugs , and of care over all , has risen precipitously . The typical new cancer drug coming on the market a decade ago cost about $ 4,500 per month ( in 2012 dollars ) ; since 2010 the median price has been around $ 10,000 . Two of the new cancer drugs cost more than $ 35,000 each per month of treatment .The burden of this cost is borne , increasingly , by patients themselves â and the effects can be devastating . In 2006 , one-quarter of cancer patients reported that they had used up all or most of their savings paying for care ; a study last year reported that 2 percent of cancer patients were driven into bankruptcy by their illness and its treatment . One in 10 cancer patients now reports spending more than $ 18,000 out of pocket on care .Which brings us back to our decision on Zaltrap . In patients with advancing , metastatic colorectal cancer , the new drug , approved by the F.D.A . in August and jointly marketed by Sanofi and Regeneron , offers the same survival benefit as Genentechâs Avastin , which works through a similar molecular mechanism . When compared with the standard chemotherapy regimen alone , adding either medicine has been shown to prolong patient lives by a median of 1.4 months . Major clinical practice guidelines , like those from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network , agree that Zaltrap is no better than Avastin in this setting . ( Full disclosure : Two of us , Dr. Bach and Dr. Saltz , have been paid consulting fees by Genentech . )But Avastin costs roughly $ 5,000 a month : very expensive in its own right , yet less than half of Zaltrapâs price tag . And while the side effects in both drugs are roughly equal , doses of Avastin generally take less time to administer than those of Zaltrap , which makes Avastin more convenient for patients .Consider that colorectal cancer is typically diagnosed in older individuals and the cost issue becomes starker still . Many patients are on Medicare and living on fixed incomes . And because Medicare requires patients to co-pay for cancer drugs , 20 percent of the cost of drugs like Zaltrap and Avastin is passed on â absorbed either by supplemental insurance or by the patients themselves .To put these percentages in perspective , an older colorectal cancer patient without extra insurance would have to pay more than $ 2,200 out of pocket for a monthâs treatment with Zaltrap . Thatâs greater than the monthly income for half of Medicare participants .Once you take all this into account it may seem surprising that the decision to exclude Zaltrap from our hospitalâs formulary was a hard one to make . But because our medical culture equates ânewâ with âbetterâ so unequivocally , a decision like this one can seem out of place at a leading cancer hospitalPolitical rhetoric today is similarly slanted . Our refusal to adopt this remarkably expensive therapy risks being labeled ârationing , â not rational .This political climate also helps explain why the Affordable Care Act precludes Medicare from changing its coverage or payment amounts based on cost comparisons like the one we have outlined , even when two drugs appear to work equally well . And it is probably why neither presidential candidate has addressed runaway cancer drug prices .But if no one else will act , leading cancer centers and other research hospitals should . The future of our health care system , and of cancer care , depends on our using our limited resources wisely .The current level of spending on health care , estimated to be $ 2.8 trillion this year , is already too high . The growth rate in health spending is unsustainable .Of course , we know our decision about Zaltrap will not meaningfully address these larger problems . Projected United States sales of Zaltrap in 2013 are less than $ 150 million , or 0.005 percent of all dollars spent on health care . Our use would account for a very small percentage of even that number .But it is a step in the right direction â one of many we need to take .

DURHAM , N.C. â IF an antibiotic would cure your infection , your doctor would probably still warn you about the chance of sun sensitivity before prescribing the pill .But even when the costs of a medical intervention might force patients to choose between paying the bill or keeping up with their mortgages , American physicians rarely discuss that serious side effect with them . One physician recently explained to me that he felt money talk would âviolate the doctor-patient relationship.âGiven how much attention we have been focusing on health care costs and the Affordable Care Act , now is the time to change such thinking .In The New England Journal of Medicine last month , two colleagues and I wrote an essay intended for physicians ; we argued that they should discuss out-of-pocket costs with patients just as they discuss any side effects . After all , the financial burden of paying for medical care can cause more distress in patientsâ lives than many medical side effects , and patients can decide whether any of the downsides of treatment are justified by the benefits .Take , for example , a patient with colon cancer whose oncologist is considering prescribing Avastin . Most physicians would go out of their way to warn that this drug could harm a patientâs heart ; the data show that it carries a 2 percent risk of cardiovascular toxicity . But few physicians would discuss the price , even though Avastin can cost more than $ 50,000 per patient , and a Medicare patient without supplemental insurance could be responsible for nearly $ 9,000 of that .The Affordable Care Act will have only a modest impact on patient exposure to health care costs because the limits it sets on out-of-pocket costs are still high compared with most peopleâs resources . And in the last six years , according to the Kaiser Family Foundation , weâve seen a threefold increase in the number of people choosing high-deductible plans .The Center for American Progress estimates that a breast-cancer patient in Massachusetts with a high-deductible plan could face more than $ 50,000 in medical expenses . Thatâs more than the average lifetime savings of the majority of American families .In our New England Journal article , we tried to convince physicians that they needed to start incorporating the cost of care into their clinical conversations . But patients should not be afraid to take the lead and ask how much a pill or procedure will cost . Far too often , patients bring up such questions only after they have already experienced treatment-related financial distress . My colleagues and I confirmed that during interviews with breast cancer survivors ; in a number of cases , the physician had told the patient that if she had only mentioned a concern about the cost earlier , the doctor could have suggested less expensive alternatives .That kind of lapse should never happen . No one should have to suffer unnecessarily from the cost of medical care . Simply put , discussing costs in the doctorâs office is good medicine .
NESTLED within the many commendable aspects of President Obama’s health care plan — including the individual mandate — sits a problem that has gone virtually unnoticed by commentators obsessed with the Supreme Court’s review of the law : how to pay for it .About 65 percent of the cost of the Obama health care law is supposed to be met by Medicare expense reductions and tax increases totaling roughly $ 1 trillion over 10 years . The deficiency with this plan is that it amounts to double-counting , using urgently needed Medicare economies to finance the new law .Don’t get me wrong : We need to extract all sensible savings from Medicare and consider revenue increases to ensure its solvency as baby boomers swell its rolls . Thanks to escalating health care costs and repeated sweetening of benefits without commensurate increases in revenues , Medicare was underfinanced by a staggering $ 37 trillion as of Sept. 30 .That’s the amount — about two and a half times the annual output of the United States economy — that would have to be deposited into the Medicare trust funds to adhere to the principle that members of each generation would contribute enough to Medicare while they were working to pay for their care after age 65 .But the politics of Medicare have been poisonous , so toxic that Democrats haven’t been willing to engage seriously on the issue , while Republicans have advanced a proposal that would eviscerate Medicare rather than preserve it .The current effort to trim Medicare costs , through initiatives like limiting payment increases to health care providers , amounts to picking the low-hanging fruit . What comes next will surely be more painful and contentious .Given that context , the government’s accounting practice — counting $ 748 billion of cost savings and $ 259 billion of revenue increases toward both Medicare and the cost of the Obama plan — is particularly troubling . Moreover , this problem is largely hidden from public view .Under Washington’s delusional rules , budget crunchers in both the White House and Congress credit this $ 1 trillion twice : once in calculating that the care law will generate more revenues than costs , and again in concluding that the Obama plan will chip away at the Medicare problem .Unfortunately , the real world does not permit the luxury of double-counting . The truth is that the law will either be fully paid for or it will begin to address the Medicare problem — but not both .There’s no doubt that both parties have similarly gamed the system over the years . Back in 1997 , $ 247 billion of expected Medicare savings was funneled into tax cuts and a children’s health plan as part of a deficit reduction package negotiated by President Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich , the Republican speaker .That bit of history merits close attention , because those efforts to cap reimbursements to providers proved unrealistic and were mostly never realized .While the Obama legislation employs cutting-edge ideas for managing Medicare’s outlays , the program can’t be saved just by squeezing reimbursement rates to hospitals , laboratories and the like . In assessing the new law , the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services warned of exactly these risks .To properly address the competing needs of the Affordable Care Act and Medicare , let’s start with more transparency . The government should act like a company that provides investors with separate profit and loss data for different divisions — without double-counting . Next we need a better plan for financing the health care law , which will be challenging because actually paying for federal programs ( that is , increasing taxes ) has become a no-go zone in Washington .That’s further complicated by the admirably redistributionist nature of the Obama law . The preponderance of the Affordable Care Act’s costs go toward extending insurance coverage to an estimated 30 million Americans making less than $ 44,000 per year ( or $ 89,000 per year for a family of four ) , about 10 percent of the population .Meanwhile , a hefty chunk of the new revenues comes from increased taxes on the earnings and other income ( like dividends and interest ) of affluent individuals , and an excise tax on employers offering so-called Cadillac health plans .It’s fine to ask the wealthiest to pay disproportionately for important social programs . But the top taxpayers , who are already on the hook for around $ 260 billion of the law’s costs , can’t be expected to shoulder the entire $ 1 trillion burden that would flow from intellectually honest accounting .At a time of trillion-dollar deficits , new initiatives must be paid for in reality , not just the world of Washington arithmetic . The effort to curb Medicare costs must continue and accelerate — but all sides need to be more honest by counting these savings just once , not twice .


WashingtonIN the days leading up to the Supreme Court’s health care decision , rumors began to circulate in Washington that the justices had decided to uphold the law . Liberals around town who might have reason to know the outcome seemed happy , according to the gossip , and a couple of conservative justices had seemed angry when the court met three days before the announcement . On the eve of the ruling , a few respected court watchers went so far as to predict publicly that the law would be upheld .It is impossible to know how much of the gossip sprang from actual information . Several dozen people — the justices , their clerks , other members of the court staff — did indeed know the outcome in advance . Although they have a record of discretion exceeding even that of some parts of the national security apparatus , they are human . They have friends and relatives , and they have emotions .With the rumors swirling , I began to check the odds at Intrade , the online prediction market where people can bet on real-world events , several times a day . The odds had barely budged . They continued to show about a 75 percent chance that the law’s so-called mandate would be ruled unconstitutional , right up until the morning it was ruled constitutional .The market — the wisdom of crowds — turned out to be wrong .I have since come to think of the court’s ruling as the signature example of the counterattack of the insiders . After the better part of a decade in which various markets , from Intrade to the stock market , became many people’s preferred way to peer into the future , a backlash is clearly under way . Not so long ago , knowing about the existence of Intrade was a mark of being in the vanguard . Today , mocking Intrade , ideally on Twitter , is a sign of sophistication .This development matters because predictions matter . They allow government officials , corporate executives and citizens to plan for the future . They are an unavoidable part of life .The rise of prediction markets started in the middle of the last decade , brought about by a combination of politics , psychology and technology . The politics came mostly from the aftermath of the Iraq war , when the collective , pro-invasion opinion of Washington experts came to look tragically wrongheaded . The psychology came from a barrage of research , often called behavioral economics , that created a science of human foibles . People were systematically too confident , the research found . They put too much weight on information they liked and too little on data that contradicted their assumptions .The only good alternative to a few flawed opinions , some researchers argued , was a vast number of flawed opinions . The biases often canceled one another out . The legitimate information rose to the surface . It was the wisdom of crowds , as the writer James Surowiecki called his 2004 book .The Internet made collecting the wisdom of crowds vastly easier than before . Intrade , Betfair and other British and Irish betting sites became the public face of prediction markets . Google and other companies started their own internal prediction markets to help them make decisions about where to invest . The Pentagon planned one , to track threats , before deciding it did not like the image of American officials making bets about war and famine .The early successes of prediction markets were notable . To take a small personal example , my wife and I , not exactly frequent moviegoers , twice won money in a large Oscars pool simply by hewing to the British odds . Much more significantly , Intrade was a more reliable guide to the 2006 midterm election than cable networks . On election night , its odds showed that the Democrats had become the favorites to retake the Senate , while television commentators were still telling viewers it was unlikely .But the crowd was not everywhere wise . For one thing , many of the betting pools on Intrade and Betfair attract relatively few traders , in part because using them legally is cumbersome . ( No , I do not know from experience . ) The thinness of these markets can cause them to adjust too slowly to new information .And there is this : If the circle of people who possess information is small enough — as with the selection of a vice president or pope or , arguably , a decision by the Supreme Court — the crowds may not have much wisdom to impart . “There is a class of markets that I think are basically pointless , ” says Justin Wolfers , an economist whose research on prediction markets , much of it with Eric Zitzewitz of Dartmouth , has made him mostly a fan of them . “There is no widely available public information.”These flaws have become fodder for the markets’ critics . On the day of the health care ruling , the widely read financial writers Barry Ritholtz , Felix Salmon and David Wessel all took to Twitter to point out that Intrade looked bad . Tony Fratto , a former aide to President George W. Bush , noted his “real glee” that “Intrade was wrong , again.”But such schadenfreude raises a question : once you accept that prediction markets are flawed , do you turn back to the inside experts ?ALAS , the experts’ overall record remains as poor as the behavioral economists maintained — and often worse than the markets’ record . Mutual fund managers , as a class , lose their clients’ money because they do not outperform the market and charge fees for their mediocrity . Sports pundits have a dismal record of predicting games relative to the Las Vegas odds , which are just another market price . As imperfect as prediction markets are in forecasting elections , they have at least as good a recent record as polls . Or consider the housing bubble : both the market and most experts missed it .The answer , I think , is to take the best of what both experts and markets have to offer , realizing that the combination of the two offers a better window onto the future than either alone . Markets are at their best when they can synthesize large amounts of disparate information , as on an election night . Experts are most useful when a system exists to identify the most truly knowledgeable — a system that often resembles a market .Sometimes , this approach involves a wisdom-of-crowds approach to experts . My colleague Nate Silver , whose book on prediction comes out later this year , has found that a simple average of well-known economic forecasts is substantially more accurate than individual forecasts . Other times , the approach might involve as much art as science — and , again , the Internet allows for strategies that once would have been impossible .Think for a moment about what a Twitter feed is : it’s a personalized market of experts ( and friends ) , in which you can build your own focus group and listen to its collective analysis about the past , present and future . An RSS feed , in which you choose blogs to read , works similarly . You make decisions about which experts are worthy of your attention , based both on your own judgments about them and on other experts’ judgments .Their predictions now face a market discipline that did not always exist before the Internet came along . “Experts exist , ” as Mr. Wolfers says , “but they’re not necessarily the same as the guys on TV.”After several years in which the market was often celebrated as a crystal ball , the Supreme Court ruling was a useful corrective . The prediction-market revolution , like so many others , initially promised more than it could deliver . But it’s not as if the old order was working particularly well .

WASHINGTON â IN the last few days of negotiations in Congress , repeal of the Affordable Care Actâs tax on medical devices emerged as a key Republican demand . The medical-device industry waged an intense lobbying campaign â even garnering the support of many Democrats who favored the law â arguing that the tax would stifle innovation and increase health care costs .This argument is doubly disingenuous . Not only can the medical-device industry easily afford the tax without compromising innovation , but the industryâs enormous profits are a result of anticompetitive practices that themselves drive up medical-device costs unnecessarily . The tax is a distraction from reforms to the industry that are urgently needed to lower health care costs .The medical-device industry faces virtually no price competition . Because of confidentiality agreements that manufacturers require hospitals to sign , the prices of the devices are cloaked in secrecy . This lack of transparency impedes hospitals from sharing price information and thus knowing whether they are getting a good deal .Even worse , manufacturers often maintain personal relationships ( sometimes involving financial payments like consulting fees ) with physicians who choose the medical devices that their hospitals purchase , creating a conflict of interest . Physicians often donât even know the costs of the devices , and individual physicians often choose devices on their own , which weakens a hospitalâs ability to bargain for volume discounts .Such anticompetitive practices help generate a wide variation in the prices of medical devices â and contribute to higher prices in general . For example , the Government Accountability Office found that prices for cardiac implantable medical devices in the United States vary by several thousand dollars . And even the lowest-priced devices in the United States are expensive compared with those in other developed countries . According to the consulting firm McKinsey & Company , the United States spends about 50 percent more than expected on the top five medical devices , compared with Europe and Japan . McKinsey calculates that this amounts to $ 26 billion in excessive spending each year . Medicare , private health insurers and patients end up paying these inflated prices .Excessive prices fuel enormous profits â profits that dwarf both the medical-device tax and the industryâs investments in research and development . Consider the device division of Johnson & Johnson , which in 2012 had an operating profit of $ 7.2 billion . By the companyâs own estimate , the device tax would amount to at most $ 300 million , and its investment in research and development amounts to only $ 1.7 billion .There are several ways policy makers could lower device costs . The first step would be to end the anticompetitive practices that prevent hospitals from getting the best deals . Senator Charles E. Grassley , Republican of Iowa , has sponsored legislation that would foster transparency by posting online price information for implantable medical devices .In addition , instead of simply paying hospitals based in part on what they have spent on devices , Medicare should force manufacturers to compete for business based on a productâs price and quality .Medicare should also pay hospitals a single lump sum for all of the associated costs of a given procedure ( like a hip replacement ) . This approach , known as âbundlingâ the costs , would create incentives for hospitals to lower device costs . Savings should be shared with the physicians , so that their incentives are aligned with the hospitalâs .Bundling has been used successfully in pilot programs . Under Medicareâs Acute Care Episode Program â which bundled payments for cardiac and orthopedic procedures â physicians worked together to choose high-quality , cost-effective devices . Baptist Health System in Texas , which participated in the program , used clinical evidence to choose devices and negotiated lower prices for both Medicare and non-Medicare patients .States could adopt similar payment reforms for private insurance and their Medicaid programs . In Arkansas , the Medicaid program and private payers â including Walmart â have collaborated to adopt bundled payments for several procedures , including hip and knee replacements .To complement these efforts , the new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute , a nongovernmental body created by the Affordable Care Act , should pay for research that compares the effectiveness of devices so physicians can make informed choices . ( Three years into its existence , the institute has initiated few , if any , studies of medical devices . ) Medicare or the Food and Drug Administration should also require the use of registries that track when devices fail .Currently , medical-device manufacturers allocate only a sliver of profits to research and development and often focus on âtweaksâ to existing devices , without providing any evidence that they are of better quality . Competitive pressures from public and private payers would provide incentives for the industry to become more innovative , producing technologies that actually lowered costs and offered truly advanced breakthroughs .Instead of using its clout to lobby against the device tax â which helped foment opposition to the Affordable Care Act â the medical-device industry needs to share the responsibility of lowering costs for patients , businesses and taxpayers .
My post yesterday on the new study of post-Romneycare mortality rates in Massachusetts set up a contrast between two policy scenarios : One in which health insurance expansions have a substantial effect on health ( as the Massachusetts mortality data suggests ) , and another in which insurance’s connection to public health is much more limited ( as the data from the Oregon Medicaid experiment had indicated ) .But there’s also a third possibility , which Avik Roy — who knows the Romneycare story as well as anyone on the right — elaborates on here . It may be , he argues , that private insurance does improve outcomes but Medicaid mostly does not , and that the Massachusetts effect is the result of private coverage expanding in that state much faster than in the country as whole . ( There was also a Medicaid expansion under Romneycare , but it accounted for a very modest portion of the newly-insured . )This is a very important issue , obviously — if Roy is right , then even in the light of the Massachusetts data Republican opposition to the Medicaid expansion isn’t as “deadly” as its liberal critics insist — and it will be interesting to see if we end up with Obamacare-era studies that successfully address it . In terms of policy implications , better outcomes for private insurance would tend to make the case for a reform of Obamacare that privatizes low-income coverage and moves Medicaid beneficiaries onto the exchanges ( as Roy and other conservatives have proposed ) , and against the kind of “Medicaid-for-most” scenario that lies at the end of at least one left-of-center policy path .On the other hand , even if Roy is correct it wouldn’t settle the crucial question of how much private coverage people need to purchase to see significant health gains . If most of the mortality improvements were associated with expensive comprehensive coverage , then migrating people from Medicaid to private insurance would only get you better outcomes at a much steeper fiscal price , which neither party ( and yes , especially the G.O.P . ) is particularly eager to pay .Anyway , we’ll see what the future holds , and what the next big study says . ( And so we beat on , boats against the current , borne back ceaselessly into the health care debate … )
NELSON’S doctors found the bulge in his abdomen on a Monday . An ultrasound and CT scan showed that a mass was crowding out his stomach and kidneys . It was one of the largest the doctors had ever seen . If they didn’t do something , he’d be dead in a couple of days .The hospital gave him a blood transfusion because he was anemic . A radiologist noticed that something might be wrong with his adrenal gland . His surgical team removed what turned out to be a 12.5-pound tumor , lifting it out like an overgrown newborn . Nelson’s intensive care nurse called his family that night , and his internists gave them regular updates until he was discharged .Nelson’s health insurance covered 90 percent of the costs after a reasonable $ 500 deductible . I’m happy he has such good health coverage . He’s my dog . And I’m jealous of him .He has the kind of health care that I’d hoped the Affordable Care Act would usher in for those who , like my wife and me , have to buy health insurance on the open market . I’d long been frustrated at how health care shackles people to corporate jobs . I believed this legislation , signed four years ago this month , would free people to pursue their dreams , start new companies and not worry about the health insurance penalty .What I didn’t count on was that it would make things harder for me and my wife .First , we were notified that we would be kicked out of our existing $ 263-a-month Anthem Blue Cross plan because it didn’t meet the minimum standards of the new law . No problem , I thought . The plans in the new Covered California exchange would most likely be better and cheaper .But we were shocked at what we confronted . The least expensive premium for a couple like us in our 40s would be about $ 620 a month . And because our household adjusted gross income is likely to be over the $ 62,040 cutoff this year , it’s doubtful we’ll end up with a subsidy to help offset that price increase .Having always had insurance , we began to wonder if we might have to go uninsured , but in the end , we enrolled . It’s as if we just bought a new car that we will never see and that we can never pay off .The gulf between my health care world and my dog’s was driven home the other week . I have mild asthma . Normally it’s not a problem , but when I get a chest cold , it becomes severe . One recent day I found that I couldn’t breathe . My inhalers were all expired . I’d held off refilling them since my insurance would reduce the costs of the $ 58.99 inhalers only by a little more than $ 9 . I knew from past experience that I probably needed a prescription for antibiotics , so I tried frantically to find a medical facility that would take our new Covered California Anthem Blue Cross bronze plan . When I did , they said it would be three weeks before I could see a doctor . Instead , I went to the drugstore and bought all the nonprescription medication that might help .Around the same time , Nelson developed a skin infection . I got an appointment at the vet’s the next day . They prescribed an antibiotic and did some blood tests . The medication caused diarrhea so I called his internist at his vet hospital , PetCare , and she prescribed a probiotic . Nelson’s $ 40.42-a-month pet insurance isn’t perfect — for instance it doesn’t cover pre-existing conditions — but it paid almost all of these costs , and the vet followed up to make sure he was doing O.K .I was envious . My 11-year-old brown Labrador was getting the kind of treatment that I could only dream of . I wanted to go to PetCare . I wanted pet insurance .I know that Obamacare is helping a great number of people . I understand that for the first time millions of people are getting health insurance . It’s the one thing that gives me solace .But let’s not pretend that this new policy is the affordable health care savior that many of us were hoping for . For us , our new plan is a big financial hit for a product that does not make it any easier to get basic health care .It’s still hard to understand what coverage we have . It’s like trying to read tea leaves . Benefits descriptions can be contradictory and run nearly 200 pages long . One summary attached to my online account seems to say that if I go to the emergency room , I could potentially owe thousands of dollars . Another document suggests that I’m responsible for only $ 300 . I’ve had two representatives give me two different explanations . The more I questioned these well-intentioned people , the more I realized how confused , overwhelmed and at times plain wrong they were .Here’s what I’ve been able to piece together . Previously , our family deductible totaled $ 13,600 for outpatient care and $ 6,600 for hospital care ( with a maximum combined out-of-pocket cost of $ 13,600 ) . Under our new plan , we have a deductible of $ 10,000 ( and an out-of-pocket maximum of $ 12,700 ) . In both cases , having deductibles that high means this is largely insurance to make sure that we don’t go bankrupt if we become very ill . Yes , the new plan has more coverage , including pediatric vision . But we don’t have children , and I’d trade coverage for things like substance abuse treatment and mental health in return for lower premiums .And if you see a doctor outside your network , look out . We found this out the hard way . My wife and I both had to see a doctor in January . Our old policy and our new Covered California policy were both with Anthem Blue Cross , so a representative there told us to use our old ID cards for our visits since our new cards hadn’t arrived yet . We were covered , he assured us . At the medical center , we gave our ID cards to the receptionist , who accepted them as valid , and went in to see our regular doctors . But later we found out that they were not in our new network’s plan . The out-of-pocket cost for my simple 30-minute office visit : $ 303 . My wife’s annual exam and a couple of minor procedures : $ 918 .We’re still waiting for quality health care that we can actually use , afford and understand — the kind of care that Nelson gets .
FRANKFORT , Ky. â SUNDAY morning news programs identify Kentucky as the red state with two high-profile Republican senators who claim their rhetoric represents an electorate that gave President Obama only about a third of its presidential vote in 2012 .So why then is Kentucky â more quickly than almost any other state â moving to implement the Affordable Care Act ?Because thereâs a huge disconnect between the rank partisanship of national politics and the outlook of governors whose job it is to help beleaguered families , strengthen work forces , attract companies and create a balanced budget .Itâs no coincidence that numerous governors â not just Democrats like me but also Republicans like Jan Brewer of Arizona , John Kasich of Ohio and Rick Snyder of Michigan â see the Affordable Care Act not as a referendum on President Obama but as a tool for historic change .That is especially true in Kentucky , a state where residentsâ collective health has long been horrendous . The state ranks among the worst , if not the worst , in almost every major health category , including smoking , cancer deaths , preventable hospitalizations , premature death , heart disease and diabetes .Weâre making progress , but incremental improvements are not enough . We need big solutions with the potential for transformational change .The Affordable Care Act is one of those solutions .For the first time , we will make affordable health insurance available to every single citizen in the state . Right now , 640,000 people in Kentucky are uninsured . Thatâs almost one in six Kentuckians .Lack of health coverage puts their health and financial security at risk .They roll the dice and pray they donât get sick . They choose between food and medicine . They ignore checkups that would catch serious conditions early . They put off doctorâs appointments , hoping a condition turns out to be nothing . And they live knowing that bankruptcy is just one bad diagnosis away .Furthermore , their children go long periods without checkups that focus on immunizations , preventive care and vision and hearing tests . If they have diabetes , asthma or infected gums , their conditions remain untreated and unchecked .For Kentucky as a whole , the negative impact is similar but larger â jacked-up costs , decreased worker productivity , lower quality of life , depressed school attendance and a poor image .The Affordable Care Act will address these weaknesses .Some 308,000 of Kentuckyâs uninsured â mostly the working poor â will be covered when we increase Medicaid eligibility guidelines to 138 percent of the federal poverty level .PricewaterhouseCoopers and the Urban Studies Institute at the University of Louisville concluded that expanding Medicaid would inject $ 15.6 billion into Kentuckyâs economy over the next eight years , create almost 17,000 new jobs , have an $ 802.4 million positive budget impact ( by transferring certain expenditures from the state to the federal government , among other things ) , protect hospitals from cuts in indigent care funding and shield businesses from up to $ 48 million in annual penalties .In short , we couldnât afford not to do it .The other 332,000 uninsured Kentuckians will be able to access affordable coverage â most with a discount â through the Health Benefit Exchange , the online insurance marketplace we named Kynect : Kentuckyâs Healthcare Connection .Kentucky is the only Southern state both expanding Medicaid and operating a state-based exchange , and we remain on target to meet the Oct. 1 deadline to open Kynect with the support of a call center that is providing some 100 jobs . Having been the first state-based exchange to complete the readiness review with the United States Department of Health and Human Services , we hope to become the first one to be certified .Frankly , we canât implement the Affordable Care Act fast enough .As for naysayers , Iâm offended by their partisan gamesmanship , as they continue to pour time , money and energy into overturning or defunding the Affordable Care Act . Itâs shameful that these critics havenât invested that same level of energy into trying to improve the health of our citizens .They insist that the Affordable Care Act will never work â when in fact a similar approach put into effect in Massachusetts by Mitt Romney , then the governor , is working .So , to those more worried about political power than Kentuckyâs families , I say , âGet over it.âThe Affordable Care Act was approved by Congress and sanctioned by the Supreme Court . It is the law of the land .Get over it ... and get out of the way so I can help my people . Here in Kentucky , we can not afford to waste another day or another life .

Durham , N.C .GIVEN the very real possibility that the Supreme Court will overturn the Affordable Care Act , liberals are concerned that the right-wing tilt of five justices and lifelong appointments ensure a decades-long assault on the power of Congress . This is especially likely given the relative youth of the bloc’s conservative members : an average of 66 years old , when the last 10 justices to retire did so at an average age of 78 .The situation brings to mind a proposal voiced most prominently by Gov . Rick Perry during his run for the Republican presidential nomination : judicial term limits .The idea isn’t new . High-ranking judges in all major nations , and all 50 states , are subject to age or term limits . The power to invalidate legislation is , in a sense , the ultimate political power , and mortals who exercise it need constraint . So why not the highest court in the land ?One reason sometimes given is that Congress could not enact strict limits without amending Article III of the Constitution , which provides that justices hold office for the period of their “good behavior.” Long lives were uncommon in 1788 , so the issue of prolonged service was not considered by the framers .Instead , they simply borrowed the term “good behavior” from a law enacted by the English Parliament in 1701 to deter a king dissatisfied with a judicial decision from firing the judge who made it . Interestingly , that same Parliament has long since imposed age limits on its nation’s judges — as has virtually every national constitution written since 1789 .Indeed , Mr. Perry wasn’t the first person to propose adjusting the political powers of our highest court , nor is the idea an exclusively conservative one . In 2009 a politically diverse group of law professors , including me , proposed a system that would work around the need to amend the Constitution — an extremely unlikely possibility — yet still capture the benefits of term limits .Here’s how our plan would work . Every two years the president would appoint a new justice to the court , but only the nine most junior justices , by years of service , would sit and decide every case .The rest would then act as a sort of “bench” team , sitting on cases as needed because of the disability or disqualification of one of the junior justices . These senior justices might also help decide which of the thousands of petitions the court receives each year should be fully considered , vote on procedural rulemaking , and perhaps sit on occasional cases presented to lower circuit courts .In short , our proposal would revise the job of a justice to a more human scale and perhaps make the court less likely to impose erratic political preferences on the citizens it governs . Because it would assure regular turnover , the court would experience fewer long-term ideological swings , enabling it to better do its original job of anchoring the legislative process to the Constitution .The founders clearly intended to confer on Congress the power to define the number and role of justices . The Judiciary Act of 1789 set the number of justices at seven and imposed on them the duty to travel the nation in horse-drawn wagons to hear and decide cases .In 1800 the Federalists reduced the size of the court in an effort to deny President Jefferson an opportunity to make an appointment . The number rose to 10 during the Civil War to prevent those sympathizing with the Confederacy from doing harm to the Union .In 1937 , when the court was invalidating New Deal legislation , Congress considered a law adding justices , but the bill was defeated when the need for it was eliminated ( one justice unexpectedly upheld a challenged law ; another anti-New Deal justice retired ) .If five of our present justices broadly prohibit the federal government from providing accessible health care , Congress should consider using its constitutional power again to add two more justices — and impose a reasonable limit on the length of time that a mere mortal should hold so much political power .


MILLIONS of Americans negotiating Americaâs health care system know all too well what the waiting room of a doctorâs office looks like . Now , thanks to HealthCare.gov , they know what a âvirtual waiting roomâ looks like , too . Nearly 20 million Americans , in fact , have visited the Web site since it opened three weeks ago , but only about 500,000 managed to complete applications for insurance coverage . And an even smaller subset of those applicants actually obtained coverage .For the first time in history , a president has had to stand in the Rose Garden to apologize for a broken Web site . But HealthCare.gov is only the latest episode in a string of information technology debacles by the federal government . Indeed , according to the research firm the Standish Group , 94 percent of large federal information technology projects over the past 10 years were unsuccessful â more than half were delayed , over budget , or didnât meet user expectations , and 41.4 percent failed completely .For example , Sam.gov , a system for government contractors developed by I.B.M . that started in 2012 , has cost taxpayers $ 181 million and is just now beginning to work as expected . Before that , a new version of USAJobs.gov landed with a thud , after years during which millions were spent . In 2001 , the F.B.I . started a virtual case file system , and after dumping the project , renaming it , and finding new vendors to build it , the project , âSentinel , â managed to see the light of day just last year .Clearly , these failures â though they are not as well known to the public â extend far beyond Barack Obamaâs presidency . But this latest stings more than the others . Perhaps thatâs because it comes from a president who is seen as a transformational figure , who has had to watch his signature achievement be held hostage by that most banal of captors : a clunky computer system .So why is it that the technology available to Mr. Obama as president doesnât compare to the technology he used to win an election ? Much of the problem has to do with the way the government buys things . The government has to follow a code called the Federal Acquisition Regulation , which is more than 1,800 pages of legalese that all but ensure that the companies that win government contracts , like the ones put out to build HealthCare.gov , are those that can navigate the regulations best , but not necessarily do the best job . Thatâs evidenced by yesterdayâs Congressional testimony by the largest of the vendors , CGI Federal , which blamed everyone but itself when asked to explain the botched rollout of the new Web site .But maybe thereâs hope . In 2004 , campaign contracting was a lot like government contracting is today : full of large , entrenched vendors providing subpar services . Howard Dean changed that by reaching out to a new breed of Internet-savvy companies and staffers ( including one of us ) . In 2012 , Barack Obama beat Mitt Romney thanks in part to a mix of private-sector-trained technology workers and a well-developed ecosystem of technologies available from competitive consultants .This latest failure is frustrating for us to watch . Our careers have largely been about developing technology that allows more people to participate in the way we finance , support and elect candidates for public office . Together , weâve done things that transformed elections , but we now need that work to carry into transforming government .Government should be as participatory and as interactive with its citizens as our political process is . A digital candidate will never be able to become a digital president if he canât bring the innovation that helped him win election into the Oval Office to help him govern .HealthCare.gov needs to be fixed . We believe that in a few days it will be . As Mr. Obama said last week after the government shutdown ended , âThereâs no good reason why we canât govern responsibly , despite our differences , without lurching from manufactured crisis to manufactured crisis.â Thereâs no good reason we canât code responsibly , either . We must find a fix to the federal procurement process that spares the governmentâs technology projects from the self-inflicted wounds of signing big contracts whose terms repeatedly and spectacularly go unmet .The good news is that these problems are not unique to the United States government , and others already have solutions . In 2011 , the British government formed a new unit of its Cabinet Office called the Government Digital Service . Itâs a team of internal technologists whose job it is to either build the right technology , or find the right vendors for every need across the government . It gives the government a technical brain . It has saved the country millions , and improved the way the government delivers services online .The United States has taken a step in this direction . Last year , the governmentâs chief technology officer , Todd Park , started the Presidential Innovation Fellows program and brought together innovators from across the country to work on hard technical problems inside of government . But we need to create our own Government Digital Service .The president should use the power of the White House to end all large information technology purchases , and instead give his administrationâs accomplished technologists the ability to work with agencies to make the right decisions , increase adoption of modern , incremental software development practices , like a popular one called Agile , already used in the private sector , and work with the Small Business Administration and the General Services Administration to make it easy for small businesses to contract with the government .Large federal information technology purchases have to end . Any methodology with a 94 percent chance of failure or delay , which costs taxpayers billions of dollars , doesnât belong in a 21st-century government .
Most of the news coverage of the highly-anticipated contraceptive-mandate cases — which came before the Supreme Court on Tuesday morning — has focused on the idea of religious liberty , and to what degree a for-profit corporation can exercise that liberty like a real human person .But the real human persons at the center of the case — specifically , the women whose access to contraception is at stake — were notably absent from much of the conversation in the court . The case ( actually two cases consolidated into one ) arose after several businesses sued the federal government over the Affordable Care Act’s requirement that they either provide their employees with comprehensive health insurance , which includes coverage for contraception , or pay a tax .The businesses’ owners are opposed for religious reasons to any contraceptive method that acts after an embryo has formed . Since some of the methods approved under the health-care law can work in that way , the owners charged that the government was violating their right to the free exercise of religion .At oral argument , there were plenty of questions over what precise legal standards to apply in the case ; how far the plaintiffs’ logic extended ( would it allow corporations to refuse to cover , say , vaccinations or blood transfusions ? ) ; and what would be the cost of the various choices available to the companies .More than half an hour of argument passed before Justice Anthony Kennedy , playing his familiar role somewhere between the liberal and conservative blocs on the court , brought the actual women into the picture . “How would you suggest that we think about the position and the rights of the employees ? ” Justice Kennedy asked Paul Clement , the attorney for the corporate plaintiffs . “The employee may not agree with these religious beliefs of the employer . Does the religious beliefs just trump ? Is that the way it works ? ”Until then , you might have thought that the only human beings who would be affected by the court’s decision were the owners of the companies themselves : Hobby Lobby Stores , Inc. , an Oklahoma-based arts-and-crafts chain owned by evangelical Christians , and Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp. , a Mennonite cabinet manufacturer from Pennsylvania .But Hobby Lobby alone has 13,000 employees , a significant portion of whom are women , or men with female partners who share their insurance . It is safe to assume that many if not most of them have used contraception . And contrary to Justice Antonin Scalia’s dismissive suggestion that cost isn’t a factor ( “That’s not terribly expensive stuff , is it ? ” he said at one point ) the four methods at issue in the Hobby Lobby cases , such as IUDs , are among the most effective — and expensive . According to an amicus brief filed by reproductive-health experts , one third of American women say they would change their method of contraception if cost weren’t an issue .In other words , Hobby Lobby’s decision not to provide insurance coverage could make it harder for its female employees to obtain basic health services now freely available to other women throughout the country .Of course , as Justice Kennedy knew when he asked about employee rights , any claim of religious liberty must be considered in the context of the possible burden that liberty imposes on other citizens . Solicitor General Donald Verrilli , who argued the case on behalf of the government , tried to make this point the centerpiece of his case from his opening words .“Limitations which of necessity bound religious freedom begin to operate whenever activities begin to affect or collide with the liberties of others or of the public , ” Mr. Verrilli said , quoting Justice Robert Jackson from a 1944 case .Mr. Verrilli argued that the employees’ right to a legally guaranteed health benefit was “left on the sidelines” by the plaintiffs .Despite his best efforts , for a good part of the morning it was left on the sidelines by the Supreme Court justices as well .
A CLOSE vote by a split electorate has handed President Obama a second term . He steps up , revived and renewed , to preside over a divided nation that often seems to agree on only one thing : today’s children will live less well than their parents . This pervasive loss of confidence , though hard to precisely measure , is of enormous consequence . It’s what sinks civilizations .Mr. Obama understands this , but hasn’t fashioned a coherent response — and it nearly resulted in his defeat . The problem was starkly visible to 70 million viewers in that disastrous first debate when Mitt Romney showed many voters that he was confident about the future of the country . Mr. Obama seemed at a loss , conflicted and hesitant , as though he’d been found out .To understand what was happening behind that lectern and the challenge Mr. Obama faces in his new term , it’s useful to consider what the president told me in a February 2011 interview in the Oval Office . Mr. Obama spoke of a president’s power to instill confidence in the people as something of a coin of the realm .Citing Franklin D. Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy , he talked about how both men , regardless of their policies , were masterly at helping Americans “believe in themselves.” Ronald Reagan , he said with a hint of envy , “was very comfortable in playing the role of president , ” with his actor’s background .The president summed up what he’d learned after an optimism-bruising two years in office : “I think where the evolution has taken place , ” he said , “is understanding that leadership in this office is not a matter of you being confident . Leadership in this office is a matter of helping the American people feel confident.”Exuding confidence while not feeling it ? That straddle is particularly difficult for Mr. Obama , who’s long wrestled with a dual role as appraising narrator , with those writerly skills , and main actor in the great play of events . Reconciling that split is what held him back in the campaign and left him tongue-tied when he tried to paint an alluring vision of the future . Obama the Narrator wouldn’t let Obama the Actor sell a confidence he didn’t feel , even if it’s what people were yearning for .Now , the re-elected president must find some way to tell us how he , and the country , can rightfully feel optimistic .To manage it , Mr. Obama will have to evolve . How ? Speak from the heart and then act . It’s dangerous for anyone , even someone who published his autobiography at 33 , fashioning a personal narrative that helped propel him to the presidency , to be so fixated on the storyteller’s third-person view , which looks down from the ceiling . It slows one’s step and adds a level of calculation — of how things will play — that undermines improvisations , the lightning reactions , the twists and surprises of a more dynamic leadership . It’s the difference between writing about history and shaping it .Focusing on legacy , which is the endgame of the story , Mr. Obama has often missed what’s happening before his eyes . The great mishap of the first term was failing to direct , as a new president with a sky-high approval rating , a sea of enthusiasts . After all , before the Tea Party arose , there was an army many times its size — Obama’s Army — that he abandoned , leaving a tattered remnant that , in 2011 , supported Occupy Wall Street . By then , the Tea Party had been embraced by Republicans and become an electoral force ; still , Mr. Obama kept Occupy Wall Street at arm’s length .He now has won a new first 100 days . In hopes of harvesting a few lessons , it’s worthwhile to note what he did the first time , with all that political capital . Thinking of his legacy — the passage of health care reform — he missed opportunities presented by the twin crises of a collapsing economy and the banking meltdown to restructure the American financial system . He did not push for the creation of a sound and sustainable foundation for investing , in place of speculative trading . Then , by failing to use Obama’s Army to drive the health care debate , he ceded ground to the Tea Party and had to limp across the finish line , a year later , with only a starting point for comprehensive health care reform — really , a widened coverage mandate by government .Maybe Mr. Obama will feel the valuable bite of those early , missed opportunities in the weeks to come , as he has to negotiate terms to avoid the looming “fiscal cliff” and the demands of Tea Party representatives . We have , indisputably , entered an age of wild participatory energies , bubbling up and driving a kind of relentless direct democracy . These voices will write the narrative for the coming days . And they’re looking for a lead actor .In our interview on that wintry day in 2011 , Mr. Obama said that the key thing a president should do “is tell a story to the American people” — something he said again to Charlie Rose this past summer . As someone who’s been writing narratives for a few decades , I can’t help but think of the standard told to generations of reporters : show , don’t tell .Don’t tell the story . Be the story , of a president who both rode and guided history’s wave and fairly earned that coin of the realm : confidence .
Alert ( or at least health-care-obsessed ) readers have no doubt been following the coverage of a new study on mortality in Massachusetts in the years following Romneycare’s coverage expansion , the gist of which — the authors found a striking , Massachusetts-specific decline in death rates for the non-elderly — tends to confirm liberal assumptions about the benefits of health insurance , and undercut the conservative and libertarian argument that insurance doesn’t have the impact on health and mortality that most people expect . The study’s findings are an almost-diametrical reversal of the results from Oregon’s Medicaid experiment , which were much discussed around this time last year ( here’s my contribution ) , and which seemed to strengthen the conservative critique of Obamacare’s pursuit of comprehensive coverage . So now it’s liberalism’s turn to claim vindication , and to press Obamacare’s critics to give ground in the debate .And some ground-giving is appropriate . Megan McArdle , among right-of-center writers , has probably written most extensively on the insurance-and-health question , so I think her response to the new study deserves to be quoted at length:… here’s my basic take : The study looks pretty good . It is hard to reconcile these results with Oregon . Good Bayesians will update their beliefs accordingly .… I can think of reasons to believe Oregon rather than Massachusetts : It’s a real [ randomized controlled trial ] , rather than a comparison of counties that are supposed to be similar but might not actually have been in practice . There are surprising results that might be red flags about the data : For instance , cancer mortality dropped , even though the study only ran four years . If the benefit is coming from early detection , I would expect it to take longer to have a significant impact on the data … Massachusetts also has differently sized samples — the control group has about 10 times the population of the treatment group . Since larger groups should tend to have less variance , this might increase the odds of getting a surprisingly good or surprisingly bad result with your treatment group .Most worrying is the period they compared : 2007 to 2010 … The authors are not stupid ; they control for unemployment and poverty . But if the financial crisis affected Massachusetts differently from the rest of the country — and it did — then that may well show up in mortality in ways that are hard to measure .That said , I can also think of reasons to believe Massachusetts over Oregon . The treatment group sample is smaller than the control group by quite a lot , but it’s still huge by comparison with Oregon : 3,900,000 rather than around 6,000 . And Massachusetts is a single comprehensive system , unlike Medicaid , which people might drop in and out of as their income changes , dampening the effect of insurance . The authors find mortality that’s amenable to treatment dropping more rapidly than overall mortality . And comparisons with nearby counties , and with the state’s elderly population , also deliver the same result .So what should we believe ? I haven’t changed my beliefs radically : I still basically think that health insurance improves mortality rates , but that that improvement is unlikely to be huge if you can get results like Oregon . However , after yesterday’s report , I’ve revised the probability of “huge benefits” upward , and you should do the same . And beware of those who are only willing to revise their beliefs in one direction .I completely agree , and I would only add the following point : To the extent that we should revise up the potential health benefits of insurance , we should revise down the extent to which the most rigorous conservative alternative to Obamacare — a reform that would shift the system toward flat , universal subsidies for catastrophic coverage — represents a kind of public policy free ( or at least relatively-inexpensive ) lunch . That is , if the preponderance of the evidence suggests that insurance’s health benefits are relatively limited , policymakers can hope to reap the cost-containing benefits of bigger co-pays and higher deductibles and health savings accounts without worrying too much that they’re creating gaping chasms between the care people need and the care they can afford and get . But if the Massachusetts study , rather than the Medicaid data or the famous RAND health insurance experiment , gets closer to the typical reality of what a health insurance expansion does , then policymakers are faced with a more explicit trade-off , in which what’s saved through market forces by giving people more responsibility for their own health spending has to be balanced against what’s lost in foregone care and treatment . And while having that trade-off suddenly look a lot starker than it has to date wouldn’t settle the overall debate , it would give liberals a stronger case for their approach .As I noted in an earlier post , the mortality issue is one of several plausible metrics for assessing whether Obamacare succeeds or disappoints , and because of the variance in coverage expansions between red and blue states , presumably researchers will be able to push further on this question over the next five or ten years , and the evidence on one side or the other will look more dispositive . Right now , I would only offer a word of caution for liberals , who are ( understandably ) folding this study together with other positive data points ( falling uninsured numbers in Gallup’s polling , a brighter deficit picture , good news on some specific policy targets ) to make a case that the empirically-driven conservative critique of Obamacare is in the early stages of collapse .For all we know it might be , but the reality is that on most questions — mortality , deficits , cost containment , and coverage — we are by definition years away from remotely dispositive assessments . The Massachusetts research is only significant because the authors had years of post-Romney data to examine ; going forward , on just about every metric that matters for Obamacare , we’re looking at a similar timeframe for meaningful numbers and outcomes and results . So if either side , on any of these issues , is going to need to give substantial ground , the only intellectually-responsible way to do it will be … slowly .
THE Obama administration has made a curious strategic choice in its defense of the constitutionality of the health care reform act . The central issue before the Supreme Court , which will begin hearing oral arguments on Monday , is whether the act’s requirement that everyone buy health insurance — the so-called individual mandate — exceeds Congress’s constitutional power .The act’s other provisions regulating health insurance — like the requirement that health insurance companies take all applicants , regardless of pre-existing illnesses , and the prohibition against charging sicker patients higher rates — have not been challenged . And yet the administration is arguing that the individual mandate is not “severable” from these regulations ; if the mandate falls , they must as well , and health insurance companies would once again be free to choose whom to cover .But if the court were to strike down the individual mandate , it should stop there : that would be quite bold enough . The Supreme Court has long affirmed a “presumption in favor of severability , ” meaning that when it rules that a statutory provision is unconstitutional , the decision should affect as little of the law as possible . As Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said , while speaking for the court in 2010 , making more extensive changes would constitute “editorial freedom” that “belongs to the legislature , not the judiciary.”It is Congress , not the court , that has the constitutional power and responsibility to make difficult legislative policy decisions like these . By arguing against severability , the Obama administration — and the law’s opponents , who are making an even more radical claim — is urging the Supreme Court to abandon its tradition of judicial restraint , to ignore longstanding precedents and to undermine the separation of powers .Perhaps it comes as no surprise that the opponents of the law , which they call “Obamacare , ” agree with the administration on this crucial point . They have even urged the Supreme Court to strike down the entire statute , including the act’s many provisions that have nothing to do with health insurance coverage , like those relating to doctor training and the regulation of certain drugs . They would like nothing more than for the court to save Congress the trouble of having to muster the votes to try to repeal the law .To this end , the law’s opponents have advanced several specious arguments . Because the act is so complex , they say , the court does not have the expertise to decide whether only one provision can be excised from it . In addition , because the statute was the product of hard-fought political compromise , every provision was necessary to secure a majority of votes , and the removal of any one would upset the delicate deal that was struck .But complexity is a key reason for the severability doctrine in the first place : it is Congress that has the expertise and responsibility to decide what should be kept absent the individual mandate . And virtually every statute reflects a bundle of political deals . If either of these arguments is accepted , it would destroy the doctrine of severability entirely .Both the Obama administration and the law’s opponents have one argument in common . They express concern about what might happen to health insurance markets if the mandate is severed from the statute but the requirements that insurance companies cover sick patients and don’t charge them higher rates remain . If healthy people do not have to buy insurance and insurance companies are forced to cover the sick , they warn , insurance would be far more expensive . No doubt rates would rise as a result . But the size of that increase — whether it would be 10 percent or 20 percent , as some claim — is unknown , and the Supreme Court is in no position to make that judgment on its own .It’s not clear why the Obama administration has chosen this course . Perhaps it made a strategic choice to raise the stakes of striking down the mandate by asking the court to also invalidate the law’s more popular provisions . Or it may be concerned that , if the mandate alone is struck down , there would not be enough votes in Congress to pass new provisions to compensate the insurance industry for its loss . But as a legal matter , the court should reject the argument .We believe that imposing the mandate was within Congress’s powers to regulate commerce and that the legislation should be upheld . But if the Supreme Court strikes the mandate down , the rest of the law should stand , and Congress should have to decide what happens next .Why should an unelected court free the insurance industry from having to do its own political lobbying work in Congress ? Why should the court choose whether or not to deny injured and sick Americans health insurance ? These crucial decisions must be left to our elected officials , who — unlike the Supreme Court — can then be held accountable for them by the voting public .
On Monday , I wrote that the apparent stabilization of Obamacare sharpens the political and policy challenge facing the law’s critics . Instead of the sort of easy unraveling that some Republicans had convinced themselves was in the offing , I argued ( in a point made rather more forcefully by Ramesh Ponnuru ) that it’s now much more likely that the only way the things conservatives dislike about Obamacare will ever change or go away is if conservatives actually unite around reforms or a replacement that sustains some of the current law’s coverage expansion ( albeit on significantly different terms ) .My sense is that some Republicans half-agree . That is , they’re willing to concede that the party needs an Obamacare replacement that’s more serious than some of the G.O.P.’s circa-2009 alternatives . But they also think the law will remain so unpopular , and that the number of losers will exceed the number of winners so dramatically , that conservative policymakers will have more room to maneuver , in terms of the initial coverage numbers a replacement might sustain , than my reading of the situation would suggest .The health care reform proposal rolled out by Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal this week offers a specific example of how this perspective cashes out . Unlike some other recent Republican proposals ( most notably , the bill co-sponsored in the Senate earlier this year ) , which promise tax cuts and savings relative to current policy , Jindal’s proposal explicitly starts with the 2008 baseline , and promises not to tax or spend a dollar more . His proposed reform would convert the open-ended deduction for employer-provided insurance into a flat deduction , extend the same deduction to people outside the employer market , and channel $ 100 billion over ten years to the states to provide for high-risk pools and other measures to help cover people with pre-existing conditions . What it conspicuously wouldn’t do is create the kind of tax credit for catastrophic coverage that you’ll often find in right-of-center health care alternatives — because that would cost money relative to the 2008 baseline , and/or require further disruptions elsewhere in the system . Which means , in turn , that if you replaced Obamacare with Jindalcare in 2017 , you’d see a coverage expansion relative to the Bush era , but a large number of the newly-insured would lose coverage without any immediate prospect of regaining it .Jindal was in D.C. yesterday to talk about his plan ( full disclosure , I was there ) , and the Washington Examiner’s Philip Klein has a good write-up of how he responded to , shall we say , pushback on this point:Jindal was pressed on why he chose to offer a tax deduction for individuals to purchase insurance rather than a refundable tax credit . Supporters of the tax credit approach argue that it would benefit more people , because lower-income Americans don’t pay enough taxes for the deduction to be valuable enough to make insurance premiums affordable .He said that he decided on the deduction approach because relying on tax credits would be so costly that it would require tax increases – and Jindal doesn’t want his plan to spend more or tax more than the system that existed prior to Obamacare’s passage . He also argued that credits would cause more disruption to the employer-based market and would be more prone to fraud .He said that whatever amounts of money conservatives were willing to allocate to address a problem , Democrats would always be willing to spend more , so conservatives can not get into a bidding war .Jindal cited previous estimates of similar reform proposals to his own , which he said could reduce family health insurance premiums by $ 5,000 annually and increase coverage by 9 million people relative to the number of people who were covered prior to Obamacare .“I don’t think conservative health care reform is about saying we’re going to compete with them in terms of how many people we say have an insurance card , ” he said . “That’s not the ultimate goal.”So obviously the governor and I have a substantive disagreement here : Like Jindal , I’m deeply skeptical of the “give everyone a Medicaid card” approach to health care reform , but that skepticism pushes me toward supporting a basic catastrophic protection ( and other reforms ) instead , rather than toward just accepting , for the foreseeable future , a health insurance marketplace that prices a lot of working class Americans out of affordable coverage of any sort .But for the purposes of this post , I’m more interested in the politics of the debate . Politically , I don’t think there’s any question that Jindal’s argument — go back to the pre-Obamacare baseline , expand coverage modestly relative to that — would play well with at least part of the G.O.P . electorate in a primary campaign . For a case , contra myself and Ponnuru , that it could also play pretty well in the general election and in a subsequent legislative battle , here’s Ben Domenech , writing in yesterday’s edition of his newsletter The Transom:… when President Obama sold his health care law to the American people , he sold it to them primarily on the basis of cost . He did this because the polling was so unanimous : people weren’t demanding massive increased regulation of the insurance marketplace to achieve any particular moral goal about coverage levels or anything of the sort – the vast majority of Americans just cared that their premiums cost too much . So Obama made the case for his law based not on increasing coverage , but on decreasing costs – and along the way , he promised that no one would lose their doctor , their plan , or see worse coverage because of his law . In each case , his case was in line with the polling data on what the American people wanted .But what about making the case for health policy reforms in the post-Obamacare era ? For most center-right health policy experts and opinion-makers , the assumption has taken hold that coverage levels must be sustained or even increased under any comparable reform . They believe the argument in favor of universal coverage has been lost , and that any plan which kicks people off of an entitlement program is doomed to fail , politically .This is an assumption held by most people in Washington and the media . But I wonder how accurate it is . Post-Obamacare polling data on this question is lacking , but given the behavior of so many individuals and entities in reaction to Obamacare it’s possible that the bulk of Americans still hold the same views they did prior to the law’s passage : that they want to retain their current plans , that they dislike disruption in their insurance experience , but that most of all , they want lower costs for themselves , not broader coverage for everybody else .I agree that support for universal coverage has tended to be soft , rising when it seems theoretical and then diminishing when the trade-offs actually present themselves . But my expectation is that with Obamacare in place , the psychology of loss aversion changes this calculus in two ways . First , indirectly — because it seems worse to most people to lose a benefit than to have never enjoyed it , voters will feel more morally uncomfortable supporting a candidate who promises to strip other people’s coverage than they would have felt voting for a candidate who opposed the expansion originally . And second , directly — because over the next few years , even voters who dislike Obamacare and aren’t getting subsidies are likely to internalize the idea that they now have an additional backstop in the event of job-loss or illness , and so voting to roll the program back completely and start afresh without that backstop will , again , be more unpopular than never creating it in the first place would have been . ( The consistent presence , in most polls , of an anti-Obamacare demographic that prefer changes to outright repeal suggests to me that the idea of maintaining some kind of quasi-universal guarantee has relatively strong appeal . )I’d also make a broader point : Yes , the health care law remains unpopular , but it was unpopular in 2012 as well , and the economy was worse , and the Republican nominee still went down to defeat — not least , I would submit , because of the perception that he couldn’t be trusted to safeguards the interests of the non-rich . So even if people generally care more about cost than coverage , it still seems quite likely that this fatal impression of the party’s priorities would be accentuated , rather than diminished , in a 2016 campaign where the Republican nominee would be quite directly promising to drive the uninsured rate up .My expectation could be confounded , I concede , if the next few years are a true disaster of spiking premiums and stagnant newly-insured numbers . And I would certainly agree with Domenech that the structure of the law is a lot more vulnerable than exuberant liberals seem to think this week .But I also think that in political terms , it’s actually slightly crazy for Republicans to bet this way given the other options available to them . The Jindal theory , that the right shouldn’t bother competing with liberals on certain policy fronts because they’ll always be outbid , is generally problematic ( why does his proposal have any coverage expansion , then ? ) but it’s a particularly odd idea to embrace in a case where the liberal program may not , as even its defenders allow , actually end up delivering the scale of coverage expansion that was expected .By which I mean that if the current enrollment trends persist , there is a good chance that some version of a more catastrophic-focused reform could actually enroll somewhat more Americans in some kind of basic coverage than Obamacare , at a substantially lower cost . ( A preliminary private score of the Senate Republican bill suggested it could get slightly higher coverage numbers , and that was — I believe — using the C.B.O . projections for Obamacare , which may turn out to have been too high . ) Which in turn would offer Republicans an opportunity to effectively outbid the Democrats on enrollment while significantly underbidding them on spending . ( The Democrats could , of course , counter with single-payer — but the G.O.P . should want to provoke that debate ! ) And to pass up that unusual opportunity in favor of a probably-doomed fidelity to a nearly decade-old baseline … well , I suppose it would be very much like the Republican Party I’ve come to know and love so well .
TODAY marks the beginning of health care coverage under the Affordable Care Act’s new insurance exchanges , for which two million Americans have signed up . Now that the individual mandate is officially here , let me begin with an admission : Obamacare is awful .That is the dirty little secret many liberals have avoided saying out loud for fear of aiding the president’s enemies , at a time when the ideal of universal health care needed all the support it could get . Unfortunately , this meant that instead of blaming companies like Novartis , which charges leukemia patients $ 90,000 annually for the drug Gleevec , or health insurance chief executives like Stephen Hemsley of UnitedHealth Group , who made nearly $ 102 million in 2009 , for the sky-high price of American health care , the president’s Democratic supporters bought into the myth that it was all those people going to get free colonoscopies and chemotherapy for the fun of it .I believe Obamacare’s rocky start — clueless planning , a lousy website , insurance companies raising rates , and the president’s telling people they could keep their coverage when , in fact , not all could — is a result of one fatal flaw : The Affordable Care Act is a pro-insurance-industry plan implemented by a president who knew in his heart that a single-payer , Medicare-for-all model was the true way to go . When right-wing critics “expose” the fact that President Obama endorsed a single-payer system before 2004 , they’re actually telling the truth .What we now call Obamacare was conceived at the Heritage Foundation , a conservative think tank , and birthed in Massachusetts by Mitt Romney , then the governor . The president took Romneycare , a program designed to keep the private insurance industry intact , and just improved some of its provisions . In effect , the president was simply trying to put lipstick on the dog in the carrier on top of Mitt Romney’s car . And we knew it .By 2017 , we will be funneling over $ 100 billion annually to private insurance companies . You can be sure they’ll use some of that to try to privatize Medicare .For many people , the “affordable” part of the Affordable Care Act risks being a cruel joke . The cheapest plan available to a 60-year-old couple making $ 65,000 a year in Hartford , Conn. , will cost $ 11,800 in annual premiums . And their deductible will be $ 12,600 . If both become seriously ill , they might have to pay almost $ 25,000 in a single year . ( Pre-Obamacare , they could have bought insurance that was cheaper but much worse , potentially with unlimited out-of-pocket costs . )And yet — I would be remiss if I didn’t say this — Obamacare is a godsend . My friend Donna Smith , who was forced to move into her daughter’s spare room at age 52 because health problems bankrupted her and her husband , Larry , now has cancer again . As she undergoes treatment , at least she won’t be in terror of losing coverage and becoming uninsurable . Under Obamacare , her premium has been cut in half , to $ 456 per month .Let’s not take a victory lap yet , but build on what there is to get what we deserve : universal quality health care .Those who live in red states need the benefit of Medicaid expansion . It may have seemed like smart politics in the short term for Republican governors to grab the opportunity offered by the Supreme Court rulings that made Medicaid expansion optional for states , but it was long-term stupid : If those 20 states hold out , they will eventually lose an estimated total of $ 20 billion in federal funds per year — money that would be going to hospitals and treatment .In blue states , let’s lobby for a public option on the insurance exchange — a health plan run by the state government , rather than a private insurer . In Massachusetts , State Senator James B. Eldridge is trying to pass a law that would set one up . Some counties in California are also trying it . Montana came up with another creative solution . Gov . Brian Schweitzer , a Democrat who just completed two terms , set up several health clinics to treat state workers , with no co-pays and no deductibles . The doctors there are salaried employees of the state of Montana ; their only goal is their patients’ health . ( If this sounds too much like big government to you , you might like to know that Google , Cisco and Pepsi do exactly the same . )All eyes are on Vermont’s plan for a single-payer system , starting in 2017 . If it flies , it will change everything , with many states sure to follow suit by setting up their own versions . That’s why corporate money will soon flood into Vermont to crush it . The legislators who’ll go to the mat for this will need all the support they can get : If you live east of the Mississippi , look up the bus schedule to Montpelier .So let’s get started . Obamacare can’t be fixed by its namesake . It’s up to us to make it happen .
WashingtonIF Mitt Romney’s pivots on President’s Obama’s health care reform act have accelerated to a blur — from repealing on Day 1 , to preserving this or that piece , to punting the decision to the states — it is for an odd reason buried beneath two and a half years of Republican political condemnations : the architecture of the Affordable Care Act is based on conservative , not liberal , ideas about individual responsibility and the power of market forces .This fundamental ideological paradox , drowned out by partisan shouting since before the plan’s passage in 2010 , explains why Obamacare has only lukewarm support from many liberals , who wanted a real , not imagined , “government takeover of health care.” It explains why Republicans have been unable since its passage to come up with anything better . And it explains why the law is nearly identical in design to the legislation Mr. Romney passed in Massachusetts while governor .The core drivers of the health care act are market principles formulated by conservative economists , designed to correct structural flaws in our health insurance system — principles originally embraced by Republicans as a market alternative to the Clinton plan in the early 1990s . The president’s program extends the current health care system — mostly employer-based coverage , administered by commercial health insurers , with care delivered by fee-for-service doctors and hospitals — by removing the biggest obstacles to that system’s functioning like a competitive marketplace .Chief among these obstacles are market limitations imposed by the problematic nature of health insurance , which requires that younger , healthier people subsidize older , sicker ones . Because such participation is often expensive and always voluntary , millions have simply opted out , a risky bet emboldened by the 24/7 presence of the heavily subsidized emergency room down the street . The health care law forcibly repatriates these gamblers , along with those who can not afford to participate in a market that ultimately cross-subsidizes their medical misfortunes anyway , when they get sick and show up in that E.R . And it outlaws discrimination against those who want to participate but can not because of their medical histories . Put aside the considerable legislative detritus of the act , and its aim is clear : to rationalize a dysfunctional health insurance marketplace .This explains why the health insurance industry has been quietly supporting the plan all along . It levels the playing field and expands the potential market by tens of millions of new customers .The rationalization and extension of the current market is financed by the other linchpin of the law : the mandate that we all carry health insurance , an idea forged not by liberal social engineers at the Brookings Institution but by conservative economists at the Heritage Foundation . The individual mandate recognizes that millions of Americans who could buy health insurance choose not to , because it requires trading away today’s wants for tomorrow’s needs . The mandate is about personal responsibility — a hallmark of conservative thought .IN the partisan war sparked by the 2008 election , Republicans conveniently forgot that this was something many of them had supported for years . The only thing wrong with the mandate ? Mr. Obama also thought it was a good idea .The same goes for health insurance exchanges , another idea formulated by conservatives and supported by Republican governors and legislators across the country for years . An exchange is as pro-market a mechanism as they come : free up buyers and sellers , standardize the products , add pricing transparency , and watch what happens . Market Economics 101 .In the shouting match over the health care law , most have somehow missed another of its obvious virtues : it enshrines accountability — yes , another conservative idea . Under today’s system , most health insurers ( and providers ) are accountable to the wrong people , often for the wrong reasons , with the needs of patients coming last . With the transparency , mobility and choice of the exchanges , businesses and individuals can decide for themselves which insurers ( and , embedded in their networks , which providers ) deserve their dollars . They can see , thanks to the often derided benefits standardization of the reform act , what they are actually buying . They can shop around . And businesses are free to decide that they are better off opting out , paying into funds that subsidize individuals’ coverage and letting their employees do their own shopping , with what is , in essence , their own compensation , relocated to the exchanges .Back when the idea of letting businesses and consumers pick their own plans — with their own money on an exchange — first floated around Washington , advocates called them “association health plans.” They , too , would have corrected for the lack of transparency , mobility and choice in local insurance markets by allowing the purchase of health insurance across state lines . They were the cornerstone of what would have been the Bush administration’s reform plan ( had the administration not been distracted by other matters ) . After the rejection of “Hillarycare” in the mid-’90s , association health plans emerged as the centerpiece of pro-market , Republican thinking about health reform — essentially what would become Romneycare , extended via federal law to cover the entire country . So much for Mr. Romney’s argument that his plan in Massachusetts was an expression of states’ rights . His own party had bigger plans for the rest of the country , and they looked a lot like Obamacare .

ANTON CHEKHOV once remarked that “one must not put a loaded rifle on the stage if no one is thinking of firing it.” In the term that ended last week , the Supreme Court reached a liberal outcome in cases involving President Obama’s health care law , Arizona’s draconian immigration statute and mandatory life sentences for juveniles . But the conservative majority also laid down a cache of weapons that future courts can use to attack many of the legislative achievements of the New Deal and the Great Society — including labor , environmental , civil rights and consumer protection laws — and to prevent new progressive legislation . Far from being a source of jubilation , the term may come back to haunt liberals .The immediate result of Thursday’s 5-to-4 health care ruling was a victory for the Obama administration and the millions of Americans who will get improved access to medical care . But four justices would have struck down every provision of the 900-plus-page act , and Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. , who provided the fifth vote to uphold the mandate that individuals buy insurance or pay a penalty , distanced himself from the law . “It is not our job , ” he wrote , “to protect the people from the consequences of their political choices.” The chief justice , who at 57 is likely to sit on the court for at least another two decades , made clear that government’s ability to address many of the nation’s most pressing problems is subject to some new limitations .We take for granted that the federal government can forbid landlords to reject a tenant based on his race or religion ; prohibit development on fragile wetlands ; finance the Medicare program for the elderly ; require public schools to give girls an equal opportunity to play sports ; collect revenue to pay for the National Institutes of Health and the national parks ; encourage energy conservation by taxing gas guzzlers ; prohibit discriminatory voter ID laws ; and vindicate the right of state government employees to take unpaid leave to care for sick relatives .The conservative legal movement has already attacked many of these provisions , and the Roberts court has been steadily supplying it with ammunition to do so . Conservative judicial rhetoric — for example , Justice Antonin Scalia’s denunciation last week of the Obama administration’s decision not to deport young , law-abiding illegal immigrants who came to this country as children — may be designed to change the political climate as well .The federal government’s ability to regulate economic and social life stems largely from four powers in the Constitution . Under the commerce clause , Congress can “regulate” national economic activity . Under the taxing power , it can “lay and collect Taxes.” Under the spending power , it can “provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States.” And under the enforcement powers , it can enact “appropriate legislation” to enforce the 14th Amendment’s equal protection and due process clauses and the 15th Amendment’s guarantee of the right to vote regardless of race .From the 1930s through the Warren and Burger courts , the Supreme Court largely deferred to the political branches’ judgments about the scope of these powers ; it was their partner , not their adversary . The court recognized — as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg pointed out in her opinion on the health care case — that the political process was the primary vehicle for limiting government’s powers .Under the last chief justice , William H. Rehnquist , the court began to turn , particularly on Congress’s commerce and enforcement powers . The court limited some statutes — notably , a section of the Americans With Disabilities Act that allowed state workers to sue their employers and a section of the Violence Against Women Act that gave victims of gender-motivated violence the right to sue in federal court — but upheld others , including other applications of the disabilities law , a provision of the Family and Medical Leave Act , and a statute criminalizing possession of homegrown marijuana .
In my post yesterday on potential metrics for assessing Obamacare’s claim to be a policy success , I didn’t directly address the law’s eventual impact on the deficit . So I’m grateful to Jonathan Chait for raising the issue , in the course of a post explaining why the Obamacare debate proves ( yet again , he would say ) that liberals are more empirical and data-driven than conservatives . Noting that many Republicans had alleged that the law’s promise of deficit reduction was based ( in Paul Ryan’s words ) on “gimmicks and smoke and mirrors , ” Chait cites a new C.B.O . estimate on the cost of the law’s coverage expansion and announces that reality has spoken , and the case is closed:There will never be a single dramatic moment that will shatter the right’s inbred health-care falsehoods the way the election , in a single night , discredited the poll-unskewers . But the Congressional Budget Office’s update on Obamacare issued last week is the latest and most powerful repudiation of the case Ryan and his allies made . It reiterates that , contrary to the right’s certainty that the apparent deficit-reducing measures would melt away as the program went online , it still reduces the deficit . Indeed , it turns out to be even more fiscally conservative than originally forecast . Every new forecast turns out to be more optimistic than the last .In fact , this is not exactly what the update says : It’s focused exclusively on the cost of the coverage expansion , which means that it doesn’t address the offsets ( sharp cuts to Medicare , in particular ) that Republicans had in mind when they accused the White House of relying on promises of future belt-tightening that will never actually be imposed . The update does reference a two-year-old projection which found that these offsets , if duly enacted , would reduce the deficit , but then it pleads agnosticism as to the current situation , writing that “CBO … can no longer determine exactly how the provisions of the ACA that are not related to the expansion of health insurance coverage have affected their projections of direct spending and revenues … isolating the incremental effects of those provisions on previously existing programs and revenues four years after enactment of the ACA is not possible.”So the report doesn’t tell us anything , and doesn’t claim to tell us anything , about whether all the promised Medicare cuts are actually happening ( spoiler : they aren’t ) , let alone whether they or any other revenue-raising provisions ( the Cadillac tax on high-value plans , the employer mandate ) are likely to be fully implemented in the future , or whether already-implemented and unpopular measures like the medical device tax could end up being repealed , or … well , you get the idea . Which means that by definition , the update isn’t proof that the law is “even more fiscally conservative than originally forecast , ” because that simply isn’t a question it sets out to answer .This doesn’t mean , though , that we can’t make an educated guess about the fiscal picture , and mine is that what’s happened to date is mostly a wash : The projected cost of coverage has gone down , as Chait says , mostly because health care inflation has been well below expectations and because Obamacare is covering fewer people than originally hoped , and the Obama White House has used those savings as a reason to postpone some unpleasant-to-implement provisions — delaying Medicare Advantage cuts , weakening IPAB’s mandate , delaying the employer mandate , etc .This interconnectedness of coverage , cost inflation and deficits is part why I didn’t include the deficit in my prior list of standards for success … because it’s entangled , in different ways , with the standards I did list . If enrollment ends up well below expectations , for instance , the fiscal cost of the program will be much more manageable — but it’s not clear , given the law’s coverage-expanding objectives , that this would actually count as true good news . Alternatively , if cost inflation stays low , then the fiscal issues will likewise diminish in a way that’s much more uncomplicatedly positive . But then in a scenario where inflation picks up again and enrollment heads back toward the levels that the law’s architects expected , the problem of actually cutting Medicare will loom larger , and the promised-but-postponed offsets will have to actually be pursued . At which point we’ll actually find out if the G.O.P . was right to dismiss them all as smoke and mirrors — but until then , the question is still open .The deeper debate here , though , is one that can’t necessarily be decisively adjudicated by even the most data-driven umpire , for reasons suggested by the C.B.O.’s point about the difficulty of “isolating” the effect of Obamacare on existing policies and programs . Here I mean that it’s entirely possible that the new health care law will end up being technically revenue neutral while also having a sweepingly negative impact on America’s fiscal picture overall — because its mix of cuts and tax hikes , if fully enacted , could drastically limit future policymakers’ options when the time comes to make further cuts or raise taxes to pay for Medicare and Social Security . ( This is part of what conservatives mean when they accuse the Obama White House of “double counting” and “gimmickry” and the like — they’re saying that if you make cuts to an insolvent-in-the-long-run program to pay for a new program , you’re engaged in something other than “fiscal conservatism , ” because you haven’t actually addressed your original insolvency problem . )Again , maybe — hopefully — a permanent slowdown in health care costs makes a lot of this problem go away . But it’s quite possible that we’ll end up , 10 or 15 years from now , with liberals declaring that Obamacare has been deficit-neutral and conservatives declaring that it’s created big fiscal problems , and with both sides having a reasonable ( and , yes , empirical ) point .
PROVIDENCE , R.I. â M is a 33-year old woman who swallowed silverware . She wasnât psychotic , or out of touch with reality . She knew it was not a good idea to swallow forks and knives and she wasnât trying to kill herself . In fact , each time she ingested utensils , she went to the emergency room so that doctors could remove them from her esophagus and stomach . Then the hospital transferred M to the psychiatric unit , where she was assigned to my care .When I met M she had already been hospitalized 72 times . Sheâd swallowed silverware â and batteries â before . Sometimes she inserted sharp objects or large doses of medication into her vagina . There are psychiatric patients who cut or burn themselves in an attempt to relieve mental anguish ; M did both of these things , too , periodically , but she had primarily developed a maladaptive habit of ingesting or inserting dangerous objects into her body as a means of coping with stress . Each time , she said , she felt better afterward . Then she brought herself to the emergency room for treatment .Mâs case is dramatic . But she is one of countless psychiatric patients who have nowhere to turn for care , other than the E.R . It is well known that millions of uninsured Americans , who canât afford regular medical care , use the countryâs emergency rooms for primary health care . The costs â to patientsâ health , to their wallets , and to the health care system â are well documented . Less visible is the grievous effect this shift is having on psychiatric care and on the mentally ill .Our failure to provide adequate psychiatric care to patients before they are in crisis affects us all . The lack of continuing outpatient care between hospitalizations leaves many psychiatric patients ill and often unmedicated . The consequences are felt in our communities , where the undertreated mentally ill are vulnerable to drug use , criminal recidivism ( with additional court and incarceration costs ) , victimization and suicide .The costs of Mâs repeated hospitalizations are staggering . Her ingestions and insertions incur the already high costs of hospital admission and the medical procedures and surgeries she requires . In addition , once M is hospitalized as a psychiatric patient , a staff member must stay with her at all times to make sure she doesnât ingest utensils from her meal trays , insert tools from group craft activities into her body or drink Purell from the dispensers on the unit walls .How could this cycle of self-injury be disrupted ? M and other psychiatric patients who turn to emergency rooms for care need regular outpatient appointments with a doctor they know and trust who can monitor their symptoms and assess the efficacy of their often complicated medication regimens . Sadly , Mâs history of recurrent hospital admissions is not uncommon . When people are admitted to the psychiatric hospital where I practice , their charts indicate how many times they have previously been hospitalized . Not infrequently , these numbers are more than twice the patientâs age . Recently I treated a 65-year-old man caught in a chronic cycle of homelessness and suicide attempts who had been in and out of the E.R . 246 times .If M had insurance , or enough money to pay out of pocket , she might see a therapist every week for an hour and a psychiatrist once or twice a month . Instead , sheâs treated by an overextended , publicly funded mental-health center where she sees a psychiatrist for 20 minutes , four times a year . Not surprisingly , her symptoms persist and she is hospitalized again and again .In one of the ironies in a country with health care discrepancies , a single hospital admission for M â paid for by the taxpayer-financed state medical-assistance program â costs more than a year of private outpatient care would .Our failure to provide a critical , basic level of outpatient psychiatric care to the mentally ill creates a volatile cycle in which uninsured or underinsured patients avail themselves of treatment only when they are in crisis . This is analogous to refusing to to treat hypertensive patients â or to monitor their blood pressure â unless they show up in the E.R . after having had a stroke .The number of psychiatric patients seeking care in emergency rooms is rising . New research by the California HealthCare Foundation reveals that about half of the stateâs adults and two-thirds of the adolescents with mental health needs arenât receiving treatment . According to the Utah State Division of Substance Abuse and Mental Health , 69 percent of Utahâs residents who need public mental health care do not receive any . In Rhode Island , where I practice , the National Alliance on Mental Illness reported a 65 percent increase in the number of mentally ill children living in public hospital emergency rooms following a series of state budget cuts . The increasing number of psychiatric patients relegated to emergency care creates a backlog in our E.R.âs , delaying or preventing medically ill patients from receiving necessary evaluation and treatment .With budget constraints and a shortage of psychiatric hospital beds , patients must be deemed a danger to themselves or others to qualify for inpatient admission . In order to guarantee that they will be evaluated in the emergency room and then admitted for further psychiatric treatment , patients must convincingly communicate their dangerousness or distress .In her last three E.R . visits , M has done just that . She registers at the intake desk , and then goes into the bathroom , where she swallows dangerous objects , or packets of pills . If M had a regular outpatient psychiatrist , she could call him or her in these moments of distress , schedule an urgent appointment , and obtain treatment and care from a simple phone call . But M does not have a relationship with a provider ; she has a relationship with an institution . And the institution requires that M be in imminent danger in order to be treated .We know that regular psychiatric care works . According to Dr. E. Fuller Torrey , president of the national nonprofit Treatment Advocacy Center , âAssisted outpatient treatment has proven to reduce psychiatric hospitalizations by more than 70 percent.âThe Affordable Care Act may improve access to psychiatric care for the mentally ill . The act will extend health care to 32 million Americans , and the National Association of Psychiatric Health Systems reports that this âspecifically includes mental health and substance abuse parity benefits.âBut , in order to fulfill that promise , we will need to place new societal value on the importance of mental health . Until accessible , affordable mental-health care is a universal right , too many psychiatric patients will continue to receive the reactionary , crisis-driven care that is all our emergency rooms are equipped to provide .
OF all the ways to limit health care costs , perhaps none is as popular as cutting payments to doctors . In recent years payment cuts have resulted in a sharp downturn in revenue for many hospitals and private practices . What this has meant for most physicians is that in order to maintain their income , they’ve had to see more patients . When you reduce the volume of air per breath , the only way to maintain ventilation is to breathe faster .As our workdays have gotten busier , we doctors have had less time to devote to individual patients . An internist I know in private practice used to see 15 patients a day . “Now reimbursement is so low I have to see at least 30 , ” he told me . “If I stay in the room more than 10 minutes , my assistant will call me and tell me to hurry up.”Racing through patient encounters , we practice with an ever-present fear that we will miss something , hurt someone and open ourselves up to legal ( not to mention moral ) liability . To cope with the anxiety , we start to call in experts for problems that perhaps we could handle ourselves if we had more time to think through a case . The specialists , in turn , order more tests , scans and the like .And therein lies the sad irony of the health cost containment paradigm in this country . There is no more wasteful entity in medicine than a rushed doctor .The Institute of Medicine , a federally funded research group in Washington , has estimated that wasteful health care spending — i.e. , spending that does not improve health outcomes — costs about $ 750 billion in the United States every year . Excessive paperwork and administrative costs explain some of this waste , but unnecessary or inefficiently delivered services , especially in hospitals , account for by far the largest chunk . Total payments to physicians , in comparison , are much smaller , making up a fifth or less of the money this country spends on health care .But even though physicians’ salaries account for a relatively small fraction of health care costs , physicians’ decisions may affect upward of 80 percent of total health spending . We order tests , prescribe drugs , hospitalize patients and — one of the costliest decisions a doctor can make today — call specialists for help .There are many downsides besides cost to having too many doctors on a case . Specialists’ recommendations are often contradictory . The kidney doctor advises careful hydration ; the cardiologist advises discontinuing intravenous fluid . Because specialists aren’t paid to confer with each other or to coordinate care — although the Affordable Care Act is putting payment systems into place that will do just this — they often leave primary physicians without clear direction on what to do .More important , patients don’t always require specialists . Patients , especially older adults , often have disease syndromes that can not be compartmentalized into individual problems and are probably best managed by a good general physician . When specialists are called in , each is apt to view a problem through the lens of his specific expertise . Patients generally end up worse off . I have seen it over and over .One of my patients went to the emergency room after swallowing a tiny fish bone . She told me about the experience when she came to see me . “They kept me down in that E.R . for two days ! ” she said . “They did X-rays , EKGs , CAT scans , God knows what . They had an ear , nose and throat specialist come by . They called a pulmonologist . They told me to follow up with my cardiologist . I told them it had nothing to do with it . It was the fish ! ”What is the solution to this predicament ? One option is to hire doctors as employees and put them on a salary , as they do at the Mayo and Cleveland Clinics , which takes away some of the financial impetus to cram more and more patients into a workday .Another option is to use bundled payments , which are calculated on the basis of the expected costs of a particular treatment ( for example , an entire hospitalization ) rather than discrete for every service . A major driver of health care overutilization is that doctors are paid piecemeal . There is little financial incentive to call in specialists if payments are bundled .Reforms will also have to focus more on education . Through an initiative of the American Board of Internal Medicine called Choosing Wisely , medical-specialty societies recently released lists of tests and procedures that are not beneficial to patients , including M.R.I.s for most lower back pain and stress tests when there are no signs of heart disease . These criteria are essential for educating physicians and patients alike about wasteful medical services that they should avoid . If patients were more involved in medical decision-making , there would be more constraints on doctors’ behavior , thus decreasing the possibility of these tests and consultations .Health care costs must be contained , but cutting payments to doctors is a self-defeating strategy . Policy makers need to focus on the drivers of waste . And one of the most potent is when doctors reflexively call other doctors for help .
NOT long ago , a 23-year-old woman joined my company as an assistant in the advertising sales department at a starting salary of $ 35,000 . Smart , ambitious and poised , she should have a promising future . Unfortunately , her earnings prospects are threatened . Like many Americans , sheâs unaware of how much of her compensation is being eaten up by health care costs , and how much this share will grow as long as the increase in health costs exceeds growth in gross domestic product . Thatâs just math .The Affordable Care Act does require employers , beginning this year , to note on W-2âs how much both the employee and the employer contributed to health care costs . Maybe that will help diminish the ignorance regarding true health care costs . But even with greater awareness , many Americans still might not understand that the largest effect of the cost of our health care system is to reduce the amount of money they actually take home .I have estimated that our 23-year-old employee will bear at least $ 1.8 million in health care costs over her lifetime . Thatâs assuming that such costs donât grow by more than current government estimates , that she never has a working spouse , and that she and her dependents donât ever contract a serious illness .Even after decades of financial engineering , including both the already-implemented and the planned aspects of the Affordable Care Act , the American health care system can be called successful mainly in its ability to hide its enormous cost .My new employee thinks that she is paying roughly $ 2,600 for health care in her first year on the job â her $ 500 deductible plus her $ 2,100 share of the companyâs health insurance premiums . In fact , sheâs paying more than $ 10,000 into the countryâs health care system . As her employer , our company will pay $ 6,190 of her health care costs , money that might otherwise go to her in salary . ( From my point of view as a chief executive of a company , health care is just a different form of compensation . ) She is also paying more than $ 1,500 in federal and state taxes to finance Medicare and Medicaid .Clearly , personal health insurance is not the only way our employees pay into our health care system . There is the 1.45 percent of every paycheck that goes to Medicare , as well as the portion matched by the employer . Furthermore , a large slice of her general taxes are , in fact , health care costs : roughly 20 percent of federal spending and 10 percent of state spending support Medicare and Medicaid . She must pay for all of this .And of course , when my 23-year-old employee turns 65 , sheâll be eligible for Medicare and will begin to pay Medicare premiums of , say , $ 140 a month in todayâs dollars . She is likely to do so for the rest of her life .For employees like her , however , the greatest impact of exploding health care costs will arrive in the form of stagnating wages . Before the Affordable Care Act became law , President Obamaâs Council of Economic Advisers warned that its projections to 2040 showed that âessentially all of the rise in average compensation due to increasing productivity over time would go to health insurance , and essentially none would go to take-home wages.âThis year , a standard deductible family policy for our company will carry premiums of roughly $ 23,000 . How has health care gotten so expensive that even a middle-income worker faces such a burden ?In the world of health care analysis , there are basically two schools of thought . The first is that health care is so fundamentally different from other goods and services that a normal market canât drive down its prices . This school of thought makes a number of assumptions : health care consumers are desperate and have no leverage to avoid high pricing . An individualâs need for care depends on luck and genes , so that social fairness requires pooling risk .An aging population needs ever more care . New technologies offer beneficial advances but only at great expense . For-profit motivations conflict with fundamental human needs , requiring extensive regulatory oversight . Managing the insurance system requires costly and complex administration ( with direct annual administrative costs now running at roughly $ 1,900 per household ) .
WASHINGTON â THE great irony of Barack Obamaâs political rise is that it depended on what turned out to be his single biggest political miscalculation . From the moment he appeared on a national stage â in his 2004 âthere is not a liberal America and a conservative Americaâ speech â he held himself out as the leader who could transcend the partisan divide and win over Republicans .His policy plans did not set him apart from the other Democrats running . Even on the Iraq war , which he had opposed from the start , he and other Democrats mostly agreed by 2007 . Mr. Obama won the nomination largely because of what he called hope and change and Hillary Clinton mocked as a vision of the skies opening up to reveal celestial choirs singing .All of that seems very long ago , doesnât it ?Mr. Obama trounced the Republicans last week with a Hillaryesque strategy of holding firm and winning an argument , not by finding common ground . He , his advisers and Congressional Democrats decided from the start that trading changes to the health care law for the reopening of the government and the lifting of the debt ceiling would merely encourage Republicans to create future showdowns .When the face-off ended and the government reopened Thursday , Mr. Obama kept up the pressure . âYou donât like a particular policy or a particular president ? â he asked . âThen argue for your position . Go out there and win an election.âIn those words was a hint of a new strategy that suddenly seems less far-fetched â more available to the White House â than it did when large parts of the government closed on Oct. 1 .Yes , Mr. Obamaâs immediate task will involve returning to the negotiating table , to talk about a budget deal . But he has spent much of the past five years overestimating his ability to find common ground on such issues . The White House has come to believe that many Republicans are interested only in victory , not in compromise-laden deals that , say , trade Medicare cuts for new taxes on the affluent or trade a more secure border for a path to citizenship .And Mr. Obama now seems more willing to play the victory game . He can make the case ( supported by polling ) that his positions on several major issues â including immigration and taxes â enjoy more public support than Republican positions . If there are still no deals to be had , Mr. Obama and his fellow Democrats can concentrate , albeit quietly , on highlighting their differences with Republicans and taking their case to the voters in next yearâs midterm election .Thanks to the vagaries of Congressional districts , Democrats would have to win the aggregate popular vote in House races by about 6.8 percentage points or more to win back a majority , estimates Dave Wasserman of the Cook Political Report . Such a large margin would be unprecedented in modern politics for the party that controls the White House , and Mr. Obamaâs mediocre approval ratings wonât make it easier .Yet the Republican Partyâs current standing also has few precedents . Recent polls have put its approval rating between 20 and 25 percent , at or near recorded lows . After the shutdown , the Cook Political Report changed its rating on 15 House races â 14 in the Democratsâ direction â and said Republicans were âapproaching the danger zone.âRecapturing the House may be the one event that could fundamentally alter the presidentâs second term , a term that so far has accomplished little beyond protecting his first termâs projects . Mr. Obama would then have to negotiate largely with Republicans in the Senate , where some deals seem available . The Senate has already passed a bipartisan immigration overhaul .There are clearly risks to a difference-highlighting strategy for Mr. Obama . He won a second term , and the shutdown debate , partly because voters judged him as willing to compromise . Some liberals may imagine that if only Democratic politicians were more passionate and pure , the rest of the country would come along . But the country is not as liberal as liberals wish it were .A second irony of Mr. Obamaâs career is that he has proved better at the messy business of helping hold together his own partyâs Congressional caucus than President Bill Clinton did , despite their popular images . For all the talk of Mr. Obamaâs distaste for schmoozing , he was the one who finally passed a sweeping health care law . To do so , he and Congressional leaders had to hold together every single Senate Democrat , from Bernie Sanders on the left to Ben Nelson on the right .The Democratic solidarity continued through the shutdown , with almost no meaningful defections . But because the Democrats no longer control the House â and todayâs House Republicans are so passionately conservative â the solidarity is not enough to pass bills .Publicly , the White House is likely to emphasize negotiation for now . âThis was not a trivial event here , â David Axelrod , the Obama confidant , told me , referring to the shutdown . The outcome âis a powerful tool here in promoting the potential for a compromise.â Mr. Obamaâs âview of this has been hardened by five years of experience , but I donât think he will close his mind to the possibility of a compromise , â he added .Perhaps the most intriguing question facing the Democrats is whether they will abandon their insistence on higher taxes for the affluent in exchange for cuts to Medicare and Social Security . With the deficit falling , Democrats could change their focus from tax increases to spending increases on their biggest priorities . They could push for Mr. Obamaâs âPreschool for Allâ proposal , along with a partial reversal of the recent sequestration cuts and more money for climate research , college financial aid and highways .If the deal did not seem good enough â or if Mr. Obama decided that tax increases had to be part of any budget deal â Democrats could then turn their attention to the public debate and the midterms .Throughout his career , Mr. Obama has shown an openness to conservative ideas ( like cutting Social Security and overhauling public schools ) that sometimes vexes his allies . But he has also come to believe that much of the modern Republican Party is broken , reliant on an aging minority of voters and hobbled by leaders who can not reliably deliver their rank and file even when the leaders want to deal .The man who once dismissed talk of red and blue America now sees the divide as a central aspect of American life . He has begun to act accordingly . For the moment , the strategy is working .
WASHINGTON â THE United States government is likely to shut down nonessential services tomorrow , after House Republicans voted before dawn yesterday to attach a one-year delay of President Obamaâs health care law ( and a repeal of a tax to pay for it ) to legislation to keep the government running . The Democratic-led Senate is expected to refuse .House Republicans also said last week that they would not agree to lift the debt ceiling unless implementation of the health law was delayed by one year . So the government is also headed toward a mid-October default on its debts â and a full-blown constitutional crisis .Failure to raise the debt will force the president to break a law â the only question is which one .The Constitution requires the president to spend what Congress has instructed him to spend , to raise only those taxes Congress has authorized him to impose and to borrow no more than Congress authorizes .If President Obama spends what the law orders him to spend and collects the taxes Congress has authorized him to collect , then he must borrow more than Congress has authorized him to borrow . If the debt ceiling is not raised , he will have to violate one of these constitutional imperatives . Which should he choose ?In 2011 , when Congress last flirted with not raising the debt ceiling , lawyers disagreed . Some argued that the president must honor the debt ceiling , thereby violating budget laws . Others held that he must honor budget legislation . No one argued that he should unilaterally raise taxes . Professors Neil H. Buchanan and Michael C. Dorf , who parsed the arguments in the Columbia Law Review in 2012 , concluded that all options were bad , but that disregarding the debt ceiling was least bad from a legal standpoint .I agree . Lawyers tend to play down policy considerations as a basis for interpreting law . In this case , the consequences are so overwhelmingly on one side that they can not be ignored by the president and should not be ignored by the courts . If the debt ceiling is not increased , the president should disregard it , and honor spending and tax legislation .A decision to cut spending enough to avoid borrowing would instantaneously slash outlays by approximately $ 600 billion a year . Cutting payments to veterans , Social Security benefits and interest on the national debt by half would just about do the job . But such cuts would not only illegally betray promises to veterans , the elderly and disabled and bondholders ; they would destroy the credit standing of the United States and boost borrowing costs on the nationâs $ 12 trillion publicly held debt .There is no clear legal basis for deciding what programs to cut . Defense contractors , or Medicare payments to doctors ? Education grants , or the F.B.I. ? Endless litigation would follow . No matter how the cuts might be distributed , they would , if sustained for more than a very brief period , kill the economic recovery and cause unemployment to return quickly to double digits .Nor is it reasonable to expect the president to collect more in taxes than is authorized by law . For him to do so would infringe on Congressâs most fundamental powers and the principles on which the nation was founded .The only defensible option for the president if the debt ceiling is not raised is to disregard the debt ceiling . The action would be unconstitutional because it would be illegal . Financial markets might react negatively , but not nearly so negatively as if the United States failed to redeem bonds or to pay interest on its debt .The president would be attacked . He might even be impeached by the House . But maybe not : the House would then be saying that the president should have illegally failed to pay F.B.I . agents , or school districts , or Medicare doctors . In any case , he would not be convicted by the Senate . And he would have saved the nation from much agony .Disregarding the debt ceiling would have one additional , thoroughly benign effect . It would end the capacity of Congressional minorities to precipitate crises in order to accomplish goals for which they lacked the votes . Today , a minority is holding hostage all federal programs in an attempt to eviscerate a law that Congress passed , the president signed and the Supreme Court upheld â the Affordable Care Act . In the future , an imaginative and irresponsible minority could use the threat not to raise the debt ceiling for any purpose â to shape tax policy , or foreign policy , or civil rights policy .The debt ceiling is the fiscal equivalent of the human appendix â a law with no discoverable purpose . It is one law too many . Once Congress has set tax rates and spending levels , it has effectively said what it wants the debt to be . If Congress leaves the debt ceiling at a level inconsistent with duly enacted spending and tax laws , the president has no choice but to ignore it .
The true ideological inclinations of the Obama White House can be endlessly debated , but slightly more than halfway through this presidency I think it’s fair to make the following generalization : Obama has governed as a business-friendly social democrat and an aggressive social liberal , as a hawkish interventionist when intervention seems cheap and easy ( drones , missiles , etc . ) and a cautious realist when it doesn’t , and as a surprisingly vigorous defender of presidential prerogatives across a variety of fronts . A few weeks ago , I characterized Obama-era liberalism as featuring “an imperial presidency , a corporatist economic policy , and then a libertarian turn on almost every social issue , ” and while that line misses various nuances and complexities , as one-sentence summaries go I think it’s pretty good .It’s also useful for understanding why the last few weeks have been so rough for this White House . Obviously they’ve been difficult because scandal has piled on scandal : The resurfacing Benghazi affair , the news that the Internal Revenue Service took a disproportionate election-year interest in conservative activists , and now the revelation that the Department of Justice secretly seized two months worth of phone records for Associated Press reporters as part of a highly aggressive leak investigation . But it’s also because the details of the scandals raise uncomfortable questions about the particular policy synthesis that Obama has pursued — and they’re getting traction at a time when other high-profile stories , from the debate over the Oregon Medicaid study in wonkland to the trial of the late-term abortionist Kermit Gosnell over in culture-war territory , are raising similarly uncomfortably questions on other fronts .In the case of Benghazi , as Tim Carney points out , you have a story that’s ultimately about an administration trying to downplay the resilience of Al Qaeda and the messiness of post-intervention Libya , lest those realities sow election-year doubts about the success of the White House’s entire light-footprint , drones-and-bombs approach to counterterrorism and the Middle East . In the case of the I.R.S . and Justice Department imbroglios , you have two stories that don’t need to have direct links to the Oval Office to remind people of the kind of abuses that that imperial presidencies tend to generate . ( It’s also striking that both the new Benghazi revelations and the I.R.S./DoJ scandals came hard hard on the heels of Rand Paul’s filibuster , which was arguably the first moment when the Obama administration faced a significant political challenge on questions of executive overreach . )Meanwhile , whatever spin you put on the Oregon Medicaid study , it was a real-world test of the administration’s signature domestic policy initiative whose results clearly didn’t live up to liberal expectations , and it’s given skeptics of Obamacare perhaps their most statistically potent ammunition at a moment when the new health care law is about to face the test of implementation . ( Which , of course , involves new responsibilities for … the I.R.S . ) Likewise , while the implications of the Gosnell case are open for debate , it’s the first occasion in a while when social liberals have clearly been forced on the defensive — and the first high-profile story in Obama’s entire presidency to throw his own radicalism on abortion into sharp relief .Obviously his White House faced major challenges all across its contentious first term . But it was rare for the administration to see its attempt at a new left-of-center synthesis challenged and undercut across multiple fronts at once — on foreign policy and civil liberties and domestic policy and social issues . Journalists no doubt talk too much about narratives and storylines , but they do matter , and having all of these stories in the wind at once is significant , in part , because it threatens to rewrite the public’s understanding of what Obama-ism represents . The president wants to be seen , and works to be seen , as a pragmatic , data-driven steward of popular programs who’s leading a wave of social progress at home while keeping us as safe from terrorists as any Republican tough guy could . But the current mix of headlines suggests a very different take on the same record — in which Obama embodies a “new” progressivism that’s too comfortable with executive power and too eager to conduct foreign policy from 30,000 feet , too cozy with powerful interest groups and too wedded to a dysfunctional welfare state , and as far outside the mainstream on social issues as any of the right-wingers it likes to define itself against .Whether this alternative narrative actually takes hold with the public and press remains to be seen . But the last few weeks have clearly made it more credible , and an easier sell to the unconvinced , than all the slings and arrows of 2012 campaign .
WashingtonTHE obvious victor in the Supreme Courtâs health care decision was President Obama , who risked vast amounts of political capital to pass the Affordable Care Act . A somewhat more subtle victor , but equally important , was the rule of law more generally : in an era when so many people on the left and right view the justices , and constitutional questions , through the prism of politics , the court today made clear that law matters and that it isnât just politics by other means .But there was a subtle loser too , and that is the federal government . By opening new avenues for the courts to rewrite the law , the federal government may have won the battle but lost the war .Indeed , it is becoming so commonplace for the federal courts to invalidate legislation that a decision like the health care one is celebrated resoundingly â even when the court has invalidated part of a law Congress passed . In just one day , the Supreme Court struck down as unconstitutional just as many laws of Congress as it did during the first 70 years of its existence : two .Obviously , health care has captured the minds of Americans â but moments before the court announced that decision , which upheld the overall law but invalidated a requirement that states expand Medicaid coverage in exchange for federal financing , it struck down another law , the Stolen Valor Act , which made it a federal misdemeanor to lie about having received a military decoration .The health care decision also contains the seeds for a potential restructuring of federal-state relations . For example , until now , it had been understood that when the federal government gave money to a state in exchange for the stateâs doing something , the federal government was free to do so as long as a reasonable relationship existed between the federal funds and the act the federal government wanted the state to perform .In potentially ominous language , the decision says , for the first time , that such a threat is coercive and that the states can not be penalized for not expanding their Medicaid coverage after receiving funds . And it does so in the context of Medicaid , which Congress created and can alter , amend or abolish at any time . The states knew the terms of the deal when they joined â and those terms continue to be enshrined in the federal code .This was the first significant loss for the federal governmentâs spending power in decades . The fancy footwork that the court employed to view the act as coercive could come back in later cases to haunt the federal government . Many programs are built on the governmentâs spending power , and the existence of an extraconstitutional limit on that power is a worrisome development .The government told the court that longstanding laws , like the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 , contain clauses that condition money on state performance of certain activities . The decision leaves open the question of whether those acts , and many others ( like the Clean Air Act ) , are now unconstitutional as well .Even more worrisome for the federal government is the way the court reached the result it did on Medicaid . The court had to rewrite the statute to save it from a constitutional problem by eliminating the part of the law that permitted the federal government to withdraw Medicaid financing . The result , as Justice Anthony M. Kennedy warned , was effectively to leave in place a statute that Congress never enacted . ( That is the same move that Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. employed in 2009 when he led the court to uphold the constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act . )But there is a danger here too : that courts are given the power to rewrite legislation altogether , and leave legislation in place ( like health care ) in a form that Congress might never have approved and that would be difficult to ever repeal .Of equal concern is the courtâs analysis of the constitutionality of the individual mandate . While the court upheld the mandate , it did so by rejecting the federal governmentâs claim that it was regulating commerce . There is no judicial precedent or language in the Constitution that compelled that result ; instead , the majority reasoned by constitutional inference .The court employed language that could be read to suggest that whenever statutes are novel , they are unconstitutional . This atextual reading of the Constitution , odd for âstrict constructionists , â may later blossom into a radical constitutional theory that could upend decades , if not centuries , of precedent , going all the way back to Chief Justice John Marshallâs famous opinion in the 1819 case McCulloch v. Maryland , which spoke of a flexible , adaptable Constitution .Time will tell whether todayâs decision foreshadows things to come . But one thing is apparent : Americans are growing increasingly comfortable , if not always happy , with the idea of nine men and women in Washington handing down rulings that remove decisions from the legislative process or even rewrite legislation altogether .While Chief Justice Roberts wrote an opinion that was apolitical and deserves much praise for its statesmanship , he did so within a legal context that is becoming less and less democratic . That context is obviously not of his making , but it makes imperative a serious conversation about judicial restraint .
THE stunner yesterday was that Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. , joined by the Supreme Court’s four most liberal justices , wrote the majority opinion that upheld the individual mandate in President Obama’s signature Affordable Care Act , which requires Americans to obtain health insurance or pay a penalty . In an ironic twist , the chief justice simultaneously accepted the conservative argument that Congress’s power to regulate interstate commerce did not include the power to regulate economic inactivity , like a decision not to purchase health care . The court ruled 5 to 4 on that point , with the chief justice joined by the court’s four other conservative justices .But what Chief Justice Roberts took from Congress with one hand , he gave it with the other : a broad reading of the taxing power . In the majority opinion , he wrote that since paying a penalty for not obtaining insurance could be seen as a tax , and since “the Constitution permits such a tax , it is not our role to forbid it , or to pass upon its wisdom or fairness.” He will no doubt attract praise in some quarters for splitting this baby .But his decision is wrong . As a matter of constitutional text , legal history and logic , the power to regulate commerce and the power to tax should not be separated . It is not good for the court or the country that the chief justice’s position in such an important case is confused at its core .Consider first the constitutional text . Chief Justice Roberts refers to Congress’s power to “lay and collect Taxes.” But it’s worth recalling the surrounding language , which notes that Congress has the power to “lay and collect Taxes” only in order “to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States.”Historically speaking , this clause corrected one of the great weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation ( the precursor to the Constitution ) , which had forced Congress to essentially beg the states for the revenues needed to run its business . By giving Congress independent powers over taxation and other revenue sources , the Constitution ended that dependency . But as a quid pro quo , the Constitution also restricted the use of these revenues to classical public goods — benefits that must be given to all citizens , if given to any — like paying off national debts and paying for the nation’s defense . General welfare , mentioned in parallel with these two phrases , is best read as covering only matters that advance the welfare of the United States as a whole . The redistribution of income , or “transfer payments” among citizens , like those mandated under the Affordable Care Act , doesn’t qualify for taxation in this originalist reading of the Constitution .Through the early 20th century , the Supreme Court was cognizant of this tight relationship between the power to regulate an activity directly and to the power to tax it . The basic idea relies on a simple economic insight : taxation and regulation are close substitutes , so a limitation on one power matters little if the other power is still available . There is no practical difference between ordering an action , and taxing or fining people who don’t do that same thing . If the Constitution limits direct federal powers , it must also limit Congress’s indirect power of taxation .In his opinion , Chief Justice Roberts didn’t come to grips with the two critical early Supreme Court cases that set out the relationship between the powers of regulation and taxation — a relationship that survived the New Deal revolution in understanding the Commerce Clause . In the Child Labor Tax case of 1922 , the Supreme Court refused to uphold a tax equal to 10 percent of the net profits of any firm that shipped goods into interstate commerce if the firm used child labor anywhere in its plants . Chief Justice William Howard Taft noted that the court’s earlier decision in Hammer v. Dagenhart ( 1918 ) forbade Congress to use its commerce power to prohibit outright the shipment of ordinary goods across state lines because they were made in factories that used child labor . A heavy tax , the court argued , could not be used to mount an end run around this constitutional obstacle to its own power .The same point was reinforced in 1936 in United States v. Butler , which struck down a tax on agricultural commodities because it sought to achieve the then unconstitutional regulatory aim of reducing the total acreage in agricultural production . After the 1942 case Wickard v. Filburn , when the Commerce Clause was held to permit such regulation , the tax became just as permissible as direct regulation . Wickard expanded the scope of federal power , but it did nothing to upset the constitutional parity between the taxing and commerce powers .Chief Justice Roberts has ignored this fundamental principle : If direct regulation is beyond the scope of the Commerce Clause ( as he held ) , then taxation as an indirect route to the same regulation should be off limits as well ( as he failed to hold ) . This is a baby that should not be split . His attempt to do so undermines his ruling , the court and the Constitution .
PRESIDENT OBAMA has endured much criticism of his legislative skills from his fellow progressives . His conciliatory approach has been compared unfavorably with Franklin D. Roosevelt’s gleeful pugnacity and Lyndon B. Johnson’s relentless arm-twisting . His willingness to strike deals with corporations has been tagged “business as usual.” Many progressives , frustrated over the past three years , have concluded that the political system is fundamentally broken because corporate power has been allowed to suffocate popular liberal policies .But the Supreme Court’s upholding of Mr. Obama’s health care law reminds us that the president’s approach has achieved significant results . If his liberal critics paused to assess how he achieved such results , they would not see a system paralyzed by corporations ; they would see that the most liberal reforms in more than 40 years have been brought about because Mr. Obama views corporate power as a force to bargain with , not an enemy to vanquish .The necessity of corporate support for , or at least acquiescence to , liberal policies is not a new development in the history of American liberalism . Indeed it has been one of its hallmarks .Roosevelt may be remembered for his combativeness toward corporations ; he famously said , “I welcome their hatred.” But he said that in 1936 , only after key New Deal legislation had passed with the help of the United States Chamber of Commerce and the American Bankers Association .Early on , Roosevelt was quite adept at bargaining with corporations . In his first 100 days , to attract corporate support for the National Industrial Recovery Act , he won collective bargaining , minimum wages and maximum hours in exchange for a temporary suspension of antitrust law , so businesses could fix prices . To establish the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1934 , he made concessions to Wall Street that scrapped statutory requirements in favor of regulatory flexibility . The following year , to allow the Federal Reserve to better conduct monetary policy , he gave bankers representation on the policy committee .Johnson also found little value in warring with corporations . He won a Keynesian tax cut in early 1964 , defeating budget-conscious conservatives , thanks to a broad coalition that included corporations . He attracted business support to back his first antipoverty bill by junking plans to promote family farming and push businesses to hire long-term unemployed people . He created the Transportation Department , in 1966 , only after exempting resistant shipping interests from its jurisdiction . He incited a new era of environmental protection , increasing federal responsibility for cleaning air and water , while defusing corporate opposition by trading away federal pollution standards .Democratic presidents typically pay dearly when they choose to fight corporations instead of deal with them . Jimmy Carter sapped his political capital in the first two years of his presidency by trying to pass , with belligerent anticorporate rhetoric , a National Energy Act that would reduce our dependence on oil . He gave two major national addresses intended to rally the public and fend off critics’ attacks . At a town hall , he lashed out at oil companies for enjoying “a position of privilege in our country for too long” and having undue influence in Congress . But these confrontational tactics failed to rouse enough public ire to trump that influence , and Mr. Carter settled for a far smaller energy bill than he originally demanded .Or consider President Bill Clinton . In 1993 , his health care task force largely resisted meeting with insurance lobbyists as it drafted legislation . In turn , the insurers didn’t wait for the legislation to be finalized before embarking on a vicious advertising campaign . When the first lady , Hillary Rodham Clinton , tried to belittle that effort , fund-raising for the insurance lobby skyrocketed and its advertising budget quintupled . Mr. Clinton , his bully pulpit diminished , couldn’t get Congress to vote on his bill . He suffered such a humiliating defeat that his ability to enact any other progressive reform was severely crippled .
IF the government shutdown has shown us anything , itâs that the 80 or so House Republicans driving the crisis have emerged as the most unified force in politics : tightly organized , highly disciplined and ideologically firm .But wasnât their plan to make the budget a vehicle for defunding President Obamaâs health care legislation doomed from the start ? And even if this small band has the backing of voters in their safely drawn âredâ districts , as well as Tea Party support , havenât their unyielding tactics antagonized a majority of the public ?In fact , this minority faction â the âsuicide caucus , â as the conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer has called it â may be less shortsighted and self-defeating than it appears . At a time when so many officials in both parties still invoke the virtues of compromise and perpetuate the ideal of common ground on which âconservative pragmatistsâ can meet âmoderate Democrats , â these more combative Republicans may be in the vanguard of a new post-consensus politics .Consider the warnings of many , including some in the conservative establishment , that the shutdown will rebound against the party . As evidence they cite theÂ shutdown of 1995 . The winner then was President Bill Clinton , who deftly used the episode to right his wobbly presidency and then coasted to a second term in 1996 .But Ted Cruz , the Texas senator who helped set the stage for the conflict , has offered a different interpretation . Those prophesying ruin âneed to go back and read their history books a little more closelyâ regarding 1995 , he said on Laura Ingrahamâs radio show in July . âIn the next election , 1996 , Republicans held on to the majority in the House , the first time Republicans had done that since 1930 , in 66 years , â Mr. Cruz pointed out . âWe lost a total of nine seats in the House . In the Senate , we gained two seats.âMr. Cruz , in other words , was calculating the odds of success in terms of the Congressional , rather than presidential , outcome . This makes sense , since he was born in 1970 and came of age in the years when his party struggled to build national majorities ( winning the popular vote only once in the six presidential elections held from 1992 to 2012 ) and instead flexed its muscles through the legislature .Changing demographics would seem to weaken the appeal of anti-government figures like Mr. Cruz ( who was born in Canada and is of Cuban ancestry ) . That is why traditional conservatives like the columnist Michael Gerson insist that âpragmatic Republicansâ are the partyâs salvation , and that Mr. Cruz and his allies are mounting a ârevolt against reality.âBut as America becomes more diverse , another population has come more clearly into view : the alienated and disenchanted . These people have embraced a libertarian and anti-government outlook and have little use for what they see as the compromised , impure âbig governmentâ conservatism of the Reagan and Bush years .To this constituency , the Republican who will go as far as he can â taking one last crack at undoing Mr. Obamaâs health care reform or voting later this month not to raise the debt ceiling â is not an obstructionist but a politician of principle , a rebel with a cause .âThe business of the opposition is to oppose , â as Robert A. Taft , the Republican senator who led the attempt to slow down New Deal programs , once said .Recent victories that Republicans have won , for instance on gun control , have come not through compromise but by out-organizing and outspending their opponents . The hallowed idea of consensus , and the dream of building a majority , has given way to a survival strategy .The most striking example of Republican opposition is the revival of the doctrine of statesâ rights , historically associated with slavery and Jim Crow . There are unmistakable overtones of this past in the anti-Obamacare movement in some of the 26 states , especially in the Deep South , that have rejected the Medicaid expansion .
MITT ROMNEY , moderate . That earnestly sought post-debate public image contrasts starkly with Mr. Romney’s actual positions on many issues , especially the future trajectory of government spending .Clinging tightly to a studied vagueness when pressed for unpopular specifics , Mr. Romney has put forward a budget framework that would not eviscerate Medicare and Social Security , as is commonly believed , but would slash everything else that’s not defense .President Obama should use Tuesday night’s debate to press Mr. Romney to defend — or even just explain — these proposed cuts , which would be far more draconian than those advanced by his running mate , Paul D. Ryan . Mr. Ryan is widely viewed as the real fiscal hawk , but in key areas , his views on spending levels are actually closer to Mr. Obama’s than to Mr. Romney’s .All in all , Mr. Ryan and Mr. Romney do see the future similarly — over the next decade , they want government spending reduced to about 20 percent of the United States’ gross domestic product , below the historic average of around 21 percent . ( Recognizing that an aging society costs more , Mr. Obama proposes to hold spending at its current level , 23 percent . )These differences may not sound like much , but by 2023 , each percentage point of G.D.P . could represent about $ 250 billion in federal spending .Though Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. brought it up repeatedly in his debate with Mr. Ryan on Thursday , Social Security — the single biggest government expenditure — is not on the battlefield . Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan have each backed away from threats to privatize or cut it and now propose to spend the same amount on it as Mr. Obama would in the coming decade .That’s not the case with Medicare . Mr. Obama and Mr. Ryan have each endorsed similar packages of about $ 950 billion of savings over 10 years , while Mr. Romney has opposed any reduction , making it virtually impossible for him to achieve his overall spending limit .To be sure , Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan agree — and differ with Mr. Obama — on many matters , like how to contain the growth in Medicare spending and whether to raise the eligibility age .And they part company from Mr. Obama when it comes to the Affordable Care Act ( the Republicans demand its repeal , claiming it would save about $ 1.6 trillion ) and Medicaid ( Messrs. Romney and Ryan want it turned over to the states and want to cut nearly 20 percent from Mr. Obama’s planned levels ) .But with respect to nearly half the budget , Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan widely diverge from each other .Mr. Romney is calling for a huge increase in defense spending — roughly $ 2 trillion more over the next decade than Mr. Ryan wants to spend , which is only $ 400 billion above Mr. Obama’s budget — even though the military is not asking for such an increase . Such an increase would force giant reductions , about 40 percent , in everything that’s left .“Everything else” isn’t some catchall of small items , like feeding Big Bird . We’re talking about a vast array of programs including civilian and military pensions , food stamps , unemployment and disability compensation , the earned income and child tax credits , family support and nutrition , K-12 education , transportation , public safety and disaster relief . And on and on .All told , Mr. Romney would allocate $ 6.9 trillion for these items , compared with the $ 9.3 trillion proposed by his own running mate ( and Mr. Obama’s $ 12 trillion , which itself represents a 9 percent reduction from current levels , after adjusting for inflation ) .No doubt some of what is buried within “other mandatory and nondefense discretionary spending” can be eliminated . Perhaps Americans won’t miss a few national parks or the space program .But also nestled within this category are critical outlays for investments in infrastructure and research .Eating the seed corn is never advisable , yet that’s what Washington is already doing . The share of spending on infrastructure ( roads , airports , dams and the like ) fell from 2 percent of G.D.P . in 1971 to 1 percent in 2010 .More — not less — government money needs to be invested in these kinds of growth-generating projects ( not to mention education and training ) .I recognize that in the real world , cuts on the scale envisioned by Mr. Romney will prove politically untenable , which would force a President Romney to rethink his agenda .But as a statement of intent , it’s Mr. Romney — not Mr. Ryan — who has produced the budget that would more dramatically reduce the services offered by government , and in ways that would shock and outrage most Americans . We can only hope that Mr. Obama will draw those contrasts clearly in the debate .
PRINCETON , N.J. â THE Republicans in the House of Representatives who declare that they may refuse to raise the debt limit threaten to do more than plunge the government into default . They are proposing a blatant violation of the 14th Amendment , which states that âthe validity of the public debt of the United States , authorized by lawâ is sacrosanct and âshall not be questioned.âYet the Obama administration has repeatedly suppressed any talk of invoking the Constitution in this emergency . Last Thursday Jay Carney , the White House press secretary , said , âWe do not believe that the 14th Amendment provides that authority to the presidentâ to end the crisis . Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew reiterated the point on Sunday and added that the president would have âno optionâ to prevent a default on his own .In defense of the administrationâs position , the legal scholar Laurence H. Tribe , who taught President Obama at Harvard Law School , has insisted , as he put it two years ago , that âonly political courage and compromiseâ can avert disaster .These assertions , however , have no basis in the history of the 14th Amendment ; indeed , they distort that history , and in doing so shackle the president . In fact , that record clearly shows that Congress intended the amendment to prevent precisely the abuses that the current House Republicans blithely condone .Congress passed the 14th Amendment and sent it to the states for ratification in June 1866 . Its section on the public debt began as an effort to ensure that the government would not be liable for debts accrued by the defeated Confederacy , but also to ensure that its own debt would be honored .That was important because conservative Northern Democrats , many of whom had sympathized with the Confederacy , were in a position to obstruct or deny repayment on the full value of the public debt by paying creditors in depreciated paper money , or âgreenbacks.â This effective repudiation of obligations already accrued â to , among others , hundreds of thousands of Union pensioners and widows , as well as investors â would destroy confidence in the government and endanger the economy .As the wording of the amendment evolved during the Congressional debate , the principle of the debtâs inviolability became a general proposition , applicable not just to the Civil War debt but to all future accrued debts of the United States . The Republican Senate leader , Benjamin F. Wade of Ohio , declared that by placing the debt âunder the guardianship of the Constitution , â investors would be spared from being âsubject to the varying majorities which may arise in Congress.âTwo years later , on the verge of the amendmentâs ratification , its champions inside the Republican Party made their intentions absolutely clear , proclaiming in their 1868 party platform that ânational honor requires the payment of the public indebtedness in the utmost good faith to all creditors at home and abroad , â and pronouncing any repudiation of the debt âa national crime.âMore than three generations later , in 1935 , Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes , ruling in the case of Perry v. the United States , revisited the amendment and affirmed the âfundamental principleâ that Congress may not âalter or destroyâ debts already incurred .House Republicans threatening to refuse to raise the debt ceiling â that is , force a repudiation of debts already accrued â would violate that âfundamental principleâ of the Constitution .Surely the lawyers advising and defending the White House , let alone the president , know as much . Refraining from stating this loudly and clearly , and allowing Congress to slip off the hook , has been a puzzling and self-defeating strategy , leading to the crippling sequester and the politics of chronic debt-ceiling crisis . More important , by failing to clarify the constitutional principles involved , the administration has neglected to do its utmost to defend the Constitution .
WASHINGTON — It is the morning of Wednesday , Nov. 7 , and after a long night of celebrating and a short night of sleep , Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan wake up to confront the question awaiting every new administration : Of the campaign’s many promises , which few will become the real priorities ?If they win the White House , Republicans are also more likely than not to hold on to the House of Representatives and win a narrow majority in the Senate . The party could then embark on the kind of aggressive legislative push that President Obama and the Democrats did in 2009 .Only four years after Democrats seemed on the verge of historic policy gains , Republicans could reverse many of those gains and then some . They could cut the top tax rate to its lowest level in 80 years ( as Mr. Romney proposes ) and make major changes to federal programs .Above all , a sweep of Washington could make possible the sort of change Republicans have been talking about for three decades without having yet done : a significant shrinking of government . Ronald Reagan cut domestic programs somewhat but expanded the military , while George W. Bush talked about small government but actually made it bigger . Next year , though , really could be different .Even if Mr. Romney is not the obvious vehicle for the Tea Party revolution , his campaign and his selection of Mr. Ryan for vice president suggest he is game . “His choice of Ryan , ” says Grover Norquist , the anti-tax activist , “answers any questions about whether he is for dramatically reducing the cost of government.” Congressional Republicans may force the issue anyway , arguing that their victories demand wholesale change .“We’re having a real debate about the size and scope of government , ” says Senator John Cornyn of Texas , who is overseeing the Republicans’ Senate campaigns . “If Governor Romney and Congressman Ryan win , as I expect they will , they can justly claim a mandate , and I think it will make it much easier to do the hard things we all know need to be done.”Already , Republicans are starting to think ahead , as is only natural . A Romney transition team , known as “The Readiness Project , ” has begun meeting . In 2008 , similarly , Obama aides began discussing whether health care or climate policy should be the top priority , a hugely consequential decision .For a Romney administration , one of the first questions will be how much to use a legislative process known as reconciliation . Under reconciliation , filibusters are prohibited and only a simple majority of 51 Senate votes , rather than 60 , is needed . With Democrats likely to oppose the Romney agenda overwhelmingly and a couple of Republican moderates potentially having qualms , reconciliation would likely play a big role in 2013 .“To the extent that we can get Democrats to buy into it , great , ” Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio , a conservative House leader , told me . “But we need to go there and do what we told the voters we were going to do.” Mr. Cornyn said , “There are a whole lot of very important things you can do with 51 votes.”Norman J. Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute describes the plan as “the mother of all reconciliation bills.”Congress would first pass a temporary delay of the fiscal cliff — the tax increases and spending cuts set to take effect , for a variety of reasons , on Jan. 1 . Mr. Romney might need to sign such a bill retroactively , assuming victorious Republicans and a lame-duck Mr. Obama did not reach a compromise in late 2012 .Republicans could then turn to long-term priorities . On taxes , the crucial decision will be whether to pursue a tax-code overhaul , with lower rates and fewer tax breaks . Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan have each proposed an overhaul , but they have not specified which tax breaks they would reduce to keep their rate cuts from adding to the deficit . And the large tax breaks , like those for health insurance and mortgage interest , are popular .If a full overhaul is going to happen , the mostly likely approach may be a ceiling on how many overall tax breaks someone could claim , avoiding a series of lobbying fights over each break . Martin S. Feldstein , a longtime Republican economist , has proposed such a plan . One of Mr. Ryan’s budget plans contains a related idea , in which people can opt into a simpler tax code .But given how hard tax reform is under any circumstance , the fallback may be a simple tax cut , making the Bush tax cuts permanent and taking some rates lower . Republicans would have to endure criticism that they were violating Mr. Romney’s campaign pledges , by reducing the affluent’s relative tax burden and adding to the deficit . They could counter that future economic growth would solve the problems , even if independent analysts disagreed .Mr. Norquist and many conservatives say they could support a simple tax cut . Byron Dorgan , the former Democratic senator from North Dakota , says of the Republicans , “They value tax cuts more than virtually anything , including the deficit , and I think they’ve demonstrated that.”On health care , the initial focus may not be Medicare , despite the campaign attention it has received . ( Mr. Romney has promised not to touch current benefits , which suggests that he may first pursue modest changes , like pilot programs reducing the government’s role . ) A Romney administration may instead focus on two less politically perilous areas : Mr. Obama’s health law and Medicaid , which covers many poor people and much long-term care for the elderly .Although Republicans could not repeal all of Mr. Obama’s health law with reconciliation , they could undo most of the insurance expansion , because it relies on government subsidies for the uninsured . Congress could also shrink Medicaid , which covers about one in six Americans . “You turn the money over to states , ” says Douglas Holtz-Eakin , president of the American Action Forum , a conservative research group , “and you promise less money.” Mr. Ryan’s budget envisions 75 percent less Medicaid spending than now projected .Beyond health care , Mr. Romney and Congressional Republicans have called for large cuts in federal programs . They have not specified those cuts , but because they would exempt the military , most other areas would likely take significant reductions .What would the combined effects of the new Republican revolution be ? Some government agencies would probably become less wasteful , learning to do more with less , and the private sector would take over some government functions . But those would not be the only changes . The American economy would also devote fewer of its resources to the areas that do not naturally create opportunities for profit in a free market : mass transportation , road building , early-stage scientific research , many aspects of education and public safety .Whether you love that idea or hate it , it certainly would be different . Around the world , the historical pattern has been for government to grow as a society becomes richer and citizens vote for more of the services that the market often does not provide by itself . Federal spending makes up 22 percent of the American economy today , up from 3 percent a century ago .In an aging society coping with a globalized economy , where health care and education continue to grow more ambitious and expensive , the country has a choice to make . It can allow government to continue expanding . Or , as a Romney administration would , it can take a more laissez-faire path than any wealthy country has previously tried .
TUSCALOOSA , Ala. — THE United States Constitution speaks of the Supreme Court’s jurisdiction over “cases” and “controversies.” But when social controversies do come before the court , its powers are limited . In Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores , which concerned the dispute over the Affordable Care Act’s contraceptive mandate , the court may have decided the case . The larger controversy , however , won’t be settled so easily .By a 5-to-4 vote , the court on Monday held that the mandate , which requires employers to provide health insurance coverage for contraception , could not be applied to closely held for-profit corporations with religious objections to some forms of contraception . Religious groups described the mandate as part of a war on religious freedom . Supporters of the mandate countered that a victory for the plaintiffs would allow large corporations , under the cover of religious freedom , not just to impede women’s exercise of their reproductive rights but also to defy civil rights statutes with impunity .Amid this heated talk , it was easy to lose sight of the fact that this was a statutory case , not a case decided under the First Amendment’s protection of freedom of religion . The statute in question , the Religious Freedom Restoration Act , states that the government “shall not substantially burden” the exercise of religion without satisfying a demanding legal test .It is worth noting that the act was championed by President Bill Clinton and passed in 1993 , with near unanimity , by a Democrat-controlled Congress . The act was drafted in response to a controversial 1990 Supreme Court decision that made it easier — far too easy , according to critics of all political stripes — for the government to burden the exercise of religion .The decision in Hobby Lobby was no shock to anyone familiar with the heavy weight that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act places on religious accommodation . The fate of the case was sealed 21 years ago — not by a slim majority of the court , but by virtually every member of Congress . In a dissenting opinion on Monday , Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg argued that the court’s ruling in Hobby Lobby was one of “startling breadth , ” but the statute itself is deliberately broad .So why all the shouting ? If the Religious Freedom Restoration Act is clearly written , and the product of a democratic process , what explains the apocalyptic rhetoric surrounding this case ? In truth , the sources of the controversy lie outside the issue of the contraceptive mandate itself . And that should be great cause for concern — to both sides of the debate .The first source of controversy is the collapse of a national consensus on a key element of religious liberty : accommodation . Throughout American history , there has been widespread agreement that in our religiously diverse and widely devout country , it is good for the government to accommodate religious exercise . We have disagreed about particular accommodations ( may a Muslim police officer wear a beard , despite police department policy ? ) , and especially about whether religious accommodations should be ordered by judges or crafted by legislators . But we have generally agreed that our nation benefits when we help rather than burden those with religious obligations . That consensus seems , quite suddenly , to have evaporated .A second source of controversy is that many people view the Hobby Lobby case as concerning not just reproductive rights but also , indirectly , rights for gays and lesbians . Advocates for same-sex marriage have long insisted that their own marriages need not threaten anyone else’s , but citizens with religious objections to same-sex marriage wonder whether that is entirely true : Will a small-business owner be sued , for instance , for declining to provide services to a same-sex couple ? Conversely , and understandably , gay and lesbian couples wonder why they do not deserve the same protections from discrimination granted to racial and other minorities . For both sides , Hobby Lobby was merely a prelude to this dawning conflict .The third source of controversy is a change in our views of the marketplace itself . The marketplace was once seen as place to put aside our culture wars and engage in the great American tradition of buying and selling . The shopping mall has even been called the “American agora.” But today the market itself has become a site of cultural conflict . Hobby Lobby is one of many companies that seek to express faith commitments at work as well as at home and that don’t see the workplace as a thing apart from religion . Many companies preach and practice values , religious and otherwise , that are unrelated to market considerations . CVS , for example , recently announced that it would stop selling tobacco products , regardless of how that decision might affect its bottom line .A country that can not even agree on the idea of religious accommodation , let alone on what terms , is unlikely to agree on what to do next . A country in which many states can not manage to pass basic anti-discrimination laws covering sexual orientation is one whose culture wars may be beyond the point of compromise . And a nation whose marketplace itself is viewed , for better or worse , as a place to fight both those battles rather than to escape from them is still less likely to find surcease from struggle .Expect many more Hobby Lobbies .
What’s the most common chronic childhood disease in the United States ? It’s worth remembering on Halloween that the answer is tooth decay , which is five times more common than asthma and 20 times more common than diabetes .Tooth decay affects children from all backgrounds , but it’s concentrated among low-income and rural populations , who have the most difficulty accessing and affording dental care . Most dentists in private practice don’t accept Medicaid or public insurance , and tens of million of Americans live in areas with dentist shortages . In 2008 , only about a third of children on Medicaid received dental care under the program ( PDF ) . ( The elderly and people with disabilities are also badly underserved . ) In 2009 , untreated , preventable dental problems led to 830,000 emergency room visits .The United States health care system has many absurdities , but one of the craziest is that it treats the mouth as if it were disconnected from the rest of the body . It’s easier , and more affordable , to get treated for an infection in , say , the toe .From a health perspective , this makes no sense . “Your mouth is an essential human organ system , ” said Leon A. Assael , dean of the School of Dentistry at the University of Minnesota . “And tooth decay will destroy it through an infectious process that [ if untreated ] will go deep into the bone of your jaw and spread into your blood stream with potentially negative systemic consequence.” Dental disease is connected to many health problems and is particularly worrisome for pregnant women and diabetics .One approach gaining momentum in the United States to extend access to underserved groups is based on an idea that was pioneered in New Zealand 93 years ago , and has been adopted in more than 50 countries . The idea is to train “dental therapists , ” who , like dental hygienists , work under the supervision of dentists , but who can also drill teeth and perform non-complex extractions .So far , in the United States , dental therapists provide care in three states . In Alaska , they work in 80 villages , serving about 40,000 Alaska Natives on tribal lands . “Most of them didn’t have a dental provider working or living in their communities previously , ” said Mary Williard , a dentist who heads the Dental Health Aide Training Program for the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium . In 2009 , Minnesota authorized the training of dental therapists to serve predominately low-income patients . Maine recently followed suit .The American Dental Association has resisted the idea for decades , arguing that it doesn’t make economic sense and will consign some people to second-class care . “I always smile when I hear the term ‘simple extraction , ’ ” said Maxine Feinberg , the association’s president . “I’ve been a dentist for a long time and one never knows what’s going to happen with an extraction.”However , researchers have found dental therapy to be safe and reliable , particularly for treating children , whose care is less complex than that of adults . “The evidence internationally is that you can provide outstanding care to children with dental therapists in school-based programs , ” said David A. Nash , a professor of dental education at the University of Kentucky , and a lead author of a major report on the practice ( PDF ) . Two reports released this summer by the Pew Charitable Trusts also suggested that dental therapists were cost-effective in public clinics and private dental offices .More than a dozen states are now exploring the model , part of a general trend in medicine to broaden access to care and rein in costs by reducing the dependency on specialists for care that can be well managed by others . “When you look at the advent of nurse practitioners , and physician assistants , and even dental hygienists , there’s always resistance initially , ” said Shelly Gehshan , director of children’s dental policy at the Pew Charitable Trusts . “But after a couple of years it fades . Once five or six states authorize dental therapists , it will hit a tipping point . It’s really a question of when it will become part of the dental system , not if.”Among proponents of dental therapy , there is one key area of disagreement . Globally , dental therapists have mainly been placed in schools , and some researchers recommend that the United States remain faithful to this model . “This is really the only place where dental therapy has truly been proven economical and effective , ” said Jay W. Friedman , a dentist and leading researcher who has studied the subject extensively . “And children should receive priority consideration . They are basically ‘non-ambulatory.’ If you don’t have someone take them to a dentist , then you have to bring the dental care to them.”In the United States , by contrast , dental therapists are being placed in public clinics , private practices and federally qualified health centers , and they are permitted to treat adults as well as children . The AARP supports dental therapy to improve care for elderly people , whose need is also great .In Alaska , after two years of post-secondary training , therapists may see patients on their own . Their supervising dentists are often a long way away , reachable by plane , boat or snowmobile ( see this map ) . Despite this fact , studies suggest that their care is effective and in line with their expertise ( PDF ) .“The studies showed that the therapists were providing services that were appropriate and weren’t doing things that didn’t need to be done , ” Williard said . “They were making good judgment calls and practicing less invasively.”One advantage is that the therapists come from the Alaska Native communities they serve ; they can connect better with patients and are more likely to continue to live among them . ( Dentists from minority groups are more likely to treat minority patients , but the vast majority of dentists are white . ) “The therapists also study how to do motivational interviewing techniques to help patients change their behaviors , ” Williard said . “In the stores , the kids see them and say , ‘Oh no , the therapist is here . I shouldn’t buy this soda pop.’ Those kinds of things are hard to quantify but are really important.”In Minnesota , the state legislature has created two dental therapist roles — a four-year bachelor’s degree and a two-year master’s degree — and providers are required to practice as part of a team , with a dentist in the office . To date , 42 therapists have received licenses and 35 are employed . The state’s early impact study reported that they were , as intended , serving thousands of new , predominantly low-income and uninsured patients , practicing safely , lowering costs , and improving patient satisfaction .The People’s Center Health Services , a federally qualified health center in South Minneapolis , provides care primarily to immigrants from Somalia and Ethiopia . It has two dental therapists and is looking to bring on a third . “They’re a tremendous resource , ” explained Ashley Johnson , the center’s chief dental officer . “With the Affordable Care Act , we have more people flooding in . Many have never had dental care before . A lot of kids come in with rampant dental decay . The therapists are able to do quite a bit of dental work and allow the dentists to focus on patients who have more complex problems , like root canals and implants.”“Due to low reimbursement rates , dentists can not afford to treat tooth decay in most practices in Minnesota for patients on public assistance for whom the reimbursement is just 38 percent of usual fees , ” said Leon Assael of the University of Minnesota’s School of Dentistry , one of two schools in the state to train dental therapists . “Dental therapists reduce the unit cost of care by treating patients with dental decay on public assistance who would not otherwise be seen in the dental practice.”And for some ideas on how children can enjoy Halloween fun and keep their mouths healthy , see this advice from the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry .Join Fixes on Facebook and follow updates on twitter.com/nytimesfixes .

THOUGH the recent release of Medicare’s physician payments cast a spotlight on the millions of dollars paid to some specialists , there is a startling secret behind America’s health care hierarchy : Physicians , the most highly trained members in the industry’s work force , are on average right in the middle of the compensation pack .That is because the biggest bucks are currently earned not through the delivery of care , but from overseeing the business of medicine .The base pay of insurance executives , hospital executives and even hospital administrators often far outstrips doctors’ salaries , according to an analysis performed for The New York Times by Compdata Surveys : $ 584,000 on average for an insurance chief executive officer , $ 386,000 for a hospital C.E.O . and $ 237,000 for a hospital administrator , compared with $ 306,000 for a surgeon and $ 185,000 for a general doctor .And those numbers almost certainly understate the payment gap , since top executives frequently earn the bulk of their income in nonsalary compensation . In a deal that is not unusual in the industry , Mark T. Bertolini , the chief executive of Aetna , earned a salary of about $ 977,000 in 2012 but a total compensation package of over $ 36 million , the bulk of it from stocks vested and options he exercised that year . Likewise , Ronald J. Del Mauro , a former president of Barnabas Health , a midsize health system in New Jersey , earned a salary of just $ 28,000 in 2012 , the year he retired , but total compensation of $ 21.7 million .The proliferation of high earners in the medical business and administration ranks adds to the United States’ $ 2.7 trillion health care bill and stands in stark contrast with other developed countries , where top-ranked hospitals have only skeleton administrative staffs and where health care workers are generally paid less . And many experts say it’s bad value for health care dollars .“At large hospitals there are senior V.P.s , V.P.s of this , that and the other , ” said Cathy Schoen , senior vice president for policy , research and evaluation at the Commonwealth Fund , a New York-based foundation that focuses on health care . “Each one of them is paid more than before , and more than in any other country.”She added , “The pay for the top five or 10 executives at insurers is pretty astounding — way more than a highly trained surgeon.”She said that executive salaries in health care “increased hugely in the ‘90s” and that the trend has continued . For example , in addition to Mr. Del Mauro’s $ 21.7 million package , Barnabas Health listed more than 20 vice presidents who earned over $ 350,000 on its latest available tax return ; the new chief executive earned about $ 3 million . Data released by Medicare show that Barnabas Health’s hospitals bill more than twice the national average for many procedures . ( In 2006 , the hospital paid one of the largest Medicare fines ever to settle fraud charges brought by federal prosecutors . )Hospitals and insurers maintain that large pay packages are necessary to attract top executives who have the expertise needed to cope with the complex structure of American health care , where hospitals and insurers undertake hundreds of negotiations to set prices .Ellen Greene , a spokeswoman for Barnabas Health , said Mr. Del Mauro’s retirement package was “a function of over four decades of service and reflects his exceptional legacy.” Nearly $ 14 million was a cumulative payout from a deferred retirement plan , she said , and the remainder included base compensation , a bonus and an incentive planMs. Greene also said Barnabas’s compensation program follows I.R.S . rules and is established by an executive compensation committee with “guidance from a nationally recognized compensation consultant.”In many areas , the health care industry is home to the top earning executives in the nonprofit sector .And studies suggest that administrative costs make up 20 to 30 percent of the United States health care bill , far higher than in any other country . American insurers , meanwhile , spent $ 606 per person on administrative costs , more than twice as much as in any other developed country and more than three times as much as many , according to a study by the Commonwealth Fund .As a result of the system’s complexity , there are many jobs descriptions for positions that often don’t exist elsewhere : medical coders , claims adjusters , medical device brokers , drug purchasers — not to mention the “navigators” created by the Affordable Care Act .Among doctors , there is growing frustration over the army of businesspeople around them and the impact of administrative costs , which are reflected in inflated charges for medical services .“Most doctors want to do well by their patients , ” said Dr. Abeel A. Mangi , a cardiothoracic surgeon at the Yale School of Medicine , who is teaming up with a group at the Yale School of Management to better evaluate cost and outcomes in his department . “Other constituents , such as device manufacturers , pharmaceutical companies and even hospital administrators , may not necessarily have that perspective.”Doctors are beginning to push back : Last month , 75 doctors in northern Wisconsin took out an advertisement in The Wisconsin State Journal demanding widespread health reforms to lower prices , including penalizing hospitals for overbuilding and requiring that 95 percent of insurance premiums be used on medical care . The movement was ignited when a surgeon , Dr. Hans Rechsteiner , discovered that a brief outpatient appendectomy he had performed for a fee of $ 1,700 generated over $ 12,000 in hospital bills , including $ 6,500 for operating room and recovery room charges .It’s worth noting that the health care industry is staffed by some of the lowest as well as highest paid professionals in any business . The average staff nurse is paid about $ 61,000 a year , and an emergency medical technician earns just about minimum wage , for a yearly income of $ 27,000 , according to the Compdata analysis . Many medics work two or three jobs to make ends meet .“It’s stressful , dirty , hard work , and the burnout rate is high , ” said Tom McNulty , a 19-year-old college student who volunteers for an ambulance corps outside Rochester . Though he finds it fulfilling , he said he would not make it a career : “Financially , it’s not feasible.”
The Times has a very nice survey of the results to date of the Affordable Care Act , aka Obamacare , aka death panels and the moral equivalent of slavery .The verdict : It’s going well . A big expansion in coverage , which is affordable for a large majority ; the main exceptions seem to be people who went for the minimum coverage allowed , keeping premiums down but leaving large co-payments . None of the predictions of disaster has come even slightly true .
The good news about Obamacare so far shouldn’t be considered disputable . Enrollments really are above target ; multiple independent surveys show a sharp drop in the uninsured population ; health care cost growth really has slowed dramatically , whatever the reason ; the newly insured are generally satisfied with their coverage . If you want to insist that big problems lie ahead , fine ( but please explain ) , but the facts so far are pretty good .But what I’m getting — and what you get whenever you suggest that things are going OK — is an outpouring , not so much of disagreement , as of fury . People get red-in-the-face angry , practically to the point of incoherence , over the suggestion that it’s not a disaster .What’s that about ? Partly it may be Obama derangement syndrome . I was struck by mail I received after my last column accusing me of shilling for Obama and refusing to admit what a disaster he’s been — when the column didn’t so much as mention the guy . Obamacare was a label stuck on the Affordable Care Act by its opponents , to tie the president to the disaster to come ; now they’re livid that it , and he , are turning out OK .Partly it may be general hatred for any kind of program that helps the less fortunate , especially if they happen to be , you know , not white . Such programs must be disasters — don’t bother me with evidence .And partly , I suspect , there’s now an element of shame . If this thing is actually working , everyone who yelled about how it would be a disaster ends up looking fairly stupid .But , you know , sometimes looks don’t deceive .
RISING health care costs are busting the federal budget as well as those of states , counties and municipalities . Policy makers and health care leaders have spent decades trying to figure out what to do about this .Yet their solutions are failing because of a fundamental and largely unrecognized problem : We don’t know what it costs to deliver health care to individual patients , much less how those costs compare to the outcomes achieved .When insurance companies or government bodies try to control costs , they usually make across-the-board reimbursement cuts that ultimately are unsustainable because they have no connection to the true costs of delivering care . Providers themselves do not measure their costs correctly . They assign costs to patients based on what they charge , not on the actual costs of the resources , like personnel and equipment , used to care for the patient . The result is that attempts to cut costs fail , and total health care costs just keep rising .Regardless of what decision the Supreme Court reaches on the legality of the Affordable Care Act , measuring outcomes and costs is indispensable to driving improvements .Because health care charges and reimbursements have become disconnected from actual costs , some procedures are reimbursed very generously , while others are priced below their actual cost or not reimbursed at all . This leads many providers to expand into well-reimbursed procedures , like knee and hip replacements or high-end imaging , producing huge excess capacity for these at the same time that shortages persist in poorly reimbursed but critical services like primary and preventive care .The lack of cost and outcome information also prevents the forces of competition from working : Hospitals and doctors are reimbursed for performing lots of procedures and tests regardless of whether they are necessary to make their patients get better . Providers who excel and achieve better outcomes with fewer visits , procedures and complications are penalized by being paid less .Our research and executive workshops show that many sites are already improving their measurements of patient outcomes . But they have done little to measure the actual costs of achieving those outcomes . We are currently working with several health care organizations , including MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston , Children’s Hospital Boston , Partners Healthcare in Boston and Schön Klinik in Germany , that are beginning to figure out how to measure costs . They use teams of clinicians and administrators to identify all the processes involved in care , from a patient’s first contact with a health care provider through his or her inpatient stay and outpatient follow-up care . The teams then identify the quantity and unit cost of each resource — clinical staff , equipment , supplies , devices and administrative support — used in each process and add these together to learn the total cost of a patient’s care .The information helps them discover immediate and significant opportunities for improvements in care and reduced spending . MD Anderson , for example , has studied its evaluation process for new head and neck cancer patients . By substituting trained staff members for physicians , standardizing processes and improving information technology , it has been able to make care more efficient without any adverse effect on patient outcomes . It has made changes that reduced total costs by 36 percent , and freed employees to serve more patients without adding to costs .A surgeon repairing cleft palates at Children’s Hospital Boston discovered that 40 percent of the total cost of an 18-month-care process was due to the time a child spent in the intensive care unit before and after surgery . By using a far less intensively staffed and equipped observation room , the hospital could achieve equivalent quality and safety at much lower costs .Most health care providers have hundreds of these opportunities to use time , equipment and facilities more intelligently . These opportunities have been obscured by existing costing systems that have little connection to the processes actually performed .With accurate information on outcomes and costs , providers can improve care and save money by eliminating things that don’t help the patient , like multiple check-ins and medical histories , tests that provide little new information and long waiting times . Many routine tasks are performed today by highly trained doctors and nurses . These tasks can be shifted to others , freeing the most skilled clinicians for far more productive work .Health care providers with expensive and poorly utilized equipment , space and staff can see the benefits of consolidating services to improve utilization and reduce some existing capacity . They can also perform routine services in lower-cost locations , reserving expensive medical centers for complex care .These opportunities will allow the health care needs of an aging population to be met with little need to increase spending . Understanding costs could be the single most powerful lever to transform the value of health care . This would give payers and providers the data they need to improve patient care , and to stop arbitrary cuts and counterproductive cost shifting .
I WAS standing by my 89-year-old mother’s hospital bed when she asked a doctor , “Is there anything you can do here to give me back the life I had last year , when I wasn’t in pain every minute ? ” The young medical resident , stunned by the directness of the question , blurted out , “Honestly , ma’am , no.”And so Irma Broderick Jacoby went home and lived another year , during which she never again entered a hospital or subjected herself to an invasive , expensive medical procedure . The pain of multiple degenerative diseases was eased by prescription drugs , and she died last November after two weeks in a hospice , on terms determined by explicit legal instructions and discussions with her children — no respirators , no artificial feeding , no attempts to buy one more day for a body that would not let her turn over in bed or swallow without agony .The hospice room and pain-relieving palliative care cost only about $ 400 a day , while the average hospital stay costs Medicare over $ 6,000 a day . Although Mom’s main concern was her comfort and dignity , she also took satisfaction in not running up Medicare payments for unwanted treatments and not leaving private medical bills for her children to pay . A third of the Medicare budget is now spent in the last year of life , and a third of that goes for care in the last month . Those figures would surely be lower if more Americans , while they were still healthy , took the initiative to spell out what treatments they do — and do not — want by writing living wills and appointing health care proxies .As the aging baby boom generation places unprecedented demands on the health care system , there is little ordinary citizens can do — witness the tortuous arguments in the Supreme Court this week over the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act — to influence either the cost or the quality of the treatment they receive . However , end-of-life planning is one of the few actions within the power of individuals who wish to help themselves and their society . Too few Americans are shouldering this responsibility .Of course many people want more aggressive treatment than my mother . And advance directives aren’t “death panels” ; they can also be used to ensure the deployment of every tool of modern medicine . They can be changed or withdrawn at any time by a mentally competent person .But public opinion polls consistently show that most Americans , like my mother , worry about too much rather than too little medical intervention . In a Pew Research Center poll released in 2006 , only 22 percent said a doctor should always try to save a patient’s life , while 70 percent believed that patients should sometimes be allowed to die . More than half said they would tell their doctor to end treatment if they were in great pain with no hope of improvement .Yet only 69 percent had discussed end-of-life care with a spouse ; just 17 percent , or 40 percent of those over 65 , had done so with their children . One-third of Americans had a living will and even fewer have taken the more legally enforceable measure of appointing a health care proxy to act on their behalf if they can not act for themselves .The latter omission is especially disturbing because by 2030 , more than 8.5 million Americans will be over 85 — an age at which roughly half will suffer from Alzheimer’s disease or some other form of irreversible dementia . For many members of the baby boom generation — more likely to be divorced and childless than their parents — there may be no legal next of kin .Without advance directives , even a loving child may be ignorant of her parent’s wishes . My mother remained conscious and in charge of her care until just a few days before she died , but like most women over 85 , she was a widow . My younger brother died of pancreatic cancer two weeks before she did . It was an immense comfort to me , at a terrible time , to have no doubts about what she wanted .My mother drew up her directives in the 1980s , when she was a volunteer in the critical care lounge of her local hospital . She once watched , appalled , as an adult daughter threw a coffeepot at her brother for suggesting that their comatose mother’s respirator be turned off . Because the siblings could not agree and the patient had no living will , she was kept hooked up to machines for another two weeks at a cost ( then ) of nearly $ 80,000 to Medicare and $ 20,000 to her family — even though her doctors agreed there was no hope .The worst imaginable horror for my mother was that she might be kept alive by expensive and painful procedures when she no longer had a functioning brain . She was equally horrified by the idea of family fights around her deathbed . “I don’t want one of you throwing a coffeepot at the other , ” she told us in a half-joking , half-serious fashion .There is a clear contradiction between the value that American society places on personal choice and Americans’ reluctance to make their own decisions , insofar as possible , about the care they will receive as death nears . Obviously , no one likes to think about sickness and death . But the politicization of end-of-life planning and its entwinement with religion-based culture wars provide extra , irrational obstacles to thinking ahead when it matters most .As someone over 65 , I do not consider it my duty to die for the convenience of society . I do consider it my duty , to myself and younger generations , to follow the example my mother set by doing everything in my power to ensure that I will never be the object of medical intervention that can not restore my life but can only prolong a costly living death .

SINCE the early 1970s , studies have shown that black Americans have a higher death rate from cancer than any other racial or ethnic group . This is especially true when it comes to breast cancer . A study published last week in the journal Cancer Epidemiology found that , in a survey of 41 of America’s largest cities , black women with breast cancer are on average 40 percent more likely to die than their white counterparts .The principal reason for this disparity is the disconnect between the nation’s discovery and delivery enterprises — between what we know and what we do about sick Americans .In 1967 , I started working in Harlem as a cancer surgeon . At that time , and through the 1980s , Harlem was a community of poor black people , and the death rate from cancer there was among the highest in the country . At Harlem Hospital , the five-year survival rate for breast cancer was a dismal 39 percent , compared with roughly 75 percent for Americans over all .I imagined that I could “cut cancer out of Harlem.” But I soon learned that the disease would not yield to a surgeon’s knife . Why ? Because the patients were coming in too late . I examined many black women who were visiting the clinic for the first time and who already had incurable breast cancer , sometimes with ulcerated and bleeding breast masses .I began to see that cancer’s invasiveness was deeply rooted in human conditions , and began asking questions such as : What does it mean to be black in America ? What does it mean to be poor ? And what does it mean to be black and poor and at the same time to have cancer ? Saving lives under these conditions has dominated my career ever since .The reasons for black and white differences in breast cancer outcomes are complex . Although the incidence of the disease is higher among white women , black women are more likely to die from it . Young black women tend to develop a particularly aggressive form , which no doubt contributes to the disparity . But for many years , the dominant cause of higher mortality has been late-stage disease at the time of initial treatment , in part as a result of black women being less likely to undergo mammography .However , this gap has been closed . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that the rate of mammography is now the same in black and white women . What remains different is what happens after the mammogram : Black women experience significant delays in diagnosis and treatment . According to the C.D.C. , even when they have similar insurance coverage , 20 percent of black women with an abnormal mammogram wait more than 60 days for a diagnosis , compared with 12 percent of white women . And 31 percent of black women wait 30 days to begin treatment , compared with 18 percent of white women .The Institute of Medicine reported in 2003 that black Americans with health insurance similar to that of white Americans are , at times , less likely to be recommended by physicians to receive curative cancer care . I don’t think this is because doctors are racist , but rather that they make assumptions about race that can be harmful . For example , a specialist treating a poor black woman may doubt that she will comply with a complex treatment and recommend a simpler , but noncurative , therapy instead .The good news is that studies show that black and white women who receive the same breast cancer treatment at the same stage of the disease are equally likely to survive . If we can eliminate barriers to early diagnosis and quality treatment in black women , we can close the racial mortality gap .In 1971 , Richard M. Nixon declared a “war on cancer” and signed the National Cancer Act , resulting in well-justified increases in the nation’s investment in cancer research . But the act said nothing about the other crucial aspect of saving lives : the delivery of care . As a result , not all Americans have benefited equally from scientific and medical progress .Similarly , in recent years , the debate has focused on screening , with much less concern about what happens after . We should be expanding access to mammograms and colonoscopies , and debating the frequency and ages at which they are offered . But today , too many people are reluctant to undergo screening at all , because they fear they can not afford treatment if they are found to have cancer . Screening is much less effective if we can not ensure access to timely care .At Harlem Hospital , we provided free breast cancer screening beginning in 1979 . But screening alone was not enough . Patients — who not only often lacked health insurance , but also struggled with a limited education and distrust of doctors — needed help making their way through the medical system . So in 1990 , we pioneered the patient navigation program , which provided one-on-one support to patients with abnormal findings . The navigators helped patients obtain insurance , made sure they understood what was recommended , guided them through appointments and allayed their fears . Applying the two interventions in Harlem — breast cancer screening and patient navigation — raised the five-year breast cancer survival rate from 39 percent to 70 percent in 2000 .In 2005 , President George W. Bush signed the Patient Navigator Outreach and Chronic Disease Prevention Act , based on the Harlem model , which provided funds for these programs . In 2012 , the American College of Surgeons made patient navigation a standard of care , required for cancer centers seeking accreditation beginning next year . And the Affordable Care Act required that patient navigators be used to help Americans obtain insurance under the exchanges .The health care reform act is an excellent start toward providing universal health insurance . But access to insurance does not assure access to quality health care , especially for the poor and less educated . No patient with cancer should go untreated or experience a delay in treatment that diminishes survival . People should not die from cancer because they are poor or black . This is more than a medical and scientific issue . This is a moral issue .

Today , the solution he developed could transform health care .Arora had been specializing since 1990 on the treatment of chronic hepatitis C , a disease that affects 3 million Americans ( and 170 million people around the world ) . Most Americans don’t know they’re infected , which is one reason why it remains the leading cause of cirrhosis and liver cancer , resulting in 15,000 deaths each year in the United States , and 350,000 deaths globally .In 1990 , when drugs started emerging to treat the disease , the cure rate was just 6 percent . By 2003 , however , the cure rate had climbed to 45 percent for some patients , and 70 percent for others ( depending on their genotypes ) . “It had become a curable disease , ” Arora recalled . ( New medications have further improved the efficacy , safety and ease of treatment for hepatitis C , but high costs remain a barrier . )The few specialists in New Mexico who treated it were in urban centers , and most patients went without treatment . Those who sought help had to wait six to eight months to get an appointment in a clinic . Many could not afford to drive hundreds of miles to Albuquerque , let alone make an average of 12 to 18 trips to complete a course of treatment .The result : less than 5 percent of the estimated 34,000 chronic hepatitis C patients in New Mexico had been treated . It was estimated that 2,400 inmates in New Mexico’s prisons were infected with the hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) . As of 2003 , not one had received treatment for it .“The people who weren’t very sick yet couldn’t get into the clinics , ” Arora said . “And the people who got in already had liver cancer or their liver was failing and it was too late to treat . So it was very frustrating . The thought came to me : If only I could expand my capacity in some way , and reflect my expertise on a much larger number of patients , lives could be saved.”Could a system be built to “demonopolize” health care knowledge ? To move it out of the heads of specialists into networks of primary care providers in remote places so they could manage complex illnesses in their local settings ? And could rural clinicians provide care that was on a par with specialists ?Arora set out traveling around New Mexico , recruiting local providers one by one , explaining how hepatitis C was killing their patients , that there were effective treatments for it , but they were complicated to manage . He made an offer . If they volunteered to spend two hours a week with him , he and other specialists would work with them in close collaboration until they could manage their own cases .People came on board and Project ECHO came to life . In Albuquerque , Arora pulled together a team of specialists and they developed a model that combined video conferencing technology to facilitate weekly case-based training ( similar to the teaching approach in medical schools ) with collaborative care and careful patient tracking . With funding from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation , Project ECHO spread across the state .In 2011 , the New England Journal of Medicine published a study that compared the cure rates of patients treated at the University of New Mexico’s HCV clinic with those treated by primary care clinicians in 21 remote ECHO sites , including federal and state run health centers and five prisons . The study reported that the primary care clinicians achieved slightly better cure rates and their patients had fewer serious adverse events . The research suggested that , when treated in local settings , patients adhered better to treatments ; and primary care doctors more familiar with patients’ medical histories and personal situations could better coordinate care and anticipate problems .This is an example of what the Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen has called a “disruptive innovation” — an innovation that enables a large number of people who previously lacked resources or skills to do or get something important , often by themselves . What it’s doing is moving complex expertise to the front lines of the health care system , observed Nancy Barrand , a senior adviser at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation , which has worked closely with Project ECHO .Donald Berwick , the former administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , who is currently running for governor of Massachusetts , observed that Project ECHO’s model represents a fundamental design shift — “from moving the patient to moving the knowledge” — that is needed to build a health care system capable of meeting today’s soaring demands for care . “They’ve shown that with proper support the primary care workforce , including nurses , not just doctors , can function to very high levels of precision with highly complex care , ” Berwick said .Others agree . Over the past five years , Project ECHO ( short for Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes ) has spread well beyond its initial focus . It now supports ECHO hubs anchored out of 31 universities assisting providers in more than a thousand clinics who focus on 26 specialties including rheumatology ( video ) , H.I.V. , addiction , women’s health , hypertension , dementia , breast cancer , childhood obesity , diabetes and chronic pain . ( Beyond the United States , the model is being used in India , Uruguay , the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland . )In 2012 , the Center for Disease Control and Prevention sponsored a replication of ECHO in Utah and Arizona , using the model to work with 90 primary care providers , 96 percent of whom had never treated a single patient with HCV . “Within a year the proportion of patients treated in ECHO was twice the proportion treated in urban areas , ” said John W. Ward , who directs the Division of Viral Hepatitis at the C.D.C . “It turned non-treaters into super-treaters.”ECHO has also helped the Veteran’s Administration set up 11 hubs connected to 300 clinics around the country . It’s working with the U.S. Department of Defense to improve the way the Army manages chronic pain globally ( video ) , and it recently formed a partnership with the Military Health System to set up ECHO projects within the Navy and Airforce .Through a partnership with the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation , ECHO is also helping doctors , nurse practitioners , case managers and community health workers to prevent hospitalizations among patients with multiple chronic diseases in New Mexico and Washington state .Recently , I joined a hepatitis C video conference led by Project ECHO’s associate director , Karla Thornton , a specialist in infectious diseases , to see how it works . On my screen were a dozen live feeds : a team of specialists from the University of New Mexico and clinicians from places around the state like Las Cruces and Gallup and the Santa Fe Indian Hospital . They worked through cases briskly , in a collegial manner , with lots of feedback .Each case presented a different challenge . Hepatitis C treatments can be toxic , so they have to be closely managed . In one case , a 55-year-old man had grown severely depressed , a common side effect of treatment with the drug interferon . Should treatment be continued ? Lab reports appeared on screen . There were discussions of viral loads , hemoglobin levels , the ALT test , which reveals liver damage . Best to stop treatment for now .Another patient , a 58-year-old Native American woman with cirrhosis , had , after multiple requests by her doctors , gotten insurance coverage for the new drug , Sovaldi . Her viral load was now undetectable , but platelets and ANCs ( a measure of a type of white blood cell ) were worrisome . Could she come in weekly or even twice weekly to the clinic to watch for infection ? Was she a transplant candidate ?Each case presented an opportunity to connect state of the art care to front-line treatment , something the health care system does not do well . ( In 2001 , the Institute of Medicine reported that it took an average of 17 years for new evidence to be incorporated into health care practice . )The variety of cases was interesting and useful for teaching . “In a period of two hours I could see three patients in my clinic , ” said Thornton . “In that teleconference , we heard about 18 patients . For me , it’s so much more gratifying than just doing it one on one.”“You learn so much by listening to other people’s cases , ” said Laura Bush , a family nurse practitioner , at First Choice Community Healthcare , in Valencia County , 30 miles south of Albuquerque . “When I hear someone else’s presentation , I’ll think , ‘Oh , I need to ask about that . Or why did they do that ? Maybe something’s changed.’ Or something gets questioned by Dr. Arora or Dr. Thornton and they explain , ‘We’re doing this because of this study . Or this treatment would be more efficacious for this genotype.’ Hearing the same information with different cases , you start to develop pattern recognition.”One of the big forces driving up health care costs is the demand for high priced specialty care — and the cost of providing it . But how do you brings costs down , and standardize quality , when demand is outstripping supply ? That’s a problem many clinicians are facing — particularly those in the military — with regard to complex pain management .When Col. Kevin Galloway , Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army Pain Management Task Force , heard about Project ECHO , his first reaction was : “We’re already doing this . We’re the military . Of course we’re leveraging technology.”Galloway had been using telemedicine since his days as a lieutenant in Yugoslavia in the 1990s . But that was a linear application of technology , he said . While a specialist sitting in Landstuhl Regional Medical Center was seeing patients by video , he wasn’t seeing patients in his clinic . “So it was not really working on the capacity issue , ” he said . By contrast , Arora characterizes ECHO as a “force multiplier.”“What we didn’t know was that the ECHO model [ had ] repurposed it in a way that was building capacity in the remote locations , ” Galloway added . “It was teaching a man to fish rather than giving him a fish . It allowed us a way to grow and manage the transformation all across army medicine pain care.”It’s no accident that ECHO emerged in Albuquerque , rather than , say , Boston . One of the principles of disruptive innovations is that they often emerge where there is nothing else to compete with . “It probably couldn’t have been successful if it hadn’t started in poor areas with patients that nobody else was serving , ” said Barrand .The Army has had to work to encourage its pain specialists to rethink their fundamental roles , to see themselves as mentors and collaborators on a level playing field with primary caregivers , said Galloway . “It’s not good enough to have smart people sitting in specialty care if they hold that knowledge to themselves.”This approach runs up against the stratifications of the American health system , where specialists now stand to earn two to four times as much money as primary care doctors on average — one reason only 25 percent of new physicians are going into primary care . At the same time , physicians and nurses are suffering from high levels of burnout and depression .In this context , one of the potential attractions of Project ECHO is the satisfaction it offers through collaboration . “I’ve developed relationships with many primary care providers , ” said Thornton . “They call me all the time . We have this sort of community of practice that’s very enjoyable to be a part of.”Those relationships can be particularly enriching to clinicians in rural settings . Lore Pease , Chief Executive Officer of El Centro Family Health in Española , which covers an area of 22,000 square miles in northern New Mexico , says Project ECHO has helped her to retain providers , a major challenge in rural areas . “We’ve had providers who’ve told us , ‘I won’t stay long , ’ but they do , ” she said . “Because we can offer a specialty for them to learn and expand their knowledge and expertise . It’s a whole new adventure and a whole new challenge.”A big barrier Project ECHO faces as it continues to spread is the way we pay for health care — the fee-for-service model , which currently provides little monetary incentive for clinicians to exchange knowledge this way , even if in the long term society stands to save oodles of money by strengthening primary care .Currently , primary care clinicians volunteer their time to participate in video clinics , and they typically earn less by seeing complex patients , because they get paid per visit and these visits take more time . Specialists get paid primarily through grants . Project ECHO received major support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to expand the model in New Mexico and Washington state , and later to spread nationally . The project has also received funding from the GE and Helmsley Foundations , as well as federal and state government sources . But for ECHO to become a national model governments and insurance companies will need to advance a standardized reimbursement approach to support its work .It’s hard to imagine that these changes won’t gain more traction . Under the Affordable Care Act , 32 million Americans are expected to gain coverage and many will be coming from underserved rural and urban areas , and will have chronic illnesses . How will they be cared for ? “At some point in the future I can’t imagine a primary care clinician not connected to an ECHO clinic , ” says Barrand . “It wouldn’t make sense.”“ECHO is allowing clinicians to reconnect with the reasons for being a doctor , ” adds Arora . “It’s about working to enhance your knowledge , to develop yourself as a professional , and to deliver the highest quality care for the right reasons . And it’s about building a community to solve a major problem in society.”Join Fixes on Facebook and follow updates on twitter.com/nytimesfixes .

LOS ANGELES â MUCH of the discussion over the Affordable Care Act has focused on whether it will bring down health care costs . Less attention has been paid to another goal of the act : improving patient safety . Each year tens of thousands of people die , and hundreds of thousands more are injured , as a result of medical error .Experts agree that the best way to reduce medical error is to gather and analyze information about past errors with an eye toward improving future care . But many believe that a major barrier to doing so is the medical malpractice tort system : the threat of being sued is believed to prevent the kind of transparency necessary to identify and learn from errors when they occur .New evidence , however , contradicts the conventional wisdom that malpractice litigation compromises the patient safety movementâs call for transparency . In fact , the opposite appears to be occurring : the openness and transparency promoted by patient safety advocates appear to be influencing hospitalsâ responses to litigation risk .I recently surveyed more than 400 people responsible for hospital risk management , claims management and quality improvement in health care centers around the country , in cooperation with the American Society of Health Care Risk Managers , and I interviewed dozens more .My interviewees confirmed that while hospitals historically took an adversarial and secretive approach to lawsuits and error , that has begun to change . In recent years , hospitals have become increasingly open with patients : over 80 percent of hospitals in my study have a policy of apologizing to patients when errors occur . And hospitals are more willing to discuss and learn from errors with hospital staff .What accounts for these changes ? Several factors appear to have overcome historical resistance to transparency , including widespread laws requiring disclosure to patients and confidentiality protections for internal discussions of error . Hospitals have also found that disclosing errors to patients and offering early settlements reduces the costs and frequency of litigation .My study also shows that malpractice suits are playing an unexpected role in patient safety efforts , as a source of valuable information about medical error . Over 95 percent of the hospitals in my study integrate information from lawsuits into patient safety efforts . And risk managers and patient-safety personnel overwhelmingly report that lawsuit data have proved useful in efforts to identify and address error .One might think that hospitals would have little to learn from lawsuits , given other requirements that hospitals report , investigate and analyze medical error . But participants in my study said that lawsuits can reveal previously unknown incidents of medical errors â particularly diagnostic and treatment errors with delayed manifestations that other reporting systems are not designed to collect .Lawsuits can also reveal errors that should have been reported but were not â medical providers notoriously underreport errors ( although studies have shown that the threat of litigation is not responsible for this underreporting ) and lawsuits may fill these gaps .Moreover , litigation discovery can unearth useful details about safety and quality concerns . Analyses of claim trends can reveal problematic procedures and departments , and closed litigation files can serve as rich teaching tools .True , malpractice litigation data also have many flaws : too few malpractice claims are filed to reflect an accurate picture of a hospitalâs shortcomings , and the amount awarded in litigation may not reflect the merits of the claims . Yet hospitals say they recognize and account for these flaws in their review .The assumed negative effects of malpractice litigation on patient safety have been used to justify numerous proposals for reform , including damages caps and âhealth courts , â administrative bodies that adjudicate malpractice claims outside the tort system . Politicians , patient safety advocates and medical providers argue that such reforms will encourage more open discussions of medical error by removing the specter of liability .My study suggests , however , that hospitals can â and have â found ways to increase openness and transparency without these dramatic interventions . Moreover , because lawsuits help to identify incidents and details of medical error , limitations on lawsuits may actually impede patient safety efforts .The Affordable Care Act pours millions into patient safety for research centers , demonstration projects and other programs . Proposed reforms and initiatives should not rely on conventional wisdom about the negative effects of malpractice litigation . Medical-malpractice lawsuits do not have the harmful effects on patient safety that they are imagined to have â and , in fact , they can do some good .

AtlantaWE know that too many Americans can’t afford primary care and end up in the emergency room with asthma or heart failure . But in the debate over health care coverage , less attention has been paid to the fact that too many Americans also end up in the emergency room with severe tooth abscesses that keep them from eating or infections that can travel from decayed teeth to the brain and , if untreated , kill .More than 830,000 visits to emergency rooms nationwide in 2009 were for preventable dental problems . In my state of Georgia , visits to the E.R . for oral health problems cost more than $ 23 million in 2007 . According to more recent data from Florida , the bill exceeded $ 88 million . And dental disease is the No . 1 chronic childhood disease , sending more children in search of medical treatment than asthma . In a nation obsessed with high-tech medicine , people are not getting preventive care for something as simple as tooth decay .It’s easy to understand why . Close to 50 million Americans live in rural or poor areas where dentists do not practice . Most dentists do not accept Medicaid patients . And the shortage of dentists is going to get only worse : by 2014 , under the Affordable Care Act , 5.3 million more children will be entitled to dental benefits from Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program . Little is being done — by the dental profession or by the federal or state governments — to prepare for it .During the physician shortage of the middle of the last century , the federal government began creating about 50 new medical schools , doubling the number of graduating doctors . Today our government can and should train more dentists to address the long-term problem . But there is no guarantee that the new recruits would practice in underserved areas , and we need practitioners now .A more immediate solution is to train dental therapists who can provide preventive care and routine procedures like sealants , fillings and simple extractions outside the confines of a traditional dentist’s office . Dental therapists are common worldwide , and yet in the United States they practice only in Alaska and Minnesota , where state law allows it . Legislation is pending in five more states .The dental profession has resisted efforts to allow midlevel providers to deliver this kind of care , and the government has so far failed to push for the change . It must do so now . The federal government could encourage states to pass laws allowing these providers to practice by calling for demonstration projects proving their worth .The best model for how this system can work is found in remote Alaska Native villages , many accessible only by plane , snowmobile or dogsled , where high school seniors once graduated with full sets of dentures . Unable to recruit dentists to these areas , Alaska has been training its own dental therapists .When Alaska began the project in 2003 , there were no training programs in the country , so the state first sent students to New Zealand , which had a rigorous training program for dental therapists . These therapists now travel to small clinics and schools , often carrying their equipment with them . They consult with a supervising dentist from the region but do most procedures themselves . Many were raised in the communities in which they now work , so they understand the culture , children trust them and they have quickly become local health care leaders . Thanks to the program , around 35,000 people now live in communities where there is regular access to dental care .We have two years to prepare before millions of children will be entitled to access to dental care , and Alaska shows us the way forward . Access means more than having an insurance card ; it means having professionals available to provide care . Public officials should foster the creation of these midlevel providers — and dentists should embrace the opportunity to broaden the profession so they can expand services to those in need .

LEXINGTON , Ky. – Political campaigns aren’t generally associated with specificity or truth-telling and political debates are no different . But at Monday night’s debate in Lexington , both Senator Mitch McConnell and his Democratic challenger , Alison Lundergan Grimes , the Kentucky Secretary of State , reached absurd heights in the art of weasel-wording .Ms. Grimes knew the question was coming , since she’s fielded it several times in the last few days . The host of the debate , Bill Goodman , asked Ms. Grimes for whom she’d voted in the 2012 presidential election . I’ll take a wild guess here that Ms. Grimes , a Democrat who was a member of the Kentucky delegation to the Democratic National Convention two years ago , went for the Democrat : Barack Obama . But she refused to say — because she’s petrified of being linked with the president , who is deeply unpopular in Kentucky . Instead , she took umbrage on the grounds that the Kentucky constitution guarantees ballot box secrecy . She actually made the preposterous claim that by ducking the question she was standing on constitutional principle .Mr. McConnell then made her look foolish by freely sharing his votes in the 2008 and 2012 presidential contests , as well as in the 2010 Senate race , when he voted for Trey Grayson , who lost to Rand Paul , the Tea Party darling .Mr. McConnell , who’s been in Washington long enough —30 years — to know how to speak without communicating any information , had plenty of opportunity to show off his considerable obfuscation skills .Is the minimum wage a living wage , Mr. Goodman asked Mr. McConnell . “It’s an entry-level wage , ” said Mr. McConnell , hardly an answer .Is climate change real ? Before he could plead that he was “not a scientist , ” Mr. Goodman pointed out that although the senator was not an economist , he was willing to share his opinions on the economy . In a tight spot , Mr. McConnell said : “There are a bunch of scientists who feel there is a problem and maybe we can do something about it.”Lest he be accused of siding with environmentalists , he added the caveat that scientists in the 1970s thought we were moving toward an ice age , and closed by declaring that his job , as United States Senator from Kentucky , was to fight for coal jobs in the state .Mr. McConnell approached Ms. Grimes’s “ballot box secrecy”-level of absurdity when Mr. Goodman asked him if “Obamacare and Kynect” had been “a boon or bane” for the state . The difficulty for Mr. McConnell is that the Affordable Care Act is politically toxic in Kentucky , while Kynect — which is the state’s health insurance program created under the Affordable Care Act — is a runaway success .Mr. McConnell’s attempt to separate the two made no sense . The Affordable Care Act should be “pulled out root and branch.” As for Kynect , that’s just “a website . It was paid for by a grant . The website can continue.”Seeking clarity , Mr. Goodman asked if Mr. McConnell would support the continuation of Kynect . “Yeah , I think it’s fine to have a website , yeah , ” said the senator .That’s like saying that Google should cease to exist but that Google.com should live on .
PHILADELPHIA — A FEW months ago , a patient came to our hospital , seeking help . One of us , Edward , was on the team that treated him . He was pleasant , if slightly withdrawn , and cogent . He was a college graduate in his 20s and had recently been fired from his job as a high school math teacher , because of unexpected absences . He had come to believe that government agents were conspiring against him , and he had taken to living out of a truck and sleeping in different parking lots . By the time he came to us , he was exhausted . A diagnosis became clear : he had schizophrenia .We admitted him to the hospital , and after a few days , with his symptoms under control , we released him . Unfortunately , we prescribed a medication for him that could cause significant , permanent harm , instead of an equally effective drug with milder side effects — all because he was uninsured .Schizophrenia , which affects 1 percent of the population and emerges in the late teens to early 20s , is deeply misunderstood . People who suffer from it are often suspected of being dangerous , but this is not usually the case , and antipsychotic drugs are very effective . Our patient was exactly the kind of person who , with the right treatment , could have weakened the stigma surrounding schizophrenia .Antipsychotic drugs fall into two classes : the older ones , like Haldol , and newer ones , like Abilify and Latuda . Both classes are equally effective at treating some of the worst symptoms of schizophrenia , specifically the hallucinations , delusions and paranoia that cause social alienation . ( They’re not effective for treating “negative symptoms , ” like low motivation . )But the older drugs can cause a multitude of serious side effects , including a potentially devastating one called tardive dyskinesia . This condition involves unsettling , animalistic smacking and wagging of the lips and tongue . At its extreme , it can affect the entire body . It occurs in 20 percent or more of patients who take the drugs long-term , and it tends to start so mildly that patients can’t identify it in time to stop taking the drugs . It is often irreversible .The newer drugs have lower rates of tardive dyskinesia ( estimates vary , but most likely less than half or one-third the risk ) , although they can cause weight gain and predisposition to diabetes , among other side effects . The newest among them , however , have decreased these risks , too . And a 2006 study showed that patients were more likely to keep taking the new drugs than the older ones .As a result , most psychiatrists prefer the newer drugs , especially for younger people , and they should have been the clear choice for our patient .He didn’t have the luxury of choice , however , because he was uninsured , and he was explicit about the fact that he didn’t have much money to spend on medications . So we had to prescribe him Haldol , which costs about $ 20 per month , instead of one of the newer drugs , which can cost more than $ 600 per month .Had our patient been lower functioning , he might have qualified for disability benefits and Medicaid , which would have covered the new drugs . Many people who are much more severely affected — homeless individuals who are floridly psychotic , for example — receive the newest and best of our antipsychotics . They spend more time in the hospital and get more intensive case management .Our patient was , in effect , penalized for being employable . People with schizophrenia are especially poorly suited for an employer-based health insurance system , because even if they are capable of working , their symptoms can lead to frequent job changes and firings . The Affordable Care Act should help , as it expands Medicaid to all people earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty line . Pennsylvania , however , has so far decided not to participate in the expansion .Some might argue that our treatment choice was an example of cost-effective medicine . New antipsychotics aren’t clearly more cost-effective than older ones , so why not save hundreds of dollars per month ? For our patient , though , it isn’t simply the difference between more or fewer symptoms . It’s potentially the difference between a life spent gainfully employed thanks to consistent treatment , and a life spent in and out of treatment and increasingly out of control , stopping and starting medication , and always under threat of a disfiguring side effect .A 2002 study showed that 70 percent of those with well-controlled schizophrenia still worried about being viewed unfavorably because of their illness . Better treatment for patients like ours is an important step in changing this . Hopefully he can become a model of how well those with schizophrenia can integrate into society . But if he ends up getting tardive dyskinesia , he may be alienated even further .These issues will be amplified as progress is made in discovering the mechanisms of psychiatric disease , as it likely will be , thanks to the billions of dollars that are now going to neuroscience research . We can already see the results of that kind of investment in oncology , where extravagantly expensive specialty drugs are coming on the market . But as we make much-needed progress and develop new , expensive treatments that are clearly superior to old , cheap ones , we have to ask : Will those with the most to gain still receive a lower standard of care ?
Hanover , N.H .BY 1990 , many doctors were recommending hormone replacement therapy to healthy middle-aged women and P.S.A . screening for prostate cancer to older men . Both interventions had become standard medical practice .But in 2002 , a randomized trial showed that preventive hormone replacement caused more problems ( more heart disease and breast cancer ) than it solved ( fewer hip fractures and colon cancer ) . Then , in 2009 , trials showed that P.S.A . screening led to many unnecessary surgeries and had a dubious effect on prostate cancer deaths .How would you have felt — after over a decade of following your doctor’s advice — to learn that high-quality randomized trials of these standard practices had only just been completed ? And that they showed that both did more harm than good ? Justifiably furious , I’d say . Because these practices affected millions of Americans , they are locked in a tight competition for the greatest medical error on record .The problem goes far beyond these two . The truth is that for a large part of medical practice , we don’t know what works . But we pay for it anyway . Our annual per capita health care expenditure is now over $ 8,000 . Many countries pay half that — and enjoy similar , often better , outcomes . Isn’t it time to learn which practices , in fact , improve our health , and which ones don’t ?To find out , we need more medical research . But not just any kind of medical research . Medical research is dominated by research on the new : new tests , new treatments , new disorders and new fads . But above all , it’s about new markets .We don’t need to find more things to spend money on ; we need to figure out what’s being done now that is not working . That’s why we have to start directing more money toward evaluating standard practices — all the tests and treatments that doctors are already providing .There are many places to start . Mammograms are increasingly finding a microscopic abnormality called D.C.I.S. , or ductal carcinoma in situ . Currently we treat it as if it were invasive breast cancer , with surgery , radiation and chemotherapy . Some doctors think this is necessary , others don’t . The question is relevant to more than 60,000 women each year . Don’t you think we should know the answer ?Or how about this one : How should we screen for colon cancer ? The standard approach , fecal occult blood testing , is simple and cheap . But more and more Americans are opting for colonoscopy — over four million per year in Medicare alone . It’s neither simple nor cheap . In terms of the technology and personnel involved , it’s more like going to the operating room . ( I know , I’ve had one . ) Which is better ? We don’t know .Let me be clear , answering questions like these is not easy . The Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies Program is in fact preparing to take on the colonoscopy versus fecal occult blood testing question . The trial , which will involve up to 50,000 patients , will last a decade and surely cost millions of dollars .Research like this takes more than grant money . For starters , it takes a research infrastructure that monitors what standard practice is — data on what’s actually happening across the country . Because of Medicare , we have a clear view for patients age 65 and older , but it’s a lot cloudier for those under 65 . Basic questions like how common annual physical exams are and what testing is part of them are unanswerable .It also takes a research culture that promotes a healthy skepticism toward standard medical practice . That requires physician researchers who know what standard practice is , have the imagination to question it and the skills to study it . These doctors need training that’s not yet part of any medical school curriculum ; they need mentoring of senior researchers ; and they need some assurance that investigating accepted treatments can be a viable option , instead of career suicide .We have to move quickly . The administrative demands of clinical care , on one side , and the competition for research funding on the other , make it increasingly difficult for researchers to see patients . They become isolated from standard practice , and their ability to study it diminishes . Clinicians who are well positioned to study these issues are increasingly directed toward enhancing productivity — questions about how can we do this better , faster or more consistently — instead of questions about whether the practices are warranted in the first place .Here’s a simple idea to turn this around : devote 1 percent of health care expenditures to evaluating what the other 99 percent is buying . Distribute the research dollars to match the clinical dollars . Figure out what works and what doesn’t . The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute ( created as part of the Affordable Care Act to study the comparative effectiveness of different treatments ) is supposed to tackle questions of direct relevance to patients and could take on this role , but its budget — less than 0.03 percent of total spending — is far from sufficient .A call for more medical research might sound like pablum . Worse , coming from a medical researcher , it might sound like self-interest ( cut me some slack , that’s another one of our standard practices ) . But I don’t need the money . The system does . Or if you prefer , we can continue to argue about who pays for what — without knowing what’s worth paying for .
Cambridge , Mass .OF the many momentous issues the Supreme Court will take up this term , few are as volatile as same-sex marriage . In the term that began last week , the justices are expected to consider the constitutionality of the federal Defense of Marriage Act , and possibly state bans on gay marriage as well . The question looms : how might they rule ?The Defense of Marriage Act , or DOMA , the 1996 law denying federal recognition to same-sex marriages lawfully performed by states , is probably the easier case for the justices . Historically , Congress has deferred to state definitions of marriage , and several federal courts have invalidated the law on these grounds of federalism . DOMA is also vulnerable because some of its legislative sponsors defended it in blatantly homophobic terms . Polls show that a substantial majority of Americans are opposed to it . Conservative justices who value federalism and liberal justices who sympathize with gay marriage will probably combine to invalidate the act .Predicting how the justices might rule on state bans on same-sex marriage is harder , as the relevant legal doctrine — which flows from judicial precedent , textual interpretation , and social norms and traditions — is varied enough that plausible arguments can be made on both sides .On one hand , some judges — notably Justice Antonin Scalia — think the constitutional case for same-sex marriage obviously fails because nobody in 1868 , when the 14th Amendment was ratified , dreamed that its equal protection clause applied to gay marriage . The right to marriage , which is deeply rooted in American history , was traditionally limited to opposite-sex couples . And there is no Supreme Court precedent subjecting laws that classify based on sexual orientation to the rigorous judicial scrutiny that has been applied to classifications based on race or sex .On the other hand , some judges have ruled that classifications based on sexual orientation should receive such scrutiny , as gay men and lesbians have long been victims of discrimination and still face social and political obstacles . They have also argued that marriage is a fundamental right that should not be narrowly circumscribed without good reason , and have found wanting the argument that marriage bears an inherent link to procreation .If constitutional doctrine will not determine the outcome of a Supreme Court case on gay marriage , what will ? Politics .Today’s justices divide five to four on virtually every important contemporary constitutional issue , including abortion , affirmative action , campaign finance , capital punishment and gun control . The court consists of two relatively stable four-person blocs of liberals and conservatives , with Anthony M. Kennedy hovering between them , usually casting the deciding vote . He has sided with the liberals in some cases involving abortion , the death penalty , and other civil liberties issues , but with the conservatives in most other cases . Gay marriage is likely to turn on Justice Kennedy’s vote . What might it be ?Justice Kennedy could , of course , follow a compromise path and rule that the Constitution mandates at least civil unions for same-sex couples . With two-thirds of Americans supporting civil unions , such a ruling would generate little political controversy .But were Justice Kennedy to rule on gay marriage itself , his decision would most likely depend on how he balanced two competing tendencies . As in decisions invalidating state sodomy laws and barring the death penalty for minors and the mentally disabled , Justice Kennedy’s rulings often bolster dominant national norms and suppress dissident state practices . This approach would counsel restraint at a time when only six states and the District of Columbia permit gay marriage . ( On Election Day , same-sex marriage will be on the ballot in Maine , Maryland and Washington , and a constitutional amendment to ban it will be on the ballot in Minnesota . )However , Justice Kennedy also explicitly embraces the idea of the Constitution as a living document whose meaning reflects evolving social mores . Partly on this basis , he wrote both of the court’s pro-gay-rights decisions : the 1996 opinion in Romer v. Evans , which invalidated a provision in the Colorado Constitution barring state or local governments from enacting laws forbidding discrimination based on sexual orientation , and the 2003 opinion in Lawrence v. Texas , which ruled that sodomy laws violated the due process clause of the 14th Amendment . It’s also notable that Justice Kennedy treats international norms as relevant to American constitutional interpretation . Gay marriage has recently been legalized in South Africa , Canada and many European nations , and is being actively debated in others .Justice Kennedy’s opinions often suggest that he wants to be on the right side of history , which matters greatly here because the future of gay marriage in America is so clear . Support has increased from less than 25 percent in 1990 to roughly 35 percent in 2004 to over 50 percent today . At the current rate , a substantial majority of Americans will support gay marriage within the next dozen years .A Supreme Court ruling in favor of gay marriage would divide the nation roughly down the middle , much as the Court’s ruling against racial segregation , in Brown v. Board of Education , did in 1954 . Yet , within two decades , the Brown decision was almost universally revered . A decision protecting same-sex marriage would probably also soon become historic . Indeed , some lower courts have already recognized the significance of pro-gay-marriage rulings . The author of Massachusetts’s pioneering gay marriage ruling compared it to that court’s prohibition of slavery in the 1780s . In 2008 , the California Supreme Court struck down a ban on same-sex marriage , proudly invoking its 1948 decision that invalidated a ban on interracial marriage . ( The California ruling was subsequently superseded by Proposition 8 , a voter initiative that amended the State Constitution to ban same-sex marriage . )Of course , predicting how Supreme Court justices will vote in particular cases is risky business . Who could possibly have forecast the convoluted path that Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. took to uphold the Affordable Care Act , President Obama’s signature health care legislation , last term ? But on the whole , it seems likely that when the case arises , Justice Kennedy will be tempted to write an opinion that would quickly become the Brown v. Board of the gay rights movement .
ANDY INKSTER , a transgender man , had always wanted biological children . So when he embarked on the transition from female to male at age 18 — changing his name , taking testosterone and eventually undergoing surgery to remove his breasts — he left his female reproductive organs intact .In his mid-20s , he decided it was time . He stopped taking testosterone and started trying to get pregnant . Eventually , in 2009 , after beginning graduate school at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst , he sought fertility treatment at Baystate Reproductive Medicine . Baystate was one of the few clinics in the country with an anti-discrimination policy for gender identity . And yet , it refused to treat him , arguing that it didn’t have enough expertise to treat transgender patients . Mr. Inkster insisted there was no medical reason to deny him ; his baby-making parts were the same as any woman’s .The more than 700,000 transgender people living in the United States have long faced discrimination by health care providers . Over the past 15 years , activists have fought to compel insurers to cover transgender-related health care — from hormone therapy to gender reassignment surgery — or at least be prevented from excluding transgender clients from buying policies for basic services . Finally , starting this month , thanks to the Affordable Care Act , “transsexualism” can no longer be considered a pre-existing condition . What’s been left out of the spotlight : having babies . Many Americans have come to accept gay parents ; the transgender community is next in line for recognition .Mr. Inkster eventually found another clinic that helped him conceive via in vitro fertilization and donor sperm , and in October 2010 , he gave birth to a daughter , Elise . A month later , he sued Baystate for sexual discrimination .According to court documents , he was denied treatment after failing to comply with a clinic counselor’s request that he supply information from his current therapist that he was emotionally ready to handle pregnancy and parenting . Mr. Inkster argued that nontransgender patients weren’t asked to do the same . This fall , the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination — the state’s civil rights agency — found probable cause for Mr. Inkster . The case will next move on to a conciliation conference , and then to a possible settlement .Admittedly , the idea of a “pregnant man” makes many people uncomfortable , and photos of Mr. Inkster caressing his bulging belly are startling . The issue is controversial even within the transgender community . “Some people believe if you’re a trans man you shouldn’t be wanting to bear kids , ” Jamison Green , the author of “Becoming a Visible Man , ” told me . “That’s not something men do . Others think , If you have a body part that does something , why can’t you use it ? It’s your body.”The issue brings up unprecedented questions : Do you use your genetic material to reproduce , and at what time during your transition ? Before or after hormone therapy ? Before undergoing reassignment surgery that will make you sterile ? Should a transgender man like Mr. Inkster keep his breasts so he can nurse later ? Is it generally psychologically healthier for someone like him to freeze his eggs and have them inseminated and the embryos transferred to a female partner or surrogate , rather than leave his female reproductive parts intact ? How might years of estrogen or testosterone therapy affect eggs and sperm ?These questions matter . One study published last year in the journal Human Reproduction of 90 transgender men in Belgium found that 54 percent wished to have children , and 38 percent would have considered freezing their eggs if the procedure had been available . Other research , published in 2002 , by Belgian fertility doctors with Western European transgender women found that 40 percent wanted to have children , and 77 percent felt they should have the option to preserve their sperm before hormone treatment . As fertility technology improves and becomes more widely available , transgender people are realizing that they will have more options in the future .Jennifer Hastings , a family care physician based in Santa Cruz , Calif. , who specializes in transgender health care , says it’s tricky to balance gender identity with family desires . “We have preteens who come in and say , ‘I don’t want to be a mom . I want to be a dad ! ’ ” she says . “On the other hand , there are youth who know they want to have biological kids from the outset and freeze sperm or eggs after going through puberty.” Since some doctors are concerned that letting transgender teenagers go through puberty in the gender they don’t identify with may be deeply traumatic , they might administer puberty-blocking medications that delay adolescence until the teenagers can begin hormone therapy in their desired gender . But this means the patients may give up the option of having biological children later . “It can be a painful choice for their parents to make , ” says Dr. Hastings .All these paths toward creating transgender families deserve careful study . Yet these issues aren’t likely to get the attention they deserve until transgender people succeed in getting basic health care first .Stories of transgender people in health care settings being gawked at , mocked or interrogated about their status abound . A disturbing 2011 study by the National Center for Transgender Equality and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force of 6,450 transgender adults found that 19 percent reported having been refused treatment by a health care provider because of their gender identity , and 28 percent said they had postponed medical care because of discrimination . For those who had visited a doctor’s office or hospital , 24 percent said they had been denied equal treatment , 25 percent reported having been harassed or disrespected , and 2 percent had been physically assaulted .It’s understandable that doctors might be nervous about not having enough training to treat people who are under long-term hormone therapy . Medical schools need to make students more aware of transgender health needs , which in most cases aren’t that different from everyone else’s . “If someone has a sore throat , they have a sore throat , ” said Dr. Hastings . “It’s not because of their hormones.”The bigger challenge may be to get medical providers to overcome their bias . Discomfort over difference isn’t an excuse to refuse compassionate care to a transgender person in an emergency room or a fertility clinic , or for insurance companies to refuse to cover that care . Gender identity has nothing to do with the desire to have children — or with who will make a good parent .
WashingtonDESPITE high unemployment , there is one bright spot in the economy : while nearly all other sectors shrank during the recession , jobs in health care increased by more than 1.2 million , with most paying salaries of over $ 60,000 . And demand for those workers will keep improving : the Affordable Care Act will add 32 million people to insurance rolls over the next several years , while the aging of America will drive the need for health care for decades to come .But for American health workers , this is hardly good news . Despite a labor shortage , our crowded medical professional schools are turning away hundreds of thousands of qualified applicants ; to fill the gap , we are importing tens of thousands of foreign workers . Today about 12 percent of the health work force is foreign-born and trained , including a quarter of all physicians .Thatâs bad for American workers , but even worse for the foreign workersâ home countries , including some of the worldâs poorest and sickest , which could use these professionals at home .The blame lies primarily with the woeful state of schools in the health professions . Despite increased demand for their graduates , they have done little to expand their output .Even worse , although the cost of higher education increased faster than inflation for the past two decades , the per graduate cost of health professional education has increased even faster : over the past 20 years , public medical school tuitions have increased 312 percent .State regulators also artificially limit the number of health professionals we can train by effectively requiring that students be trained almost exclusively in teaching hospitals , even though most go on to work in clinics or community hospitals . Not only does this limit the number of people who can be educated , but the resulting increases in tuition and length of training reduce the number of students from poor and underserved communities who apply to health professional schools in the first place .Then thereâs the phenomenon of credential creep : in fields like audiology , physical therapy and optometry , a therapist who once needed a masterâs degree must now have a doctorate to get a license , which means more years of school , higher attrition rates , higher debt , higher wage demands and fewer workers from underserved and low-income areas . The same licensing system actually favors foreign-trained health workers , who , for various reasons , do not have to meet these degree requirements .Itâs no surprise , then , that the response to this self-made labor shortage has been to recruit inexpensive workers from abroad , including the 57 poor countries defined by the World Health Organization as having significant shortages of their own . Among them is India , Americaâs largest source of foreign-trained doctors . A special visa program has made hiring these workers even easier .A Gates Foundation study recently showed that immigration , with the United States as the most common destination , was siphoning off the largest number of African medical professionals .The Global Health Workforce Alliance estimates that a billion people alive today will die without ever seeing a health care worker . Meanwhile , the W.H.O . estimates that below a threshold of 2.3 doctors , nurses and midwives per 1,000 people , countries are unable to provide even the most basic health services .Multiple studies , even when controlled for poverty , show that access to health workers is directly related to mortality and health outcomes . A meta-analysis of 13 studies of developing countries showed that newborns who live more than three miles from a staffed health facility are almost twice as likely to die than infants who live closer to one . Health workers in developing countries donât just provide clinical care â they also manage their countriesâ health and disaster response systems , as well as nutrition and sanitation programs , all of which crumble in their absence .There are other casualties , closer to home . Every study that has examined how to incentivize health workers to move to underserved areas has shown that training people from these communities is the most cost-effective approach . But because weâve essentially given up on recruiting from underserved places in the United States , weâve made their chronic lack of health workers much worse . Some 54 million people live in the 5,700 parts of the country defined as âhealth professional shortage areas , â the communities with the worst health statistics and the worst unemployment .In response , schools should be required to pay attention to cost effectiveness and train more workers with their existing budgets . Federal money could go toward helping these schools expand .Meanwhile , the Departments of Education and Health and Human Services , which essentially let the health professions regulate their schools , could mandate that all new licensing requirements be justified with cost-effectiveness data ; they could also require schools to communicate with employers to gauge the numbers and skills of workers needed .It is irrational and immoral to recruit health workers from countries where one in five children die before their fifth birthday when we could be recruiting and training workers domestically . Doing so would help our economy , global public health and the 314 million Americans who rely on our medical system to provide high-quality , affordable care .
I actually agree with a lot of what David Brooks says today . But — you know there has to be a “but” — so does a guy named Barack Obama . Which brings me to one of the enduringly weird aspects of our current pundit discourse : constant calls for a moderate , sensible path that supposedly lies between the extremes of the two parties , but is in fact exactly what Obama has been proposing .So , David says thatThe federal government should borrow money at current interest rates to build infrastructure , including better bus networks so workers can get to distant jobs . The fact that the federal government has not passed major infrastructure legislation is mind-boggling , considering how much support there is from both parties .Well , the Obama administration would love to spend more on infrastructure ; the problem is that a major spending bill has no chance of passing the House . And that’s not a problem of “both parties” — it’s the GOP blocking it . Exactly how many Republicans would be willing to engage in deficit spending to expand bus networks ? ( Remember , these are the people who consider making rental bicycles available an example of “totalitarian” rule . )Also , there’s this:the government should reduce its generosity to people who are not working but increase its support for people who are . That means reducing health benefits for the affluent elderly …Hmm . The Affordable Care Act subsidizes insurance premiums for lower-income workers , and pays for those subsidies in part by eliminating overpayments for Medicare Advantage . So conservatives are celebrating both ends of that deal , right ? Oh , wait , death panels .It’s an amazing thing : Obama is essentially what we used to call a liberal Republican , who faces implacable opposition from a very hard right . But Obama’s moderation is hidden in plain sight , apparently invisible to the commentariat .
Senator Mitch McConnell said yesterday that he would not shut down the government , over immigration or anything else , after he takes over as Majority Leader in January . On the same day , Speaker John Boehner refused to rule out a shutdown . Both were being deceptive , but Mr. McConnell , as usual , was a little more clever about it .The House produced last year’s government shutdown when it insisted on attaching the repeal of various parts of the Affordable Care Act to spending bills necessary to keep the government open . That was a huge embarrassment for Mr. Boehner , making his caucus appear feral and ungovernable , and he has no desire to repeat it . But his newly expanded Republican majority actually is a bit wilder than the outgoing one , and it is inflamed by President Obama’s plans to take executive action on immigration by sparing up to 5 million people from deportation . Some on the far right want to pass no spending bills if the president takes action ; others , as National Review reported , want to shut down only specific departments , like Homeland Security ( which includes Immigration and Customs Enforcement ) .Mr. Boehner is playing his customary game of appearing provocative in public , to keep his most extreme members at bay , while trying to cut some kind of deal in private . But if he or his members think a shutdown of the Homeland Security department is going to work , they’re kidding themselves . During the last shutdown , most of the department stayed open , in part because many of its functions are considered essential and are funded by fees rather than Congressional appropriations . To have any real leverage , House Republicans would have to threaten to shut down more than that .Mr. McConnell wants his chamber to appear reasonable and governable in contrast to the House , and likes to portray himself as the leader who averts shutdowns . But he’s the one who has already threatened to use spending bills to stop any environmental regulations that might restrict the burning of coal , which is the same as a shutdown threat .His plans are evident in the exact wording of his statement yesterday : “We’ll not be shutting the government down or threatening to default on the national debt.” But if he can pin the shutdown on the president , then he can claim he wasn’t the one who closed the government’s doors . During the last shutdown , the spending bills never reached the president’s desk for a veto , because the House’s demands were rejected by the Senate , and everything was blamed on “Congressional gridlock.” With Republican control of both chambers , things will be different , and a shutdown remains very much on the table .
Dr. Ben Carson , the retired neurosurgeon famous for saying the Affordable Care Act was “the worst thing that happened in this nation since slavery , ” is thinking about running for president in 2016 . But he’s not actually sure that an election will take place .Via Fox NewsChris Wallace : You are thinking about running for president in 2016 . And I want to talk to you about that in a moment , but it has brought attention back to some of your comments as it does to any candidate potentially running for president . You said recently that you thought that there might not actually be elections in 2016 because of widespread anarchy . Do you really believe that ? Ben Carson : Well , I hope that that’s not going to be the case , but certainly there is the potential . Because you have to recognize that we have a rapidly increasing national debt . A very unstable financial foundation . And you have all these things going on like the ISIS crisis that could very rapidly change things that are going on in our nation . And unless we begin to deal with these things in a comprehensive way , and in a logical way , there is no telling what could happen in just a matter of a couple of years . And particularly in a situation where we have a Senate and a Senate leader who has over 300 bills sitting on his desk will not bring them to the floor for a vote , thereby thwarting the will of the people . And this country was supposed to be a country where the government conformed to the will of the people , not the people conform to the will of the government .
BostonTHE drastic rise in the price of oil and gasolineÂ is in part the result of forces beyond our control : as high-growth countries like China and India increase the demand for petroleum , the price will go up .But there are factors contributing to the high price of oil that we can do something about . Chief among them is the effect of âpureâ speculators â investors who buy and sell oil futures but never take physical possession of actual barrels of oil . These middlemen add little value and lots of cost as they bid up the price of oil in pursuit of financial gain . They should be banned from the worldâs commodity exchanges , which could drive down the price of oil by as much as 40 percent and the price of gasoline by as much as $ 1 a gallon .Today , speculators dominate the trading of oil futures . According to Congressional testimony by the commodities specialist Michael W. Masters in 2009 , the oil futures markets routinely trade more than one billion barrels of oil per day . Given that the entire world produces only around 85 million actual âwetâ barrels a day , this means that more than 90 percent of trading involves speculatorsâ exchanging âpaperâ barrels with one another .Because of speculation , todayâs oil prices of about $ 100 a barrel have become disconnected from the costs of extraction , which average $ 11 a barrel worldwide . Pure speculators account for as much as 40 percent of that high price , according to testimony that Rex Tillerson , the chief executive of ExxonMobil , gave to Congress last year . That estimate is bolstered by a recent report from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis .Many economists contend that speculation on oil futures is a good thing , because it increases liquidity and better distributes risk , allowing refiners , producers , wholesalers and consumers ( like airlines ) to âhedgeâ their positions more efficiently , protecting themselves against unseen future shifts in the price of oil .But itâs one thing to have a trading system in which oil industry players place strategic bets on where prices will be months into the future ; itâs another thing to have a system in which hedge funds and bankers pump billions of purely speculative dollars into commodity exchanges , chasing a limited number of barrels and driving up the price . The same concern explains why the United States government placed limits on pure speculators in grain exchanges after repeated manipulations of crop prices during the Great Depression .The market for oil futures differs from the markets for other commodities in the sheer size and scope of trading and in the impact it has on a strategically important resource . There is a fundamental difference between oil futures and , say , orange juice futures . If orange juice gets too pricey ( perhaps because of a speculative bubble ) , we can easily switch to apple juice . The same does not hold with oil . Higher oil prices act like a choke-chain on the economy , dragging down profits for ordinary businesses and depressing investment .When I started buying and selling oil more than 30 years ago for my nonprofit organization , speculation wasnât a significant aspect of the industry . But in 1991 , just a few years after oil futures began trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange , Goldman Sachs made an argument to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission that Wall Street dealers who put down big bets on oil should be considered legitimate hedgersÂ and granted an exemption from regulatory limits on their trades .The commission granted an exemption that ultimately allowed Goldman Sachs to process billions of dollars in speculative oil trades . Other exemptions followed . By 2008 , eight investment banks accounted for 32 percent of the total oil futures market . According to a recent analysis by McClatchy , only about 30 percent of oil futures traders are actual oil industry participants .Congress was jolted into action when it learned of the full extent of Commodity Futures Trading Commissionâs lax oversight . In the wake of the economic crisis , the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law required greater trading transparency and limited speculators who lacked a legitimate business-hedging purpose to positions of no greater than 25 percent of the futures market.ÂThis is an important step , but limiting speculators in the oil markets doesnât go far enough . Even with the restrictions currently in place , those eight investment banks alone can severely inflate the price of oil.Â Federal legislation should bar pure oil speculators entirely from commodity exchanges in the United States . And the United States should use its clout to get European and Asian markets to follow its lead , chasing oil speculators from the worldâs commodity markets .Eliminating pure speculation on oil futures is a question of fairness.Â The choice is between a world of hedge-fund traders who make enormous amounts of money at the expense of people who need to drive their cars and heat their homes , and a world where the fundamentals of life â food , housing , health care , education and energy â remain affordable for all .
NOW that President Obama has granted legal relief to as many as five million undocumented immigrants , Republicans are thrashing about for an effective response . Only a few hard-liners are talking about impeachment now , but more could join them out of frustration with their other options .Many people in both parties have tried to quell such talk by saying the president is within his powers to issue the order . The problem is , the pro-impeachment Republicans are right : There is a plausible case for taking that step .By constitutional design , impeachment for “treason , bribery , or other high crimes and misdemeanors” is a political accusation and initiates a political remedy , not a legal one . It is pretty much up to Congress to define and apply “high crimes and misdemeanors , ” and no court would second-guess it . The next Congress could find that the president had violated his oath to “faithfully execute” the laws by refusing to enforce important provisions of the Affordable Care Act , No Child Left Behind and , now , the Immigration and Nationality Act .The president surely has some power to withhold prosecution , but granting legal status and work permits to millions of people most likely exceeds his discretion . No judge can decide the precise scope of his discretion because no one , including Congress , has legal standing to challenge his order in court .Of course , many lawyers at the Justice Department and elsewhere disagree , noting that prosecutorial discretion is pervasive , that there isn’t enough money to prosecute all violators , that the president will continue to prosecute criminals and illegal border crossers , and that earlier presidents have done the same thing . These are serious arguments . But as an immigration and administrative law teacher who strongly favors more legal immigration and even broader legislative relief than Mr. Obama’s order grants ( and who voted for him twice ) , I find them unconvincing .In the Immigration and Nationality Act , Congress carefully limited prosecutorial discretion by allowing the president to waive exclusions and deportations only under narrowly defined conditions . The act also granted the president broad power to suspend the entry of “any class of aliens” he finds detrimental to the national interest — but , significantly , did not give him corresponding authority to legalize “any class” of undocumented people he thinks deserve it .President Obama has cited several cases of suspended enforcement as precedent . But in those cases , Congress had authorized the immigrants in question to apply for green cards ; the president merely suspended enforcement against their closest family members until they , too , could get their own cards .Most telling , Mr. Obama , a former constitutional law professor , once rejected the very arguments he now embraces . Last year he said that extending amnesty beyond the so-called Dreamers ( the children of undocumented immigrants brought here at an early age ) would be “ignoring the law in a way that I think would be very difficult to defend legally.” It is hard to think of a confession more damning to his position in a court of law , in a congressional court of impeachment and in the court of public opinion .Still , does his overreaching constitute an “impeachable offense” under the constitutional standard ? History suggests that it might . In the early 1800s , two federal judges were impeached for far less : noncriminal intoxication , indecency , bias and other judicial improprieties .True , the standard for impeaching presidents should be more demanding than for judges . Even so , in 1868 President Andrew Johnson was impeached by a deeply partisan , Radical Republican-dominated House . Johnson — a conservative Democrat who rose from the vice presidency when Abraham Lincoln , a Republican , was assassinated — was impeached mainly for firing a cabinet member ( which he almost certainly had the legal right to do ) , but also for obstructing policies that Congress enacted . ( Impeachment proceedings against Richard M. Nixon and Bill Clinton involved criminal conduct more egregious than Mr. Obama’s policy unilateralism . )But even if Congress has constitutional authority to impeach the president , that doesn’t mean it should . Quarrels between a president and Congress over the statutory limits on his authority are common , and the precise boundaries can be hard to discern . However truculent Mr. Obama’s defiance may be on this issue , Congress has other ways to stymie it — for example , barring the action by statute . Such tactics are within the normal give-and-take of interbranch disputes . Americans , including many like me who want a legislative amnesty , would support Congress’s use of them here .Impeachment , moreover , would tend to normalize its use as a political weapon , even though the framers intended that it be used only in extreme cases that endanger the republic . Only inveterate Obama haters think that is true here .The new Congress would accomplish nothing of consequence despite urgent national needs and voters’ demands for cooperation . This would deepen the public’s growing disgust with our government , a disgust that , properly directed , can spur needed reform , but if taken too far erodes the government’s capacity to do what only government can and must do . Perhaps most dangerous , impeachment of an already lame-duck president would further disable him for the next two years from defending American security and interests in a remorselessly turbulent , perilous world . All Americans should fervently pray that it doesn’t come to that .
Chapel Hill , N.C. — Over the last few weeks it has become fashionable to ridicule this election as a jumble of debates that don’t resonate with the average American . The Washington Post deemed these midterms “kind of — with apologies to Seinfeld — an election about nothing , ” and many other journalists have echoed the comparison . The joke is an old one : “as the reigning cliché had it , 2002 was the ‘Seinfeld’ election — an election about nothing , ” Frank Rich wrote in these pages 12 years ago .To say that an election is “about nothing” means that no coherent national narrative has emerged — other than the media’s obsession with the tight race for control of the Senate . Pundits and pollsters have published reams of charts predicting the final tally , but this obsession with data has further fragmented the story rather than explained what a Republican takeover would mean . Journalists have said comparatively little about what the party might do if it wins .In my state of North Carolina , the neck-and-neck contest between the Democratic senator Kay Hagan and the Republican Thom Tillis , speaker of the state House , seems to turn on one question . Who has provoked more voter outrage : the federal government or the state legislature ? But this notoriously ugly and expensive race may help explain what the 2014 midterm elections are really about . The answer is not “nothing.”Ms. Hagan ( and the “super PACs” that aid her ) have mainly aimed to mobilize women and minority voters , going so far as to accuse Mr. Tillis of leading “the effort to pass the kind of Stand Your Ground laws that caused the shooting death of Trayvon Martin.” Mr. Tillis’s supporters have done their share of fear-mongering among black voters too . “Does Kay Hagan care that one out of three babies aborted in America are black ? ” asks one radio spot . Mr. Tillis has mostly run against President Obama and the senator “who goes right along with him , ” in the words of one TV ad .But for North Carolinians the Senate race also serves as a referendum on the recent ideological revolution in the state : libertarians and social conservatives who gained control of both houses of the legislature in 2010 and the governor’s mansion in 2012 have obstructed access to abortion , blocked the advance of gay rights , cut taxes ( mainly for the wealthy ) and shrunk government investment in social services .On the left , this election is about identity politics : convincing particular groups , mainly women , African-Americans , and Latinos , that they are getting a raw deal , and that they should be angry . Don’t be fooled by the fact that so-called mainstream Republicans who want to stick tightly to the anti-Obama script have tried to sideline the most clamorous voices in the Tea Party and the Christian Right . On the right , this is a contest over ideology : will North Carolinians capitulate to secularism and socialist welfare spending , or will they stand strong on the principles of Christian “family values” and the free market ?Here in North Carolina , the silences speak louder than the noisy vitriol . Ms. Hagan — like most of her Democratic colleagues nationwide — has avoided speaking in ideological terms . Her vague references to “North Carolina values” do not offer a clear vision of the role of government in balancing equality with liberty , or personal autonomy with communal responsibility . Meanwhile , Republican supporters of Mr. Tillis have painstakingly avoided the identity politics at work in his base , where the preponderance of middle-aged white men is no secret .This election has affirmed a persistent truth of American politics over the last half century : The left can’t talk openly about ideology , while the right pretends to ignore its own identity politics . The country’s political conversation is boring and unsatisfying precisely because its unspoken rules forbid politicians from acknowledging what is really going on and encourage them to talk past one another .The right has so thoroughly captured the terms of economic debate that American liberals — uniquely in the Western world — champion cultural issues like same-sex marriage equality while avoiding serious confrontation with the structural sources of socio-economic inequality . Their ideological cowardice has left them turning sensible reform proposals like single-payer health insurance into the Frankenstein’s monster of government-subsidized private enterprise that is the Affordable Care Act . It’s tough to cheerlead for a clumsy , compromised law that satisfies no one ; no wonder they have failed to persuasively defend it in this election .On the right , the steady expansion of civil rights and the onward march of secularization have compelled conservatives to accept the political rules of multiculturalism ( while occasionally reserving the right to protest in the name of religious liberty ) . But the fact that most Republican leaders — at least those deemed fit for prime time — have mastered politically correct language does not mean that the party admits that liberal identity politics reflect legitimate minority grievances . Nor does it mean that they have confronted the prejudice and self-interest in their own ranks .Americans like to think of themselves as down-to-earth problem-solvers who live in a post-ideological society — even , in their more Pollyannaish moments , an almost-post-racial one . They imagine they are immune to the noxious -isms that wracked 20th-century Europe . In 1960 , the sociologist Daniel Bell proclaimed the “end of ideology” : a good thing , in his view . An ideology , he wrote , looks “at the world with eyes wide shut , a closed system which prefabricates answers to any questions that might be asked.” At their worst , ideologies are indeed “smelly little orthodoxies , ” as George Orwell put it — and identity politics can close minds , too . But at their best , they force us to confront the assumptions that drive our kneejerk reactions , to acknowledge the logic of our own beliefs and to follow that logic to its political conclusion . They force honest debate about how to balance competition between worthy but conflicting goals and can yield imaginative solutions to the challenge of living together in free society .When I ask students in my history classes to read part of Bell’s book , they always tell me that now that they’ve stopped to look , they see that he spoke too soon . We all have assumptions and allegiances that shape our priorities and our reactions to new information : Creeds and tribalisms abound . This election is not about “nothing.” It turns on the basic philosophical divides and racial tensions that have defined American politics since the country’s founding . It’s just too bad hardly anyone is talking about it .
Shortly after the birth of her daughter , Andrea became severely depressed . She was 17 at the time and she didn’t fully understand what she was going through ; she just felt like a failure . “I felt like I didn’t want to be alive , ” she recalls . “I felt like I didn’t deserve to be alive . I felt like a bad person and a bad mother , and I was never going to get any better.”When her baby persisted in crying , she felt her frustration mount quickly . “I was hitting a boiling point , ” she says . “I was at a point where I didn’t want to deal with anything . Sometimes I would just let her cry — but then I would feel very bad afterwards.”Depression is the most common health problem women face . In the United States , outside of obstetrics , it is the leading cause of hospitalizations among women ages 15 to 44 . It’s estimated that 20 percent to 25 percent of women will experience depression during their lifetimes , and about one in seven will experience postpartum depression . For low-income women , the rates are about twice as high . As my colleague Tina Rosenberg has reported , the World Health Organization ranks depression as the most burdensome of all health conditions affecting women ( as measured by lost years of productive life ) .Postpartum depressions are often assumed to be associated with hormonal changes in women . In fact , only a small fraction of them are hormonally based , said Cindy-Lee Dennis , a professor at the University of Toronto and a senior scientist at Women’s College Research Institute , who holds a Canada Research Chair in Perinatal Community Health .The misconception is itself a major obstacle , she adds . Postpartum depression is often not an isolated form of depression ; nor is it typical . “We now consider depression to be a chronic condition , ” Dennis says . “It reoccurs in approximately 30 to 50 percent of individuals . And a significant proportion of postpartum depression starts during the pregnancy but is not detected or treated to remission . We need to identify symptoms as early as possible , ideally long before birth.”The major predictors include previous incidents of depression , as well as a woman’s past and current life stresses , like childhood trauma or abuse , conflicts with a partner or family members , lack of social support or coping skills , and poverty .Only about 20 percent to 30 percent of women who experience postpartum depression in the United States get proper treatment , and for low-income mothers , the rate is considerably lower , says Robert T. Ammerman , a professor of pediatrics at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center who is the scientific director of Every Child Succeeds , a home visiting program for vulnerable first-time mothers .The consequences for both mother and child can be devastating . If left untreated , postpartum depression can develop into severe clinical depression . In addition to feeling listless , anxious , guilty , lonely and frequently suicidal , mothers who are clinically depressed in pregnancy are three to four times more likely to have a premature delivery or deliver a low-birth-weight baby ( both predictors of serious developmental and medical problems for the child ) and , just as urgent , less likely to form healthy attachments with their children . Their children are more likely to have attention deficits , difficulties controlling their emotions and behavior , language delays and lower I.Q.s — and they are themselves at increased risk of becoming depressed later in life ( PDF ) .“We have this idea that during motherhood struggling with emotional issues is normal , ” Ammerman says . “The message that a lot of moms hear from families and friends and even professionals who may not know much about perinatal depression is ‘be tough and fight your way through it’ — and they don’t seek help.”Ammerman says that while it’s true that many mothers have or develop depression , it’s not a normal or typical response to the challenges of parenting . There are effective treatments . They include medication as well as a range of therapies – like cognitive behavioral therapy ( C.B.T . ) , which helps people learn how to counter negative thoughts and their associated emotions , and interpersonal psychotherapy ( I.P.T . ) , which focuses on improving the quality of personal relationships and the satisfaction that is gained from them . About a third of women who get treated for chronic or recurrent depression achieve remission , and more than half see an improvement in their symptoms .Today , several states , including Illinois , New Jersey , West Virginia and Washington , have initiated mandatory screening for perinatal depression ( something that is done nationally in Australia ) . But inadequate screening is only part of the problem . Cost and access barriers and stigmatization – and an overall lack of awareness among health professionals – are what prevent most mothers who need help from getting it . Many primary care doctors fail to recognize when their patients are depressed . And when they do , they often don’t know how to provide the most effective treatments . They also can’t ensure that patients will follow up with mental health professionals ( many of whom do not accept Medicaid ) . And communication between doctors is notoriously problematic .“When people are referred to mental health professionals from primary care settings , the vast majority of the referral slips go into the garbage , ” says Katherine L. Wisner , director of the Asher Center for the Study and Treatment of Depressive Disorders at Northwestern University .Given the scope of the problem , new outreach and treatment models are urgently needed . The three that I’m highlighting today are noteworthy because they demonstrate promise and illustrate pathways for potentially broader system changes .The first is a collaborative care model called DAWN being pioneered at two urban obstetrics and gynecology ( ob-gyn ) clinics that are part of the University of Washington system . The innovation here is that mental health care is being integrated directly into ob-gyn care . Why is this such an important idea ? About a third of women in the country see their ob-gyn physicians for their primary care , explains Wayne Katon , vice chair of the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the University of Washington School of Medicine . When depression screening and treatment are handled in the same place as primary care , it’s more likely that women will get effective help .Through the DAWN program , when a woman comes in for care , she is screened for depression using a standard questionnaire known as PHQ-9 . If her score indicates a likelihood of major depression , she is assigned a care manager who is trained to educate her about depression , explore real or perceived barriers in her life and motivate her to pursue treatment .It’s important that treatments are designed to fit with a patient’s preferences . “They’re given the choice to start with a form of therapy or an antidepressant , ” Katon says . “Some say , ‘I’m pregnant , I’d rather not be on medication.’ Some want to take medication.” They can also choose in-person visits or telephone consultations . Physician-supervised care managers follow up regularly for a year , tracking patients’ progress . If their symptoms persist , they adjust or increase the intensity of treatment .In two studies published this year , women experienced significant improvements in depressive symptoms . The gains were particularly notable among women who were uninsured or received public insurance , such as Medicaid . “The women were more satisfied with the care they got and the ob-gyn doctors were more satisfied because their patients got better , ” Katon adds .The second model was developed by Every Child Succeeds , a home visiting program for vulnerable first-time mothers based out of the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center . In recent years , as I have reported in this column , home visiting programs have spread across the country as a result of a $ 1.5 billion appropriation in the Affordable Care Act . This summer , a study of families served by the Nurse-Family Partnership found , remarkably , that the mothers and children assisted by the program had significantly lower death rates over a 20-year period .But home visiting programs have one notable limitation . As recent research indicates , when mothers are clinically depressed , they don’t benefit as much from the visits . “A mother who is depressed has very little to give her child , ” said Judith B . Van Ginkel , the founder of Every Child Succeeds , which has worked with 22,000 families . “We found that half of the mothers we were working with were depressed , and three-quarters had witnessed or been victims of violence.”With the leadership of Robert Ammerman and others , Every Child Succeeds has developed a program called Moving Beyond Depression , to train therapists to deliver C.B.T . in conjunction with home visitation .This is how Andrea was able to receive treatment . Shortly after her home visits started , Andrea , who lives just north of Cincinnati and works in a call center , was asked to fill out a questionnaire . ( I have changed her name . ) She learned that she was depressed . “I had been in denial , ” she said . For months , conflicts with her mother had been getting worse . Her mother suffered from mental illness and depression , had used drugs , and had long counted on , and expected , Andrea to take care of her .But now Andrea needed every ounce of her strength to care for her baby , and her mother reacted angrily . Over 15 sessions , the therapist helped Andrea develop strategies to manage her feelings and interactions with her mother — rather than being thrown repeatedly to anger , negative thoughts and guilt .Last year , results from a clinical trial funded by the National Institute of Mental Health showed that mothers receiving Moving Beyond Depression’s in-home C.B.T . model experienced subtantial improvements in depressive symptoms and decreased diagnosis of major depressive disorder following treatment relative to a control group . The model has spread to several states , including Connecticut , Massachusetts , Kentucky and Kansas , and has been used to assist 600 mothers .The third model grows out of Cindy-Lee Dennis’s research in Canada , and is important because it illustrates the potential of treating women through interventions over the phone . It thus reduces one of the biggest barriers low-income or rural women face in accessing treatment : transportation to and from treatment and scheduling appointments .In one clinical trial , 700 women in the first two weeks after giving birth , who had been identified as being at a high risk of postpartum depression , were given telephone-based peer support from other mothers — volunteers from the community who had previously experienced and recovered from self-reported postpartum depression ( and received four hours of training ) .“We created a support network for the mothers early in the postpartum period , ” Dennis explains . “It cut the risk of depression by 50 percent.” On average , each mother received just eight contacts — calls or messages , and the calls averaged 14 minutes . Over 80 percent of the mothers said they would recommend this support to a friend .In another clinical trial conducted by Dennis , trained nurses provided interpersonal psychotherapy ( I.P.T . ) over the phone to 240 clinically depressed mothers across Canada . The calls were scheduled at the mothers’ convenience . The results have not been published yet , but Dennis says the treatment was highly effective . Treatment compliance rates were greater than 85 percent . Dennis is currently working with health officials to pilot test the model in New York City .“We underestimate very simple interventions , ” she says . “We have this huge bias that face to face is the most effective way to provide care . But we have to be innovative about how we offer help to women.”Andrea , who is now 19 , remains grateful for the help she received . “I can actually focus on my daughter and be with her the way I want to be with her , and teach her things , ” she says . “I feel like now that I’ve been through the program — and distanced myself from people I needed to — I can focus on what I need to focus on rather than everybody else’s problems . There’s more out there than just being depressed.”Join Fixes on Facebook and follow updates on twitter.com/nytimesfixes .

Gail Collins : David , I was pretty confident that the United States had Ebola under control until the other day , when it appeared policy-making had devolved to Andrew Cuomo and Chris Christie . Chris Christie , who can’t keep bridge traffic moving . Andrew Cuomo , who failed to get his 2012 flu shot until 2013 .David Brooks : This is why we’re a republic and not a democracy . People running for office should not be making science policy . By the way , I’ve been against quarantines and overreaction through this whole thing , but there was a piece in The New Republic a few weeks ago that sobered me . Steven Beutler , an infectious disease specialist , was arguing for a maximalist response . Here’s one core point : “Medicine can be a very humbling profession , and after more than 30 years of practicing infectious-disease medicine , I have learned that the ‘unanticipated’ happens all too often , especially where microbes are involved.”Gail : Do you think the Ebola hysteria will have any effect on next week’s election ? There’s been a lot of complaint about the administration’s ineptitude . But I think the message on Ebola , at least , has been the opposite . Ebola in the United States began deep in the heart of Texas , a state whose health care system is so estranged from the federal government it refuses to accept the opportunity to get its millions of uninsured residents covered under Obamacare .David : Your love of all things Texas is well known . But you have to admit a few things about the place . It is economically vibrant beyond all reckoning . Houston and Dallas are exploding economically while the rest of the country dawdles .Gail : Texas is the last gasp of the Sunbelt boom . It has all the advantages of warm weather , plus an enormous amount of space which makes housing stupendously cheap . It could have done just as well without being politically crazy .But we were talking about Ebola .David : As for Ebola and the election , my pretentious theory is that Ebola is the objective correlative of the campaign .Gail : You’re using big words again .David : If I remember high school English correctly , an “objective correlative” is an object that gives explicit access to the meaning of vague and insubstantial things , like a mood or an emotion . It’s an object that correlates to a mood or emotion or idea . T.S . Eliot made it famous writing about Hamlet .Anyway , the country was already afraid . It felt like the people running things were not quite up to the job . Along comes a disease to perfectly embody that vague sense . That said , I don’t think Ebola is swinging too many votes . People are just sour and they are disappointed with the president .Gail : It certainly has been a tough season for President Obama . But before we start blaming him for anything bad that happens next Tuesday , I would like to give him a shout-out for that hug-the-Ebola-nurse photo . Which allows us to recall that when AIDS hit the United States in 1981 , President Ronald Reagan was criminally useless . Never said a word . As Laura Helmuth noted in Slate this week , Reagan’s press secretary made fun of the idea that the president would ever consider speaking out .David : I totally agree with you on that one . It’s not in the president’s job description to be the professional emoter and behavior model , but when he can display some truth by example , he might as well do it .Gail : I know I’m preparing my defenses in advance of next week . But I think the American people have been saying they want an effective government , not a smaller government . All the candidates are promising they’re going to end gridlock , but if there’s anything we’ve learned since Obama was elected , it’s that you don’t end gridlock by sending more Tea Party types to Washington .David : I guess I think it is more generalized than that . They just don’t trust government to get the job done . At least the federal government . I’m struck by how amazingly stable polling has been on the Affordable Care Act . Democrats in swing states don’t try to defend it . They just promise to fix it . The relatively good news on the health care front over the past year has done nothing to change minds .Gail : I find it sort of fascinating that the Republican Senate nominee in Iowa , who previously said she’d support a law to have federal officials arrested for attempting to implement Obamacare , is marketing herself as the “Iowa nice” candidate who can work across the aisle .David : I find it shocking that Iowans should steal Minnesota’s slogan . Minnesota is the nice state . Missouri is the skeptical state . New Jersey is the brash state . Iowa should be the quiet state .In her defense I think it is possible to arrest federal officials nicely . We call it compassionate conservatism .Gail : O.K. , this is the point at which we’re morally obliged to start making predictions . What’s yours ?David : I say this with no great confidence , but I’m guessing the Republicans pick up eight seats . I think the biggest surprise will be a G.O.P . win in Georgia .Gail : That would make me sad , if only because Michelle Nunn has run such a good race and her opponent has been so terrible . It just seems unjust .My guess is that we’re not going to know who gets control of the Senate for a while . Some state is going to be so close there’ll be a recount . And Alaska takes forever to just get the ballots together . Plus Georgia and Louisiana , which will probably go to runoffs , since they require their senators to get a majority of the vote .David : Great ! Why shouldn’t the decade’s most content-less campaign go into overtime ? I’m sort of amazed that this election hasn’t been about jobs and the economy . It hasn’t been about anything but a sort of fatalism .Gail : There’s something about the idea of the fate of the nation hanging on Louisiana that makes me very nervous . I still remember being down there in 1991 , covering the gubernatorial runoff between the Ku Klux Klan wizard David Duke and the deeply corrupt ex-governor Edwin Edwards . The Edwards supporters had those bumper stickers saying : “Vote for the Crook.” Which , blessedly , the people did .David : I’ll take an effective crook over an ineffective honest person any day .Gail : I should mention that at age 87 , Edwards is running for the House of Representatives this year . After getting out of jail , marrying a woman 51 years younger , and starring in a reality TV series . You can’t say Louisiana isn’t interesting . And if there’s a runoff at least then we’d be able to spend part of the winter in New Orleans . So much better than next year , when we’ll be spending it in Des Moines .David : I was just in New Orleans last week . I love every street in that city except Bourbon Street , which is filled with terrible pizza places , extremely drunk idiots and teenagers mortified to be walking with their parents .Gong there makes me want to reread my favorite political novel of all time , Robert Penn Warren’s “All the King’s Men.” Trollope’s “Phineas Finn” is second .And don’t knock Des Moines . Silence is golden .Gail : What’s the state you’re following most closely ? I have to admit Kansas is pretty darned fascinating . If the Republicans have to ferry in any more old party stalwarts to shore up Senator Pat Roberts , they’ll be resurrecting Alf Landon .I got a twinge watching Bob Dole campaign so vigorously for Roberts . Do you remember in 2012 when Dole was sitting in the Senate , in his wheelchair , watching his friends refuse to ratify the United Nations treaty on people with disabilities ? Which was based , of course , on the signature bill Dole got passed in 1990 when he was in the Senate .David : Somebody should please explain to me why senators don’t ever want to retire . What’s fun about attending Ag Committee hearings when you are 84 ? Maybe the napping opportunities .Gail : I talked with Dole after the treaty vote , and he kept coming back to the fact that both of the Republican Senators from Kansas had voted against ratification . But there’s Roberts now , in a deep ditch because he took his constituents so much for granted he didn’t even bother to pretend he lived in their state . Dole clearly has a much deeper sense of loyalty .David : I once went to the Dole center in Kansas . They’ve got a sort of museum display about his life . The thing that moved me most was the exercise equipment he used to build himself back into shape after his war injury . He had wasted away to nothing and had to build himself all the way back . Then I got to see the basement where they keep all the presents he had been given by foreign dignitaries during his Senate years . There were carpets , saddles , baseball bats . People give politicians portraits of themselves . I guess that’s called knowing your subject .Gail : It’s interesting how many elections there are this year where voters seem to despise both candidates . If Floridians were any more alienated by their governor’s race , they’d have been bringing alligators to the debates .David : I don’t think Floridians should be angry or alienated . It doesn’t suit them . Among other things , it doesn’t go with their pastels .Gail : I don’t want anybody to imagine that I’m making fun of other states because of my deep satisfaction with New York . Nothing is more humbling than spending a season covering New York politics . Where the phrase “not yet indicted” is regarded as a compliment .David : If Minnesota is nice and Iowa is quiet , what should New York be : Pompous ? Narcissistic ? I say this lovingly . It is my state too .Gail : Last question . Is there anything about this election that’s really surprised you ? I didn’t expect to see so much of Mitt Romney on the campaign trail . Do you think he’s actually interested in running again ? They say third time’s a charm .David : Trust me . He isn’t running . I think his wife sort of ruled that out . That documentary released after the election revealed him to be an authentically warm and nice guy . If there are three things that don’t seem to work in politics these days it’s authenticity , niceness and warmth . Doesn’t fit the national mood .
MY trainer , a 31-year-old black man , doesn’t vote . It doesn’t make any difference which party wins , he says . He doesn’t believe that President Obama is really in charge .I respect my trainer . An injury last year ended his professional boxing career . He sometimes works 12-hour days , exhorting client after client . He and his girlfriend have a 3-year-old daughter ; he is supporting his girlfriend while she earns a master’s degree . He himself did not go to college , but he got off the Harlem streets . He says that he saved himself from the player’s life of his father , who is younger than I am .His ambition , his sheer work ethic , make it disheartening for me to hear him say that the Illuminati , or the Trilateral Commission , or some secret council of white men straight out of Ishmael Reed’s early satires , control our destinies . This is the kind of thing black nationalists used to say in the 1970s , when they argued that to join the system was to fall for the white man’s con . To hear my young trainer give voice to such fatalism tells me how easily black people can lose faith in the democratic process , become disaffected , alienated , in spite of the amazing fact that there is a black man in the White House .Nearly 50 years before Mr. Obama was first elected , the Rev . Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said that racist whites were not the only obstacles to the black vote . Black people had to overcome the intimidation and fear they had internalized after centuries of slavery and decades of Jim Crow . The black vote increased significantly after passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965 . Civil rights organizations took an active role in the education of black voters , teaching them how to be comfortable with the exercise of the franchise . Black candidates won mayoral and congressional elections in the early 1970s , when the black population was concentrated in major cities . In the 1980s , black voters in the Democratic primaries made Jesse L. Jackson Sr.’s presidential bids more than symbolic . In the days of the Reagan and Bush backlashes , black candidates needed to have broad appeal , but the coalitions that elected Carol Moseley Braun a senator from Illinois , in 1992 , Deval L. Patrick the governor of Massachusetts , in 2006 , and Mr. Obama a senator , also from Illinois , in 2004 , and then president , in 2008 , had the black vote at their cores .Black turnout outstripped white turnout in 2012 , when Mr. Obama won every major demographic group — except white men . As the political scientist Martin L. Kilson notes in his recent book , “Transformation of the African American Intelligentsia , 1880-2012 , ” Mr. Obama stands at the apex of an African-American political class comprising 10,000 elected black officeholders in cities , counties and state legislatures , 43 members of the United States Congress , a black attorney general , a black national security adviser , black secretaries of homeland security and transportation , a black deputy White House chief of staff for policy , and other black policy makers and administrators . Yet — as Mr. Obama’s critics on the left point out — conditions for black people over all have sunk back to what they had been around the time of Dr. King’s assassination : more than a third of black children are born into poverty ; there are more black men in the criminal justice system than there are black men in college ; the median income of blacks has fallen ; unemployment among blacks remains higher than the national average . As the former New York Times columnist Bob Herbert said , “We know all this , but no one seems to know how to turn things around.”An Okinawan-Japanese high school classmate of the president’s explained to me after the first inaugural that in Hawaii everyone is a mongrel , and where you come from doesn’t matter . But once the young Mr. Obama went to Los Angeles for college , and was treated as a black youth by the police , he understood what his brave white mother had made him learn during all those mornings of reading black history before school in Indonesia .Some people want to say that Mr. Obama somehow isn’t with blacks , because he does not descend from people who were enslaved . He is the son of an immigrant — a Kenyan graduate student who was just passing through . Those who say that that somehow makes him different , or less black , don’t know enough about the violence and oppression of colonialism . Class doesn’t determine how black people feel about Mr. Obama . Who supports him in black America and who doesn’t is largely a generational question . Just as my father was jealous of and ambivalent about Mr. Obama , because Mr. Obama had achieved something that blacks of the G.I . Bill generation had not thought possible , so young black people like my trainer miss in the president the performance and tone that historical footage of the civil rights era has subtly led them to expect of black leaders — an impassioned challenger of the system , someone coming from the outside .I am 60 years old — how did that happen ? — and to me , what Mr. Obama has accomplished is far from insignificant : He saved us from economic meltdown , he got us out of Iraq and Afghanistan , and he signed the Affordable Care Act . He would perhaps be the first to admit we still have far to go . Because I am an old head now , I can accept incremental change , even value it . I voted for him , though I know he is more of a capitalist than I am . I voted for him twice , though in my heart I can not forgive him for turning to economics advisers like Lawrence H. Summers ( whom I despise ) . And I am dismayed by those who are obsessed by the mysteries of Mr. Obama’s personality , by his distance , his opacity . Nobody can make him lose his cool , just as nobody can move him from the center . So long as he occupies the middle ground as president , the Republicans are forced to stay on the right . Most of the world is relieved that the president of the United States is a man of integrity and intelligence . But here he is described as a flawed politician , a man not cut out for trench warfare , not the man for our historical moment . His early notion that the country could reconcile in him because of his personal story is dismissed as naïve .Mr. Obama is criticized for not having done more for black people — not because they are black people , but because they are among his party’s most loyal supporters . Yet many whites resent or are afraid of those moments when the president seems to be taking the black side , speaking from the black point of view . Black people in turn can be frustrated that the black point of view is always ghettoized , never allowed to be , simply , the American point of view — especially when the issue at hand is about social justice . Historically , blacks have looked to the federal government for protection against the doctrine of states’ rights , a euphemism for the reactionary in American politics . But Mr. Obama’s experience in office has shown blacks the limits of executive power .All my adult life , the argument in black America concerning electoral politics has been about trusting the system , wondering if trying to be a part of the mainstream was possible or worth it . To join the larger society involves a loss , the sacrifice of authentic blackness , some black people would say . Throughout black American history , white people have demanded that black people prove their readiness to become full citizens , which is why I really don’t like it when President Obama or Bill Cosby chastises blacks for their behavior . As James Baldwin so often said : He wasn’t the problem , white people were the problem . There are white Americans who can not forgive him for having won . They can’t handle the fact that a black man is in charge of the money , of so much patronage and power . Black people didn’t shut down the government ; white people did . To such whites , it’s a matter of ownership , not partnership .If who wins doesn’t matter , then Republicans on the right would not be trying to suppress the black vote . They , too , have heard what the demographics promise . Single mothers now account for a third of eligible voters ; most newborns are members of a “minority” group . Republicans have gerrymandered districts so that they can win the House without the Latino vote , and districts have also been redrawn so as to reduce the impact of the black vote either by spreading it around or confining it . Conservative opposition to inclusive democracy has not changed in substance since the immigrant vote was routinely suppressed , along with the black vote , in the late 19th century , back when voter registration days in New York could just so happen to fall on Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur ( as I learned from the historian Alexander Keyssar ) . The vote , power elites contended , was a privilege , not a right . Distrust of direct democracy is as much an American tradition as the quest for freedom .The shooting in Ferguson , Mo. , did not leave the news , because demonstrators stayed in the streets , just as Occupy Wall Street movement brought up the urgent matter of wage and wealth inequality and has not let the subject go . Maybe we are at the beginning of another age of activism on the part of youth . In Europe , disaffection from the major political parties has benefited far-right politicians . In America , the rabid Tea Party is the beneficiary . Mr. Obama said somewhere that troublemakers were catalysts for positive change , while others were caretakers of that change . History will remember him as the calm president who steered the nation through dangerous waters .
Like confused poll respondents , Scott Brown , the former Massachusetts Senator who’s running for Senate in New Hampshire , says he thinks the Affordable Care Act is disastrous , but seems to like everything it does .Via VoxIn an interview with WBUR , he called Obamacare a “disaster.” Then he was asked what he’s for — and he went on to describe Obamacare . “I’ve always felt that people should either get some type of health care options , or pay for it with a nice competitive fee , ” he said . “That’s all great . I believe it in my heart . In terms of preexisting conditions , catastrophic coverages , covering kids , whatever we want to do.” He even said it could “include the Medicaid expansion [ for ] folks who need that care and coverage.”Oh , he also promises his plan won’t raise taxes , cut spending on Medicare , or make people drive very far to go to the hospital . So his plan will have more generous insurance options and no way to pay for them . In other words , his plan will be like Obamacare , but even better ! Call it Fauxbamacare .
WHO is a person ? How do you qualify for basic human rights ? What is required for you to be able to speak or worship freely or to be free from torture ?Throughout American history , the Supreme Court has considered and reconsidered the criteria for membership in the club of rights , oscillating between a vision limiting rights to preferred groups and another granting rights to all who require protection . These competing visions have led to some strange results .Corporations ( as well as unions ) can spend on political speech to further their group interests as though they were individual political actors . Corporations can assert religious rights to gain legal exemptions from laws that would otherwise apply to them . Muslim detainees at Guantánamo Bay , however , have none of these rights .As a corporate litigator who has also spent more than a decade defending Guantánamo detainees , I have been trying to figure out why corporations are worthy of court protection and Muslims held in indefinite detention without trial by the United States at a naval base in Cuba are not .The direction of the Supreme Court under Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. over the past decade has been anything but consistent . As the court readies itself for another term , it may not be possible to speak of a Roberts court jurisprudence at all . Even within the conservative and liberal blocs there are a range of views on the limits of executive power , the relationship between the federal government and the states , the protection of politically expressive speech and the applicability of the Constitution abroad . But the bulk of the most controversial cases come down to 4-to-4 bloc voting , with Justice Anthony M. Kennedy’s worldview defining the court’s path .But we are not completely in the dark about who is likely to be granted legally enforceable rights and who is not . This term the court will consider whether Arkansas can force a Muslim prisoner to shave his beard , whether a Muslim woman who wears a head scarf can get a job at Abercrombie & Fitch , and whether Alabama can cram African-American voters into a few districts to dilute their political impact .The Roberts court has already charted a course in which rights are extended to those who have real clout in American society and denied to those who are more marginal . In two critical cases , Citizens United and Hobby Lobby , the court decided by a 5-to-4 vote that corporations had broad rights of speech and of religion , which left corporate owners in a position to trumpet their political and religious views while diminishing or even silencing other voices .In Citizens United , the court held that corporations had the right under the First Amendment to spend unlimited amounts on election advertising . The court evaded the issue of whether corporations were legal “persons” with rights , finding that the political process was always improved by more speech rather than less . Justice Kennedy , writing for the court , found that corporate spending contributed to the dissemination of information and ideas that “the First Amendment seeks to foster.” He rejected the argument that corporations should be limited “simply because such associations are not ‘natural persons.’ ”But Congress limits speech all the time . Foreign nationals , for example , even those who live legally in the United States , are not permitted to make campaign contributions or expenditures . They may be “persons , ” but for First Amendment purposes , they are not legitimate speakers . Unless , of course , they own shares in corporations .The Supreme Court’s decision said nothing about the interests of the corporation or the identity of its stakeholders . Chinese or Russian shareholders could gain control of an American corporation and use shareholder funds to influence elections in the United States . According to the court , money is speech , and once it is corporate money , it is laundered of its foreign taint .In Hobby Lobby , the court considered whether corporations had the right to deprive employees of contraceptive coverage required under the Affordable Care Act , based on the religious objections of their controlling shareholders . The court applied the Dictionary Act , an obscure statute from 1871 that says that a reference in a given statute to a “person” includes corporations “unless the context indicates otherwise.” Normal dictionaries do not define persons to include corporations . Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr.’s opinion takes a “just folks” view of the matter : “A corporation is simply a form of organization used by human beings to achieve desired ends.”This inability to make the distinction between individual corporate stakeholders and the legal fiction of the corporation is not only weird , it is bad corporate law . Whatever else corporations may be , they are not the sum of their people . In her dissent , Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg cited Chief Justice John Marshall’s two-centuries-old observation that a corporation is “an artificial being , invisible , intangible and existing only in contemplation of law.”The modern corporation is a brilliant invention of 19th-century capitalism that creates a separate entity — a legal “person” — that can enter into contracts , borrow money , sue and be sued without exposing its shareholders to personal liability . The shareholders are not the corporation ; directors , executives and employees aren’t either . Shareholders , executives and employees do have religious rights — as individuals . Hobby Lobby does not expand anyone’s religious rights . What it does do is allow the religious beliefs of the owners of a company to trump the beliefs of its employees .The Supreme Court did not declare Hobby Lobby a person with religious rights because it was confused about whether a corporation could pray or have a bar mitzvah . The court chose to allow business owners to retain the powerful protection of limited liability while awarding them the further benefit of an exemption from the financial obligations of the Affordable Care Act . The majority took one definition of a legal person and used it as a hook to impose its own views about the importance of religion and business in American public life . When she was asked recently which court decision during her tenure would be most significant 50 years from now , Justice Ginsburg noted the strangeness inherent in the court’s reasoning : “Well , ” she said , “I think 50 years from now , people will not be able to understand Hobby Lobby.”IN holding that corporations had religious rights , the Hobby Lobby decision sat in contrast to a case I brought under the same statute in 2004 , in which the court found that Muslims at Guantánamo Bay were not persons and had no religious rights .That case , Rasul v. Rumsfeld , alleged that Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and the chain of command had established a regime at Guantánamo that systematically humiliated and abused detainees when they tried to practice their religion . In an attempt to break these people , guards threw Qurans in the toilet bucket , blasted rock music to interrupt prayers and forced prisoners to pray with their genitals exposed .To me , the case seemed open-and-shut . The Religious Freedom Restoration Act ( R.F.R.A . ) , which was passed in 1993 , prohibits the government from “substantially” burdening “a person’s exercise of religion” unless it serves some important government interest that can not be accomplished in any other way . My clients were “persons” ; throwing Qurans in the toilet bucket certainly made it difficult for them to worship ; and it served no governmental interest to humiliate people who were praying .The Federal District Court in Washington , which first heard the case , agreed that “R.F.R.A . expressly protects the religious exercise of ‘persons , ’ a broadly applicable term , commonly including aliens.” But the government appealed and the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that , as aliens held outside the United States , these men were not “persons” after all . The Bush administration had put them offshore precisely to ensure this .Even the arch-conservative Judge Janice Rogers Brown , who once said that “in the heyday of liberal democracy , all roads lead to slavery , ” was uncomfortable , noting in concurrence , “It leaves us with the unfortunate and quite dubious distinction of being the only court to declare those held at Guantánamo are not ‘persons.’ This is a most regrettable holding in a case where plaintiffs have alleged high-level U.S. government officials treated them as less than human.”The case went to the Supreme Court twice . The first time the court ordered the court of appeals to reconsider the case , which it duly did , reaching the same conclusion . The second time the Supreme Court declined to hear the case and the appeals court decision remains the law .So while Muslims in United States custody do not have redress from the coarsest attacks on their religious dignity , corporations do have religious rights that the law protects . Why were my clients , undeniably actual people , abused when they worshiped , while state-chartered artificial entities were allowed an exemption from the law in deference to the religious beliefs of their shareholders ?One possibility is that detainees are excluded because they are aliens outside the United States . But the Supreme Court held in 2008 in Boumediene v. Bush , again with a 5-to-4 vote , that detainees at Guantánamo did have the constitutional right to habeas corpus . To rule otherwise , Justice Kennedy wrote , would be to hold that the “political branches have the power to switch the Constitution on or off at will” based on where the executive has chosen to bring prisoners . Under this reasoning , the Constitution should be a backpack that travels with governmental authority and protects those subject to American custody .Justice Antonin Scalia was apoplectic . Warning of “disastrous consequences , ” he wrote in dissent that “today , for the first time in our nation’s history , the court confers a constitutional right to habeas corpus on alien enemies detained abroad by our military forces in the course of an ongoing war.” His dire prediction : “It will almost certainly cause more Americans to be killed.”He need not have worried . As Judge Laurence H. Silberman , a mainstay of the conservative D.C . Circuit , wrote in a concurrence in 2011 , Boumediene was a “charade , ” a “defiant — if only theoretical — assertion of judicial supremacy.” The courts refused to extend habeas or any other rights to detainees at bases other than Guantánamo . No detainee has ever been released as a direct result of an American court order . As a practical matter , aliens in American custody outside the United States have no enforceable rights . President Obama has forbidden torture by executive order . Yet his predecessor allowed torture , and so could his successor . Whatever else may go into the knapsacks of military personnel , the Constitution is not on the packing list .As the Roberts court begins its 10th term , there is a clear shift away from decades of jurisprudence in which the court envisioned its role as protector of the essential human dignity of those who lacked the political power to protect themselves . Justice William J. Brennan Jr. called the Constitution “a sublime oration on the dignity of man.” But historically the Supreme Court had ignored the dignity of a broad section of humanity : Native Americans , slaves , women , racial minorities , aliens , Japanese internees , gays and lesbians , and now Muslims at Guantánamo .The current court is solicitous of those who pool their capital and obtain the protection of the corporate form . It is sympathetic toward the interests of mainstream elites , expanding religion , protecting commercial wealth and even protecting gay rights , an issue that crosses class lines . The dignity of prisoners , employees , or ethnic and racial minorities is far less likely to engage the moral imagination of this court .Years ago , my constitutional law professor , Judge Robert H. Bork , taught us about the cases that challenged the government edict that ordered the rounding up of citizens of Japanese ancestry into remote internment camps during World War II . The Supreme Court upheld that order by a vote of 6 to 3 , finding that “the military urgency of the situation demanded that all citizens of Japanese ancestry be segregated from the West Coast.” Judge Bork was no progressive , but he told us that he was shocked that “we the people” could so easily succumb to racist , nativist hysteria . Surely it could never happen again .It takes courage for the Supreme Court to stand up for the powerless and the despised . Sometimes it has risen to the challenge and sometimes it has not . With the Roberts court , what we see is a self-referential worldview , which leads the court to enhance the rights of insiders and deny protection to outsiders . On Monday , the justices will begin another term with the question of whether their commitment to the protection of human dignity will be universal or limited to “persons” just like them .
Conservatives appear to be really upset that liberals are actually taking on the facts in the anti-Obamacare ads they’ve been running . How dare you question whether the people in these ads are giving an accurate picture — they’re suffering !OK , we’ve seen this kind of play before . Remember how anyone suggesting that Dick Cheney and whatshisname misled us into invading Iraq was attacking American’s brave fighting men and women ?But there’s a different kind of struggle anyone trying to point out the facts encounters — a barrage of anecdotes . You say that the Obamacare horror stories are fake , but I kind of know this man who is being told that he has to buy a policy he can’t possibly afford / I read this sad story in the Wall Street Journal / I heard this tale on the radio / etc..How do you answer that ?Well , it can’t be done retail . If the Koch brothers are pouring money into ads featuring a person , or the GOP response to the SOTU tells a story , then it’s worth trying to track down the particulars of this case . But to deal with the broader problem of anecdotes , what you need is a framework that tells you which anecdotes are almost surely wrong .So here’s what you need to understand . The Affordable Care Act isn’t magic — it produces losers as well as winners . But it’s not black magic either , turning everyone into a loser . What the Act does is in effect to increase the burden on fortunate people — the healthy and wealthy — to lift some burdens on the less fortunate : people with chronic illnesses or other preexisting conditions , low-income workers .Suppose , then , that someone comes to you with an anecdote about a cancer patient , or just an older person in poor health , and tells you that this person is about to lose the care she needs , or face a huge increase in expenses , under Obamacare . Well , it’s almost certainly not true — people like that are overwhelmingly beneficiaries of health reform , thanks to community rating , which means that they can’t be discriminated against because of their condition .Or suppose that someone tells you about a struggling worker who had adequate coverage but is now being confronted with unaffordable premiums . You should immediately ask , what about the subsidies ? Because the Affordable Care Act has subsidies that are there specifically to keep premiums affordable for lower earners .If someone insists that he knows about someone in these categories who really is being grievously hurt , well , the burden of proof rests with the claimant . Basically , stories like that are going to be very rare .Obamacare opponents could , of course , go with the real losers — people in the one percent paying higher taxes , healthy young men who are getting by with cheap , minimalist policies . But they want sob stories — the sick middle-aged woman facing tragedy . And so far , every single one of those sob stories has turned out to be false — because the very nature of the reform is such that such things hardly ever happen .
Until just the other day , Obamacare was a total disaster ; no way would it meet its first-year enrollment targets , or come anywhere close .Now the opponents have retreated to their next line of defense : OK , people are signing up , but only because their existing policies were cancelled , so the program isn’t actually reducing the number of uninsured .Oops:Furthermore:These early estimates understate the full effects of the Affordable Care Act on the uninsured for two major reasons . First , the survey does not capture the enrollment surge that occurred at the end of the open enrollment period , because 80 percent of the responses to the March 2014 HRMS were provided by March 6 , 2014 . Second , these estimates do not reflect the effects of some important ACA provisions ( such as the ability to keep dependents on health plans until age 26 and early state Medicaid expansions ) that were implemented before 2013 .Remember , this is just the first year . It has been assumed all along that it would take several years for the word to spread , and the law to have its full effect .
The Iowa Senate candidate who charmed the Internet recently with her hog-castration ad—a disturbing metaphor for her claim that she would “cut pork” in Washington—has joined the distinguished club of political aspirants who shoot things they don’t like , on camera .Here’s Joni Ernst at a firing range , taking “aim at wasteful spending” and setting her “sights on Obamacare.”Before Ms. Ernst brought a gun to a political fight , Ron Gould , an Arizona State Senator who ran for Congress in 2012—but didn’t get past the Republican primaries—blew away a copy of the Affordable Care Act .Before that , a man and a young girl in a Herman Cain ad hurled a rabbit out of a catapult and shot it . The rabbit represented the tax code .And before that , Joe Manchin , now the junior senator from West Virginia , killed a cap-and-trade bill .Mr. Manchin won his race . Mr. Cain and Mr. Gould lost theirs . If Ms. Ernst succeeds , she’ll even out the odds for armed politicians in years to come .
A recent paper ( pdf ) by Martin Gilens and Benjamin Page is getting a lot of attention , and deservedly so . Gilens and Page look at a number of issues over the past 30+ years where polling data let us identify public policy preferences , which can be compared with elite and interest-group preferences . And what they find is that politicians don’t seem to care very much about what the public thinks : when elite preferences and popular preferences are different , the elite almost always wins .This is an important insight — and it gains special force these days , when the elite’s views not only favor the elite versus the rest ( duh ) but have also been systematically wrong , on issues from invading Iraq to giving deficits a higher priority than jobs .But there is a danger here of going too far , and imagining that electoral politics is irrelevant . Why bother getting involved in campaigns , when the oligarchy rules whichever party is in power ?So it’s worth pointing out it does make a difference . Yes , Democrats pay a lot of attention to plutocrats , and even make a point of inviting Patrimonial Capitalism : The Next Generation to White House galas ( I would have missed that , even though it’s in my own paper , but for Kathleen Geier . Thanks ! ) . But it’s quite wrong to say that the parties’ behavior in office is the same . As Floyd Norris points out , Obama has in fact significantly raised taxes on very high incomes , largely through special surcharges included in the Affordable Care Act ; and what the Act does with the extra revenue is expand Medicaid and provide subsidies on the exchanges , both means-tested programs whose beneficiaries tend to be mainly lower-income adults . The net effect will be significant losses for the super-elite — not crippling losses , to be sure , and hardly anything that will affect their elite status — and major gains to tens of millions of less fortunate Americans .If you’re waiting for a revolution , or even a new New Deal , this may seem disappointing . But it matters a lot all the same .
EARLIER this month , the New York State Legislature passed a bill granting nurse practitioners the right to provide primary care without physician oversight . New York joins 16 other states and the District of Columbia in awarding such autonomy . ( Most states still require nurse practitioners to work with physicians under a written practice agreement . ) The bill’s authors contend that mandatory collaboration with a physician “no longer serves a clinical purpose” and reduces much-needed access to primary care .Support for such measures has been widespread . Four years ago the Institute of Medicine called for dropping regulations that prevented nurses from practicing “to the full extent of their education and training.” Last year the president of the American Association of Nurse Practitioners argued that the current diversity of health professionals rendered “hierarchical , physician-centric structures unnecessary.”As a physician , I couldn’t disagree more . Though well intentioned , such proposals underestimate the clinical importance of physicians’ expertise and overestimate the cost-effectiveness of nurse practitioners .The impetus behind the new law , which will take effect next year , is the dire shortage of primary-care physicians . A big reason for this scarcity is money . Primary care pays the least of all the medical specialties , and interest in it is at a record low among medical students and residents . At the same time , as baby boomers are starting to retire and the Affordable Care Act adds millions to the rolls of the newly insured , the need for primary-care physicians is growing .Nurse practitioners have been promoted as a cost-effective way to meet this need . Medicare currently reimburses nurse practitioners only 85 percent of the amount that it reimburses primary-care physicians . Paying less for the same work would appear to be a way to save health care dollars .But are nurse practitioners actually more cost-effective ? There is a dearth of good recent empirical research on this question , but some studies have suggested that the answer is no . Nurse practitioners , though generally praised for being sensitive to patients’ psychological and social concerns , appear to order more diagnostic tests than do their physician counterparts . In one study , published in 1999 in the journal Effective Clinical Practice , primary-care patients assigned to nurse practitioners underwent more ultrasounds , CT scans and M.R.I . scans than did patients assigned to physicians . The nurse practitioners’ patients also had 25 percent more specialty visits and 41 percent more hospital admissions .These differences are costly . According to the study , they “may offset or negate any cost savings achieved by hiring nurse practitioners in place of physicians.”There are many reasons the nurse practitioners may have ordered more tests and expert consultations . But it seems most plausible that they did so to compensate for a lack of training . Nurse practitioners receive approximately 600 hours of clinical instruction during their entire formal education , which is less than physicians receive in just the first year of a three-year medical residency .Medical school graduates , after two years of classroom instruction and two years of clinical training , are not considered fit to practice medicine independently . Yet in New York State next year , nurse practitioners with perhaps even less clinical education will be allowed to do so .This does not seem fair or wise . I don’t want to see a two-tiered system of primary care develop in this country . Though primary care is often focused on relatively straightforward illness prevention and health promotion , there will always be subtleties and complexities that demand a doctor’s judgment .When I was doing my internship , 15 years ago , a fellow intern told me about a patient she had seen in the clinic whose voice was hoarse . She had no idea what was wrong with him , but her primary-care instructor , on a routine pass by , immediately diagnosed goiter , an enlargement of the thyroid gland . “You have to know too much to do primary care , ” she concluded . ( She ended up specializing in cardiology . )Primary care , though often routine , is also about finding the extraordinary in what may appear to be routine . As a doctor recently wrote on Sermo , a physician online community , “It’s the ability to differentiate those pale shades of gray in patient care that counts.” To do so consistently , I believe , requires a doctor’s expertise .So if we want more primary-care providers , let’s have them be doctors . And to attract more of the best and brightest in our medical schools , let’s find a way to increase their pay . There is an essential place for nurse practitioners in medicine , but it is as part of a physician-led team . Nurse practitioners are worthy professionals and are absolutely essential to patient care . But they are not doctors .
The current state of public opinion on health reform is really peculiar . If you’ve been following the issue at all closely , you know that the Affordable Care Act is one of the great comeback stories of public policy : after a terrible start , it has dramatically exceeded expectations . But hardly anyone seems to know that .It’s easy to understand how that happens for Fox-watchers and Rush-listeners , who are fed a steady diet of supposed Obamacare disaster stories . Remember this ?But the real story hasn’t even gotten through to many people who should know better .Over the weekend I had dinner in NYC with some very smart , sophisticated people ; yes , all of them liberals . And almost everyone in the group was under the impression that Obamacare is still going badly — they wanted me to tell them whether it could still be turned around .Meanwhile , New York ( which created its own exchange ) is a huge success story : enrollment is 60 percent higher than federal projections , premiums have been cut in half .An aside : New York was already a community-rating state , where insurers weren’t allowed to discriminate based on medical history . But the result of that system was that healthy people tended to stay out of the individual market , creating a bad risk pool that drove up rates . Now everyone has to be in , dramatically improving the risk pool . As such , the New York experiences demonstrates the essential role of the individual mandate for reform .But anyway , back to the mystery : here we have smart , pro-reform people living in a state where reform is going really well . And they don’t know it !In part this may reflect the Obama administration’s lackluster job so far in getting the word out . But it also , I think , reflects a persistent anti-ACA tilt in news coverage . In the final days of March I wrote about the de facto blackout on the obvious surge in enrollments ; if you weren’t reading Charles Gaba and/or bloggers who followed him , you were in the dark about a huge developing story . And this tilt has continued .Just FYI : the article I linked above , about the spectacular success of New York reform , was on page A16 …
If you’ve been tracking the news on signups under the Affordable Care Act – which is easy thanks to Charles Gaba’s invaluable site – you already knew that the program was making a pretty good recovery from the botched start . Now , however , it’s official : as of the end of January signups were only about a million behind their projected track as of last spring , which means that as of March 31 the total is likely to be 6-point-something million rather than the projected 7 million . In other words , basically OK .But here’s the thing : every online article I’ve seen about the latest numbers is followed by a huge number of vitriolic comments insisting that it isn’t true , that Obamacare is a total disaster . Some commenters declare that all the numbers are lies ; others , getting their take from right-wing bloggers , say that all of those who have signed up but not yet paid their first premium – ahem , 47 percent of the total – will never pay and are fake enrollees . And so on .You can’t help but notice the resemblance to the “unskewing” fever of the final weeks of the 2012 election , when everyone on the right knew , just knew , that the polls showing a clear Obama edge were biased and wrong , and that if you reworked the numbers somehow they pointed to a Romney triumph .Now , you might ask , how do I know that the Obamacare unskewers are wrong ? Actually , I don’t know that for sure – but it’s very unlikely that they’re right . For one thing , they are more or less the same as the poll unskewers – people who know nothing about the subject , but know what they want to believe . For another , CBO – which has a reputation to defend – thinks it’s going to be OK . Finally , the insurers , who have real money on the line , seem fairly calm , which wouldn’t be the case if they saw really terrible enrollment .Two things are interesting about all of this . First , the right has evidently learned nothing from the unskewing debacle . And second , right-wingers are totally vested in the idea of an Obamacare collapse . They have no plan B , and their only answer to growing evidence that it’s not going to happen is furious denial .
The good news for Obamacare just keeps coming in . Via Charles Gaba , the Rand Survey — which was the subject of a report in the LA Times , but which wasn’t publicly available — is now in . And it says that as of mid-March — that is , before the final enrollment surge — the Affordable Care Act had already produced a net gain of 9.3 million insured adults . Again , that’s a net gain ; so much for claims that more people are losing insurance than gaining it .At least some Republicans are realizing that ( a ) the ACA is not going to collapse and ( b ) they can’t simply take away insurance from millions of Americans . So they have to come up with an alternative .And as Sahil Kapur reports , at least a few of them are coming to a terrible realization : there is no alternative . You can’t just support the popular pieces of reform , in particular coverage for preexisting conditions , and scrap the rest . As Jonathan Gruber taught me , and I and others have said many times , reform is a three-legged stool that requires community rating , the individual mandate , and subsidies ; take away any leg and it collapses . And Kapur finds a GOP aide who admits to the awful truth : any workable GOP plan would look pretty much the same as Obamacare .I don’t know how many GOP leaders , as opposed to aides , understand this . And even those who do won’t dare to admit it . The party line , literally , has been that Obamacare is an unworkable monstrosity , and the base will destroy anyone who points out , this late in the game , that it’s both workable and pretty much the only doable alternative to single-payer .And if that’s not a case of politics making people stupid , I don’t know what is..
LAST week U.S. News and World Report released its annual list of âBest Hospitals.â Web sites are being updated to celebrate victories . ( Johns Hopkins ranks No . 1 ! ) Magazines will be plump with advertising . ( NewYork-Presbyterian is first in New York and tied for seventh nationally ! ) And , because I am a reporter covering health care , my in-box is accumulating e-mails from the âHonor Rollâ of the Top 18 hospitals .But what does this annual exercise mean for patients ? And what does it say about American health care ?After all , Harvard and Princeton , which tied for No . 1 in the magazineâs 2013 Top 10 national universities list , didnât take out ads to proclaim their triumph ; they will fill their classrooms no matter . And as in the college ratings , there are no big surprises in the top hospital group : they are the big academic medical centers â the Mayo Clinic , Massachusetts General Hospital , the Cleveland Clinic . More to the point , even though you might well fly across the country for four years of schooling , you are far more likely to stay near your home for medical care.Â No oneâs flying to Mayo in Minnesota to get inhalers for asthma , even though it ranks No . 1 for pulmonary medicine .But American hospitals are a bit like restaurants , competing for your business ( and donations ) . As such they go all out to promote their brand , even though hospitals and doctors are not permitted to advertise in many other countries .For American hospitals large and small , it clearly pays to advertise , particularly in these tough economic times and with the Affordable Care Act poised to throw tens of millions of newly insured patients into the market . But for patients the rankings and , especially , the subsequent promotions generally have limited benefit , experts say .âNearly every hospital has a banner out front saying theyâre a âtop hospitalâ for something in some rating system , â said Dr. Nicholas Osborne , a Robert Wood Johnson Clinical Scholar at the University of Michigan . âThose ratings have become more important for hospital marketing than for actually helping patients find the best care.âWhatâs more , Dr. Osborne compared the outcomes of two ranking programs â one by U.S. News and World Report and the other by Healthgrades â and found a âlarge discordanceâ in their results . âThe two biggest rating systems come up with completely different lists , â he said . âWhat does that tell you ? âIf such advertising often adds little in the way of useful information , it certainly adds to health care costs . Hospitals with more than 400 beds spent an average of $ 2.18 million on advertising in 2010 , surveys have found .âWeâre pushing $ 3 trillion in health expenditures , and one-third of that is waste , â said Dr. Eric Topol , chief academic officer at Scripps Health in California . âThose TV commercials saying âI got my cancer care at X hospitalâ are a shame , definitely wasteful.âTo be fair , U.S. News cautions that its national ratings reflect how hospitals perform in treating âtechnically challengingâ cases and that the list is merely a starting point after which âpatients have to do their own research.âBut those caveats are lost in the subsequent barrage of advertising . And the magazine encourages hospitals to post its seal of approval . In return , the U.S. News Web site is bursting with hospital advertising .Some critics decry the glut of hospital self-promotion as not just wasteful and costly , but also potentially dangerous .âThere are general fraud laws , but there is no law specific to hospital advertising , and there should be , â said Robert Steinbuch , a professor of law at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock , who studies the topic . âI canât tell you how many hospitals say , âWe have state-of-the-art CAT scannersâ â there is no such thing ! Itâs an old technology.âIN a country where numerous organizations â including Yelp â accredit , rate and rank hospital care , some accolades may indicate excellence and some donât mean that much at all , he added . And while teams of academics and scores of for-profit companies are developing âqualityâ metrics to guide health care reform and to help patients shop for their care , it turns out that rating a hospital accurately is extremely complicated . For one thing , hospitals that take on sicker patients might have more complications after surgery .Yet even smaller hospitals tend to advertise their profit-making departments , like cardiology , even though they may not offer the full range of heart services .âIf they advertise cardiac care and donât have angioplasty , thatâs essentially fraud , â Mr. Steinbuch said , adding that if a patient dies , âthat could be considered criminally negligent homicide.âBut health care advertising is probably here to stay . âHospital advertising sets up an arms war , so that hospitals feel they canât survive without aggressive marketing , â said Dr. Topol of Scripps Health .And even skeptics concede that health care ratings , when properly developed and employed , may help hospitals improve their performance and provide patients with valuable information .If you have a rare lung condition that has flummoxed local doctors , for example , you may want to fly to Mayo since U.S. News has ranked it No . 1 in pulmonary medicine . And if a dozen hospitals in your area offer hip replacements , a search of regional rankings on the magazineâs Web site will yield some useful statistics . But take all those hospital advertisements with a grain of salt .Indeed , with thousands of good hospitals across the nation , the best selling point for routine medical care may simply be convenience : some studies show that patients prefer nearby hospitals with worse results over ones with better outcomes farther away .
Jonathan Gruber is mad as hell , and he’s not going to take it anymore . The eminent health care economist and health reform architect is annoyed at Casey Mulligan’s latest , which misrepresents Gruber’s views ; mine too .Gruber is right to be mad : that was a disgraceful , deceptive column . But I think you also want to put it into a larger picture : the enduring myth of the stupid progressive economist .So about Mulligan : As Gruber documents , he pulls multiple fast ones , asserting things that he says are conclusions of the CBO report when they aren’t — they’re his own views , pulled out of , um , thin air , or maybe someplace else , which he is projecting onto the budget office to make them seem authoritative .Beyond that , Mulligan tells his readers that both Gruber and I are too dumb or craven to admit that the disincentives to work created by some aspects of the Affordable Care Act impose economic costs . One suspects that Mulligan didn’t actually read either of the pieces he links to . If he had , he would have found this from Gruber:But the likelihood of voluntary reductions in work is not the only issue . The CBO also projects work reduction by individuals who cut back on hours or avoid moving up the job ladder because they don’t want to lose Medicaid eligibility , or because they don’t want to make so much in wages that they would lose tax credits to help pay insurance premiums . Unlike voluntary job leaving , this second kind of work reduction would entail real economic distortions and be a cost , not a benefit .And this from me:Just to be clear , the predicted long-run fall in working hours isn’t entirely a good thing . Workers who choose to spend more time with their families will gain , but they’ll also impose some burden on the rest of society , for example , by paying less in payroll and income taxes . So there is some cost to Obamacare over and above the insurance subsidies . Any attempt to do the math , however , suggests that we’re talking about fairly minor costs , not the “devastating effects” Mr. Cantor asserted in his next post on Twitter .So both of us acknowledge that there are incentive effects and that they have a cost ; but both of us argue on quantitative grounds that the cost isn’t large . Hardly the doctrinaire liberalism Mulligan thinks he sees .Oh , and bonus misrepresentation : Mulligan:Paul Krugman goes even further and calls it “misrepresentations” to interpret the marginal tax rate provisions of the Affordable Care Act as destructive .No , I didn’t — I called talk about “2 million jobs destroyed” a misrepresentation , because it is . Who says so ? The CBO itself .On to the broader point . What one sees in this particular Mulligan piece is something I encounter all the time , in many contexts : the myth of the stupid progressive economist .It works like this : Conservatives in general , and conservative economists in particular , often have a very narrow vision of what economics is all about — namely supply , demand , and incentives . Anything that interferes with the sacred functioning of markets or reduces the incentive to produce must be a bad thing ; any time a progressive economist supports policies that don’t fit neatly into this orthodoxy , it must be because he doesn’t understand Econ 101 . And conservative economists are so sure of this that they can’t be bothered to actually read what the progressives write — at the first hint of deviation from laissez-faire , they stop paying attention and begin debating with the stupid progressive in their mind , not the real economist out there .As a result , many conservatives seem utterly unable to take on board the notion that people like Jon Gruber or yours truly might understand Econ 101 , but also believe with good reason that you need to go beyond that point .On the health care issue : yes , there are incentive effects — as there are with all insurance , by the way . But there’s also good reason to believe that there’s a major market imperfection in the form of job lock , and that even aside from this , there are important benefits to expanding health insurance that must be weighed against any costs . All of that is , in brief , in both of the pieces Mulligan denounces , and there at much greater length in our other writings ; but as so often happens , conservatives develop problems of reading comprehension whenever such issues come up .I’ve encountered similar responses on many other issues . You say that deficit spending is helpful in a depressed economy ? You must be saying that deficits and bigger government are always good , which is stupid hahaha . You say that increasing unemployment benefits in a demand-constrained economy can create jobs ? But you also said once upon a time that unemployment insurance can raise the natural rate of unemployment , so you’re stupid hahaha .Well , somebody’s being stupid , anyway .I can’t resist going back to the 2009 debate over stimulus , when one after another , prominent conservative economists dismissed calls for a temporary increase in spending as being clearly stupid and/or corrupt , because accounting identities , or maybe the effect of expected future taxes , clearly showed that stimulus made no sense . Along the way these notables reinvented classic conceptual errors from 80 years ago and added a few new howlers too ; yet their faith in the proposition that progressive economists must be idiots never wavered .But then John Stuart Mill knew all about this .
Senator Mitch McConnell gave the country a glimpse this week of what Republican control of the Senate would look like . If it produces a familiar depression , it’s because we’ve seen what happens when Republican leaders in the House have used the identical tactics , and most people have little interest in seeing Washington return to battle stations .In an interview with Politico , Mr. McConnell , the minority leader , promised to govern through extortion if his party picks up enough seats in November to make him the majority leader come January . He plans to attach provisions to must-pass spending bills that would roll back the administration’s policies , and dare President Obama to veto them . “We’re going to pass spending bills , and they’re going to have a lot of restrictions on the activities of the bureaucracy , ” Mr. McConnell said . “That’s something he won’t like , but that will be done . I guarantee it.”When a spending bill is vetoed , the resulting impasse leads to a shutdown of the affected departments . If no spending bills can pass , the result is a government shutdown like the one that lasted for 16 days last October , after the House tried to dismantle the Affordable Care Act .No one expected Congress to get much done during Mr. Obama’s final years , but Mr. McConnell apparently intends to escalate the level of confrontation . By promising to resort once again to the use of extortion — and presumably that would extend to raising the debt ceiling — Mr. McConnell demonstrates that his party lacks positive ideas , and is beholden to its most reactionary elements . Many Republican leaders , including Mr. McConnell himself , seemed to have learned how unpopular the shutdown technique was , and had vowed not to use it again . But the party’s base , as best embodied by Senator Ted Cruz of Texas , has become addicted to the very act of confrontation , and wants to engage in showdowns whether or not they are fruitful in political or policy terms .Mr. McConnell , the opposite of a firebrand , needs those kinds of voters in Kentucky to survive his current challenge from the Democrat in his race , Alison Lundergan Grimes . That’s probably why the example he gave in his interview was to add restrictions to the Environmental Protection Agency , which has become unpopular among some voters in the state because of its proposed limits to coal-plant emissions .Even if it’s just a veneer of toughness for campaign purposes , it’s the wrong kind of message to send to voters who are weary of seeing Washington on the brink . It raises expectations among extremists , and will embolden other candidates to make the worst kinds of threats . It also sends a clear message to Democratic voters who are thinking of sitting November out . The midterms matter a great deal .
President Obama was generous on Thursday in referring to Speaker John Boehner’s proposed lawsuit against him as a “stunt , ” a word generally used to mean a playful attempt to get attention . In fact , the suit is a mean-spirited attempt to deflect attention — specifically from the House’s refusal to engage in the act of governing .For the foreseeable future , there will be no action to boost the economy , or help minimum-wage workers , or extend unemployment insurance , or address climate change . Immigration reform is dead . The most basic appropriations bills are likely to get bogged down in Republican attempts to promote coal burning and rein in the Clean Water Act . There is already talk of another in an endless series of stopgap spending bills , the surest sign of a non-functioning Congress . And the Tea Party would love nothing more than another shutdown fight or even impeachment hearings . Mr. Boehner’s lawsuit , which he said will challenge the president’s use of executive authority , was designed in part to appease the far-right corner . But more substantively , it is part of Mr. Boehner’s long-running strategy to pretend there is a legitimate reason for the years of obstruction .He can’t very well explain to the public that the real reason there has been no action on immigration reform is because large swaths of the Republican base dislike Hispanic immigrants . And so he had to construct a way to blame Mr. Obama for the inaction .“Speaker Boehner has been very clear about this : He wants to fix America’s broken immigration system , ” his spokesman , Michael Steel , said last month . “But no one trusts the White House to enforce the law as written.” He can’t be trusted because he allowed the children of immigrants who came to this country illegally to remain without fear of deportation , an executive action that may be on the list of particulars in the lawsuit . ( Mr. Boehner hasn’t said which actions prompted him to sue . )Coal-state lawmakers can’t admit they would rather foul the air than hurt the short-term interests of their states’ biggest industries and employers , so they pretend they are angry about a procedural matter : Mr. Obama’s “overreach” in directing environmental regulators to enforce carbon standards without the permission of Congress .And Republicans care not in the least about the substance of the administration’s actions in delaying parts of the Affordable Care Act ; instead they see each administrative action as an opportunity to portray the president as tyrannical . “We didn’t elect a monarch or a king , ” Mr. Boehner told the House in a letter on Wednesday outlining his legal plans .Royalty is a laughable way to describe a president who had to struggle to get his own aides confirmed by the Senate , and was forced to use an experimental legal maneuver to keep entire agencies functioning . Mr. Obama’s attempt to use recess appointments to get around the Republican refusal to confirm any members to the National Labor Relations Board , regardless of qualification , was slapped back by the Supreme Court on Thursday . Republicans immediately claimed the court , too , has become angered by the president’s imperialism , refusing to acknowledge the president had acted out of desperation to get around their own unprecedented level of resistance .Mr. Boehner’s diversion is the ultimate in frivolous lawsuits — a subject he knows well , since he frequently applies the word “frivolous” to the lawsuits he doesn’t like , including those fighting discrimination against gays and lesbians in the workplace . But it is likely to fail in both its legal objective and its larger purpose . Americans are pretty good at detecting phony excuses to get out of work .
CHARLOTTESVILLE , Va .BOTH liberals and conservatives have the American Constitution in the cross hairs . They assault the Constitution in their different ways , each with damaging effects on our nation . Conservatives attack the courts on one hand and seek to have them advance their activist agenda on the other . Liberals , when it suits them , embrace rights that have not been enumerated in the Constitution and cry for restraint only when their pet bills come under fire . The result is a national jurisprudence whetted by political appetite , with our democratic values as the victims .Conservatives increasingly bemoan Congressâs power to regulate interstate commerce , as illustrated by the debate over the Affordable Care Actâs requirement that individuals buy health insurance . They argue that Congress can only regulate activity , not inactivity , and so when it gets involved in a decision by a consumer to not purchase health care , it is going far beyond its reach .If only it were that simple .As a political argument , that resonates : âDonât Tread On Meâ trumpets the imperishable spirit of American liberty . But as a constitutional argument , it would imbue judges with unprecedented powers to topple an exhaustively debated and duly enacted federal law and to make the determination that the decision not to buy ice cream can be neatly severed from the decision to buy chocolate or vanilla .In curbing federal excess , courts risk lessening our national economic strength . That strength resides partly in the national aspects of our founding document , among them the now maligned commerce clause and the newly mistrusted supremacy clause , which gives preference to federal over state law when there is a conflict . Statesâ rights are important in many spheres , but the benefits of a national economic policy must also be considered . A vibrant economic order requires some political predictability , and the prospect of judgesâ striking down commercial regulation on ill-defined and subjective bases is a prescription for economic chaos that the framers , in a simpler time , had the good sense to head off .It is tempting to shout statesâ rights when deeply flawed federal legislation is enacted , but the momentary satisfactions of that exercise carry long-term constitutional costs . Badly conceived bills die a thousand political deaths â in the appropriations process , in the states , through electoral retribution , in the executive appointments of a succeeding administration and ultimately in amendment and repeal . However , if courts read the Constitution in such a way that it enables them to make Congress ineffectual , and instead to promote 50 state regulatory regimes in an era of rapidly mounting global challenges , the risks should escape no one . Making our charter more parochial while other nations flex their economic muscle seems like poor timing .Liberals are mounting their own , equally damaging , assault on the Constitution . They have forsaken the textual and historical foundations of that document in favor of judicially decreed rights of autonomy . It is one thing to value those rights our cherished Bill of Rights sets forth . But to create rights from whole cloth is to turn oneâs back on law .Just like the opponents of the Affordable Care Act , the proponents of reproductive choice and same-sex marriage have strong arguments â but they are political , not constitutional . What are the consequences when liberals shortchange democratic liberty in favor of judicial expansion of unenumerated personal rights ? Well , for one , creating constitutional rights without foundation frays the community fabric and , with it , the very notion that the majority can enact into law some expression of shared values that make ours a society whose whole is more than the sum of its parts . In pushing a constitutional vision of autonomous individuals divested of location in larger social settings , liberals risk weakening the communal values and institutions that best afford our most disadvantaged the chance for a good life .At a time of dismay over democratic dysfunction , the temptation to ask courts to supplant self-governance runs high . And yet when I look past the present debacle , and think of where democracy has brought this country , I would not lose faith .The risks of continuing our present constitutional course are grave . One faction risks damage to the nation at large , the other to the vital roles of smaller communities . All factions owe their fellow citizens the hope and the prospect of democratic change , not the message that their views have been constitutionally condemned and their opponentsâ views carved in the stone of our founding charter . Restraint has much to commend it as a judicial value , not least of which is that it extends the hand of tolerance and respect to those whose views we may not share , but whose citizenship we do share and whose love of family , community and country burns no less brightly than our own .
The Missouri legislature had no trouble passing a big tax cut today over the veto of Gov . Jay Nixon . As a Missouri native , I’m probably more irritated by this than most Times readers are , but my state is only one of many that have been sharply pulled to the right in the last few years . What’s happening in Jefferson City is already familiar to residents of Wisconsin , Michigan , Kansas , North Carolina , and many others .The main difference is that Mr. Nixon is a Democrat , a relic of the days when his party dominated the state . But Republican leaders are working on that . Last month , they had a serious debate in the House on whether the governor should be impeached for allowing same-sex married couples to file joint tax returns . Gay and lesbian people can’t get married to each other in Missouri , which has a constitutional amendment prohibiting it , but Mr. Nixon had the temerity to allow the joint returns for couples married elsewhere . “This is such a blatant and serious violation of Missouri’s constitution and Missouri law that the governor should be removed from office , ” said Nick Marshall , a state representative from Parkville .In case that didn’t work , there was another impeachment resolution filed that would have ousted Mr. Nixon for failing to properly discipline state workers who released a list of concealed gun permits to the federal government . The resolution began , “Whereas , the people of the State of Missouri cherish their right to bear arms…” and went downhill from there .A few weeks ago , the legislature approved a measure that would nullify all federal gun laws and allow residents to sue federal agents for enforcing them . It carries no legal weight , and Mr. Nixon vetoed something similar last year , but the true believers apparently feel the need to re-establish their credentials repeatedly .Although the impeachment efforts were dropped today , Republicans have managed to push through their agenda . As a Kansas City Star editorial noted , today’s tax cut doesn’t even benefit the people who could use the money the most . A family making $ 44,000 a year will get a $ 32 break , while one making $ 1 million will get $ 7,800 . Most of the benefits , in fact , go to one special-interest group .“It is a gift to businesses whose owners declare their business incomes on their personal tax forms , ” the Star wrote . “Up to one-fourth of their income could eventually be tax-free if the bill becomes law , whether or not they create jobs.”Naturally , Missouri isn’t coming close to fully funding its public school and university system , and is one of 20 states that refuses to expand Medicaid , turning down $ 2.2 billion from the federal government because that would mean accepting the reality of the Affordable Care Act . But when businesses raise their voices for a tax cut , they are answered .It’s not the state I grew up in , which is exactly the way a new generation of leaders like it .
Every year or so Paul Ryan comes up with a glossy new plan to deal with poverty or spending on social programs . The plans never go anywhere , but they’re not really intended to : They’re designed to make the Republican Party ( and Mr. Ryan himself ) appear more thoughtful than it actually is on these subjects .The one he released today is somewhat better than previous efforts , in that it doesn’t propose massive cuts in overall spending ( unlike his House budgets ) , and would even increase the Earned Income Tax Credit , one of the government’s most successful anti-poverty programs . Democrats have also embraced a larger credit , although unlike Mr. Ryan , they would pay for it by raising taxes on the rich rather than slashing federal nutrition programs that Mr. Ryan thinks are a waste of money . But the lack of seriousness in the plan is demonstrated by its supposedly big idea : It would combine 11 of the most important federal poverty programs into something called an “opportunity grant” that would be given to the states to spend as they see fit . The eliminated programs would include food stamps , what remains of the welfare system ( known as Temporary Assistance to Needy Families ) , Section 8 housing vouchers , and low-income heating assistance , among others .This technique should sound familiar . Members of Mr. Ryan’s party have spent years promoting the idea that states can do things better than Washington . As Rick Santorum repeated endlessly in 2012 , “Cap it , cut it , freeze it , and block-grant it to the states.” Mr. Ryan’s running mate that year , Mitt Romney , would have turned all of Medicaid into a block grant system dumped onto the steps of 50 state capitols .Putting programs like food stamps into a block grant means they could not be expanded on a national basis during economic emergencies , when unemployment or poverty soars . If a state were to have a budget crisis , perhaps due to tax cuts , social spending would be the first to go .The broader problem is the sharp division between the states , which exposes the gap between Mr. Ryan’s attempt at high-mindedness and the petty grievances of the Republican majority . The proponents of these consolidation ideas know that while blue states would shoulder their responsibilities and protect their poorest residents , many red states would not . If Washington were not in the anti-poverty business , Republicans would have an opportunity to reduce spending on social programs in about half the country .The attitude of red states toward social spending has been made brutally clear by their reaction to the Affordable Care Act . In 36 states , lawmakers refused to set up health care exchanges , putting the insurance subsidies for poor people at risk if a recent court decision is upheld . And only 27 states , including the District of Columbia , have agreed to expand their Medicaid programs . The effect on lowering the number of uninsured people in states with expanded programs is clear , but lawmakers elsewhere don’t care .In Florida , the Republicans who rule the state have not created exchanges or expanded Medicaid , and have offered nothing to the 760,000 state residents with no insurance . The state has even banned volunteers who were helping poor people sign up for the federal exchange . The president of the Florida Senate , Don Gaetz , summed up the prevailing attitude perfectly this week : “As long as I serve in the Senate , I will never support the state of Florida serving as the instrument by which individuals and businesses are forced into a federal mandate to purchase a health insurance product they may not want.”Mr. Ryan would never say so , but the real effect of his plan is to turn over a series of highly successful federal poverty programs into the hands of Don Gaetz and other anti-government ideologues . There’s not much doubt what the effect on poor people would be .
Much to the chagrin of women’s rights advocates , Hobby Lobby has won its legal battle — but claims of “victory” for religious freedom must be emended . Make no mistake : This is no victory for the freedom to exercise Christian principles . Though employers like Hobby Lobby are now free to deny women access to contraceptives through their employer-subsidized health plans on the basis of religious objection , they will be violating their own purported Christian principles if they do . While Christians are not compelled by their faith to engage in religious practices that impose upon the freedoms of others , they are compelled — by their belief that all persons , men and women , are created in the image of God — to oppose discrimination .Some corporations that have objected to the contraceptive requirements of the Affordable Care Act , like Hobby Lobby , claim that they do not wish to discriminate against women by denying them access to contraceptives generally , and that their opposition is merely to abortion . However , their understanding of which medications act as abortifacients rests on an outdated understanding of medical science and is at odds with the facts of the matter . Use of these contraceptive methods is not tantamount to abortion , and moreover , providing women with access to safe , reliable contraceptives for free drastically reduces the actual abortion rate .It is likely that women will ultimately retain coverage , anyhow , though religious employers are now able to legally withhold it . The Supreme Court assumed in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby that the government has a compelling interest in ensuring that women have full access to preventive care . It appears that a majority of the court believes that this interest is compelling . The issue still under real legal dispute is how that coverage will be provided .One suggestion is that the Obama administration extend to closely held , for-profit corporations the same accommodation already in place for religiously affiliated nonprofits . If a corporation objects , on religious grounds , to covering contraceptives in its health plan , it can fill out a two-page form , with five questions ( two of which are providing a signature and the date ) , self-certifying that it meets the requirements for religious accommodation . By submitting this form , employees will be provided contraceptive coverage directly from their insurance company rather than through their employer .This very exemption , however , currently faces its own legal threat from some Christian religious organizations , which claim that notifying the government of their objections to contraceptive use is itself religiously objectionable , as doing so will “trigger” the provision of coverage by a third party . The University of Notre Dame and Wheaton College are among several institutions that have brought such challenges . There is very little sense to be made of claims that your freedom of religion is substantially burdened by someone else’s providing services that you do not want to provide yourself . This suggests that the legal challenges are not merely aimed at allowing corporations to abstain from facilitating behavior they deem immoral but instead are seeking to effectively prevent women from engaging in that “immoral” behavior by keeping financial barriers for women , and administrative barriers for the government , in place .This is economic coercion . Opponents to the contraceptive mandate have insisted that women remain free to purchase whatever health care services they choose , but this is woefully insensitive to the reality that low-income women and families face . For these women , there is a very large difference between what is available to them for purchase in principle and in effect . It is easy for those who do not regularly face desperate decisions due to financial insecurity or medical complexities to forget the difference . An intrauterine device , for example , can cost a low-income full-time worker more than a month’s wages . For some women , this is both the safest and most effective medical option , yet hopelessly unaffordable .This kind of economic coercion is distinctly at odds with Christian principles . There is only one incident described in the Christian scriptures where Jesus is represented as employing coercive force , and it was not used to prevent people from engaging in sin . It was used , instead , to prevent people from dishonoring God by exploiting religious practice for personal gain . The gospels describe Jesus’ reaction to those who sought to profit from the Passover pilgrimage to the temple as fierce : “And making a whip of cords , he drove them all out of the temple , with the sheep and oxen . And he poured out the coins of the money-changers and overturned their tables . And he told those who sold the pigeons , ‘Take these things away ; do not make my Father’s house a house of trade.’” This is where corporations that claim their operations constitute religious practice of the Christian faith ought to take note .Hobby Lobby offered coverage for some of the contraceptives it now claims its religious faith forbids it to have any association with , until shortly after the Becket Fund for Religious Freedom asked it if it would be interested in filing suit . The company continues to profit from investments in the manufacturers of the “objectionable” contraceptives through the 401 ( k ) plan it offers its employees . Recently , Hobby Lobby has faced legal trouble for false advertising . It has built a fortune , in large part , by selling goods manufactured in China , infamous for its poor labor conditions and related human rights violations . These are the practices of a corporation that will emphasize the Christian faith of its owners when convenient and profitable , but set that faith aside when it would be costly to do otherwise .Hobby Lobby is not the only corporation which has objected to the law through what seems to be quite selective applications of Christian principle . Offering health care coverage as called for by the Affordable Care Act is morally permissible according to the Catholic philosophical tradition , and the sincerity of institutions like the University of Notre Dame is questionable .The more pressing question religious corporations should ask themselves is whether denying women comprehensive health care while providing it to men , and so failing to respect women’s inherent dignity and equality , is consistent with their religious values . Since the Supreme Court focused on the practical effects at stake ( that is , whether women would be able to obtain coverage elsewhere , and thus by a less restrictive means ) rather than on the expressive function of the law , Hobby Lobby is now free to discriminate in its provision of health care . But the question remains , why would it want to ?Kathryn Pogin will enter the graduate program in philosophy at Northwestern University in the fall .
MARRIAGE is disappearing . More than 40 percent of new mothers are unmarried . Many young adults drift into parenthood unintentionally . They may be cohabiting at the time of their child’s birth , but about half of these couples will have split up by the time their child is 5 years old . College-educated young adults are still marrying before having children and planning their families more intentionally . The rest of America , about two-thirds of the population , is not .We’ve been worrying about these trends for years , and wondering : Can marriage be restored as the standard way to raise children ? As much as we might welcome a revival , I doubt that it will happen . The genie is out of the bottle . What we need instead is a new ethic of responsible parenthood . If we combine an updated social norm with greater reliance on the most effective forms of birth control , we can transform drifters into planners and improve children’s life prospects .The drifters need better educational and job opportunities , but unless we come to grips with what is happening to marriage and parenting , progress will be limited . For every child lifted out of poverty by a social program , another one is entering poverty as a result of the continued breakdown of the American family . If we could turn back the marriage clock to 1970 , before the sharp rise in divorce and single parenthood began , the child poverty rate would be 20 percent lower than it is now . Even some of our biggest social programs , like food stamps , do not reduce child poverty as much as unmarried parenthood has increased it .The decline in marriage and the growth of childbearing outside of marriage is partly a result of the limited economic prospects of those at the bottom . We should provide more education and job opportunities for unskilled men in particular , but the evidence that these policies will restore stable families is sketchy . For one thing , although less-educated men are struggling , they still earn more than their female counterparts , and moneywise two incomes in a household are always better than one .Even if economics played a key role initially , it has propelled a huge shift in social norms that is by now deeply embedded in our culture . Not only are single-parent families far more common and socially acceptable than they were in the past , but scholars studying low-income or working-class communities have discovered that the women in these communities no longer think it is realistic to depend on the men in their lives . They have seen or experienced too much divorce , infidelity , substance abuse and other bad behavior to trust or fully rely on their partners .Liberals argue that we should accept the new reality and support single parents by providing more child care , health care , food and cash assistance . These efforts help , but with one-third of all children now living in families like this , and child poverty rates in these families four times as high as they are in two-parent families , this is a hugely expensive proposition . It is also inconsistent with a public ethic that values self-sufficiency over dependency .Conservatives , for their part , believe that the problem is cultural and that restoration of marriage is not only possible but the best route to reducing poverty and inequality . As Senator Marco Rubio , Republican of Florida , put it , “the greatest tool to lift children and families from poverty is one that decreases the probability of child poverty by 82 percent . But it isn’t a government spending program . It’s called marriage.”Conservatives , however , have never explained how to restore marriage . Everything they have tried — from marriage-education programs to changes in the way marriage is treated in tax and benefit programs — has had little or no effect .The debate between these two camps has been going on for a long time with no resolution . I first encountered it when I wrote a book on the growth of single-parent families in the wake of the controversy spawned by the 1965 report by Daniel Patrick Moynihan , which argued that the breakdown of the black family was the cause of most social pathologies in inner city communities . Now single parenthood is as common among whites as it was among blacks in the mid-60s . ( At that time , the proportion of black children living in single-parent families was 22 percent . It has subsequently risen to 72 percent . )I encountered the debate again during the administration of President Bill Clinton when , as an associate director of the Office of Management and Budget and a member of the president’s welfare-reform task force , I heard the argument that providing unconditional assistance to women raising children on their own was a major reason for the proliferation of such families . Although any evidence of such an effect was weak at best , I supported Mr. Clinton’s effort in 1996 to make welfare conditional on work . I hoped this would at least make women think twice before having a child on their own . But the growth of births outside of marriage has continued almost unabated .Not only are 40 percent of all children born outside marriage ( 50 percent among mothers under 30 ) , but 60 percent of these births were unplanned . New parents often come to accept and love the baby , but it is not an auspicious beginning . Research I did with Quentin Karpilow and Joanna Venator at the Brookings Institution shows that unplanned births affect children’s development , including their chances of graduating from college and earning a middle-class income .Such high rates of unplanned pregnancies may seem surprising given the ready availability of many forms of contraception . But it turns out that most people are not very good at using contraception consistently . Condoms , a popular contraceptive choice among young unmarried adults , have especially high failure rates . Among typical users , 63 percent will have experienced a pregnancy at the end of five years ( 40 percent will go on to have an abortion ) .Long-acting reversible contraceptives ( known in the field as LARCs and including implants and IUDs ) , could transform this landscape . The reason for high rates of unplanned pregnancies and births is not that young adults don’t understand that becoming a parent is challenging ; it’s because they , like all of us , are prone to making mistakes and are often ambivalent about their intentions . If these or other new forms of contraception were more accessible and less costly , and if more people understood how effective and convenient they are , unplanned pregnancies would decline .The reason is simple . LARCs change the default from having to do something difficult ( reach for a condom or remember to take a pill every day ) to not having to do anything until one is ready to be a parent . Becoming pregnant requires a very deliberate decision to have the IUD or implant removed . For this reason , IUDs are 17.8 percentage points more effective than condoms and 8.8 percentage points more effective than the pill at preventing pregnancy ( although all of them are far better than using no protection at all , and condoms are still needed to protect against sexually transmitted infections ) . Despite a bad rap based on an earlier history associated with the dangerous Dalkon Shield , LARCs are also safe , according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists .A Washington University study of nearly 10,000 demographically representative women in the St. Louis region found that among those who were offered free contraception along with good counseling about the most effective methods , 75 percent chose a long-acting reversible contraceptive , and there was “an 80 percent reduction in teen births and a 75 percent reduction in abortions among women in the cohort compared to national statistics.” A similar program in Colorado , in which private funding was provided to 28 clinics to offer LARCs at little or no cost to women , also had great success , reducing births to high-risk , mostly poor young women , ages 15 to 24 , by 27 percent between 2009 and 2011 .The upfront cost of this type of contraceptive can be high , as much as $ 1,000 , but over a woman’s reproductive life it is cheaper than the pill . Research by my former Brookings colleagues Adam Thomas and Emily Monea shows that for every dollar invested in birth control , taxpayers save roughly five dollars on Medicaid-supported births and on social welfare payments for the mother and child . If these accidental births could be avoided , these 20-somethings might reach an age at which stable relationships are finally possible , unencumbered by a child from a previous relationship . And whether a woman finds a partner or not , by waiting she would be better prepared to raise a child by herself . Because the conversation has focused so heavily on marriage , we have lost sight of the fact that it is the quality of parenting that really matters , not just the structure of the family .It is in this context that any efforts , like the Supreme Court’s decision in Hobby Lobby to curtail access to the most effective forms of birth control , are misguided . If we could make the most effective forms of birth control available to all women with no co-payment , we would not only have healthier children and lower child poverty rates , we would limit the extent of government assistance people need in the process .The Affordable Care Act required most insurance plans to cover all forms of contraception approved by the Food and Drug Administration , while also expanding Medicaid and community health centers . But the full implementation of these provisions is far from guaranteed . Current court challenges to the contraceptive coverage provision , the unwillingness of some states to expand Medicaid , and a lack of clinics and of doctors knowledgeable about and trained in the provision of LARCs are all impediments to an era of more responsible parenthoodBut greater access to the most effective forms of contraception is not enough . We also need a new ethic of responsible parenthood . That means not having a child before you and your partner really want one and have thought about how you will care for that child . Those from less privileged backgrounds may worry that they will never be able to afford a child . But two full-time $ 10-an-hour jobs bring in roughly $ 40,000 a year , hardly a princely sum yet enough to support a family well above the poverty line , even after child care and other expenses . These families should be receiving child-care subsidies and other forms of help . I can even imagine making certain benefits conditional on greater responsibility on their part , but think that might be too great a threat to individual rights . Softer nudges toward more responsible behavior can work just as well .SOCIAL norms do evolve . Fewer people now smoke and more of them wear seatbelts . Attitudes toward gays and women have shifted dramatically . Teenage pregnancy and birthrates have declined sharply in recent decades , partly because of new media messages ( like the TV show “16 and Pregnant” ) and an emerging consensus that it is simply not a good idea to have a child as a teenager . The problem of unintended births has moved up the age scale ; a similar consensus could eventually emerge here too . Government or foundation-funded social marketing campaigns can change attitudes . Campaigns devoted to reducing teenage smoking and drunken driving have succeeded . The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy ( on whose board I serve ) has pioneered efforts of this kind to reduce pregnancy .We need more ( and better quality ) child care and a higher minimum wage , as well as serious education and training for those who are struggling to care for their families . But government alone can’t solve this problem . Younger people must begin to take greater responsibility for their choices . The old social norm was , “Don’t have a child outside of marriage.” The new norm needs to be , “Don’t have a child until you and your partner are ready to be parents.” Whether or not it was a realistic norm in the past , it is now — precisely because newer forms of contraception make planning a family so much easier .Well-functioning democracies are built on the premise that government has an obligation to promote the general welfare . But so do citizens . More support for those who are drifting is in order , but less drifting is also essential .
WASHINGTON — FOR years , particularly after the 2000 election , talk about the Supreme Court has centered on its bitter 5-to-4 divisions . Yet it is worth reflecting on a remarkable achievement : The court has agreed unanimously in more than 66 percent of its cases this term ( and that figure holds even if Monday’s remaining two cases , on the Affordable Care Act’s contraceptive coverage and on public-sector unions , are not unanimous ) . The last year this happened was 1940 .The justices’ ability to cross partisan divides and find common ground in their bottom-line judgment in roughly two-thirds of their cases — including the two decisions handed down Thursday , restricting the president’s ability to issue recess appointments during brief breaks in the Senate’s work , and striking down a Massachusetts ban on protests near abortion clinics — should remind us that even in this hyperpartisan age , there is a difference between law and politics .Unanimity is important because it signals that the justices can rise above their differences and interpret the law without partisanship . The best illustration of this in the modern era is Brown v. Board of Education , in which the court unanimously declared racial segregation in education to be unconstitutional . When the justices forge common ground , it signals to the nation the deep-seated roots of what the court has said and contributes to stability in the fabric of the law .The court has not always valued consensus so highly . At the nation’s founding , the justices each wrote separate opinions — leaving lawyers , and indeed the nation , to guess what the court was actually saying as a whole . It took Chief Justice John Marshall’s leadership , at the start of the 19th century , to bring the court together and to establish the practice of writing a single opinion for the court . Marshall was not above using hard and soft persuasion , going so far as to invite his colleagues to live together in a Washington boardinghouse , where they bonded and discussed cases over Madeira . Disagreement on the court in that century was rare , with dissents occurring only roughly 10 percent of the time . Chief Justice William H. Taft , in the first decades of the 20th century , reportedly talked his colleagues out of more than 200 dissenting votes with his formidable political skills .But the modern era has been something of a disaster for unanimity . Chief Justice Earl Warren was able to achieve unanimity only 36.1 percent of the time ; Chief Justice Warren E. Burger , a scant 35.8 percent . One of Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist’s final public acts was to express exasperation at the fractured court . In 2005 , on the final day of his final term , a frail Rehnquist described his last majority opinion by first outlining his views , then the three concurrences filed , and then the three dissents filed , and joking , “I didn’t know we had that many people on our court.” Compare that talk , and those numbers , to what Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. achieved this year with his colleagues .People remember Chief Justice Roberts’s 2005 confirmation hearing for his statement that his job would be to call balls and strikes . But something else he said is worth remembering : that he would try to bring about “a greater degree of coherence and consensus in the opinions of the court.” He pointed to Warren’s leadership in Brown as an example .Unanimity , of course , would mean little if it were reserved only for minor things . But the court was unanimous this term in cases that posed big central questions , like whether the government could search your cellphone without a warrant , whether software could be patented , whether the rules for class-action securities lawsuits should change , and many others . Those cases were not easy ones . In the cellphone case , the government made forceful points about the ways in which those searches were permissible , and indeed necessary , for law enforcement . The software industry and its foes argued vociferously about whether software patents were destroying the economy or creating it . And so on . What’s more , the court wasn’t unanimous because the justices sat on their hands ; to the contrary , they reversed the lower court 74 percent of the time this year .Many justices have pointed out the importance of published dissent . There is no doubt that dissents can serve a useful role by explaining when a justice thinks the majority has gone off the deep end . But unanimity also sends its own powerful message — one that might be eclipsed in the headlines by a sensational dissent , but could ultimately have a greater impact . Take the abortion decision on Thursday , which was unanimous in its bottom line , but not in its reasoning . Chief Justice Roberts joined four justices appointed by Democratic presidents — the same lineup that saved the Affordable Care Act two years ago , that time for a liberal result , unlike Thursday’s .This path , of trying to forge places of agreement even among people who are inclined to disagree , is the essence of what the American experiment is all about . In an era when the leadership of the House of Representatives is suing the president , when people across the aisle can not even be in the same room with one another , the modesty and cultivated collegiality of the nine members of the Supreme Court this year remind us all that there is another way .Instead of worrying about balls and strikes , Chief Justice Roberts has shifted his efforts to a new focus : making all nine justices play ball for the same team . The country , and the rule of law , are better off for it .
AN insidious trend has developed over this past third of a century . A country that experienced shared growth after World War II began to tear apart , so much so that when the Great Recession hit in late 2007 , one could no longer ignore the fissures that had come to define the American economic landscape . How did this “shining city on a hill” become the advanced country with the greatest level of inequality ?One stream of the extraordinary discussion set in motion by Thomas Piketty’s timely , important book , “Capital in the Twenty-First Century , ” has settled on the idea that violent extremes of wealth and income are inherent to capitalism . In this scheme , we should view the decades after World War II — a period of rapidly falling inequality — as an aberration .This is actually a superficial reading of Mr. Piketty’s work , which provides an institutional context for understanding the deepening of inequality over time . Unfortunately , that part of his analysis received somewhat less attention than the more fatalistic-seeming aspects .Over the past year and a half , The Great Divide , a series in The New York Times for which I have served as moderator , has also presented a wide range of examples that undermine the notion that there are any truly fundamental laws of capitalism . The dynamics of the imperial capitalism of the 19th century needn’t apply in the democracies of the 21st . We don’t need to have this much inequality in America .Our current brand of capitalism is an ersatz capitalism . For proof of this go back to our response to the Great Recession , where we socialized losses , even as we privatized gains . Perfect competition should drive profits to zero , at least theoretically , but we have monopolies and oligopolies making persistently high profits . C.E.O.s enjoy incomes that are on average 295 times that of the typical worker , a much higher ratio than in the past , without any evidence of a proportionate increase in productivity .If it is not the inexorable laws of economics that have led to America’s great divide , what is it ? The straightforward answer : our policies and our politics . People get tired of hearing about Scandinavian success stories , but the fact of the matter is that Sweden , Finland and Norway have all succeeded in having about as much or faster growth in per capita incomes than the United States and with far greater equality .So why has America chosen these inequality-enhancing policies ? Part of the answer is that as World War II faded into memory , so too did the solidarity it had engendered . As America triumphed in the Cold War , there didn’t seem to be a viable competitor to our economic model . Without this international competition , we no longer had to show that our system could deliver for most of our citizens .Ideology and interests combined nefariously . Some drew the wrong lesson from the collapse of the Soviet system . The pendulum swung from much too much government there to much too little here . Corporate interests argued for getting rid of regulations , even when those regulations had done so much to protect and improve our environment , our safety , our health and the economy itself .But this ideology was hypocritical . The bankers , among the strongest advocates of laissez-faire economics , were only too willing to accept hundreds of billions of dollars from the government in the bailouts that have been a recurring feature of the global economy since the beginning of the Thatcher-Reagan era of “free” markets and deregulation .The American political system is overrun by money . Economic inequality translates into political inequality , and political inequality yields increasing economic inequality . In fact , as he recognizes , Mr. Piketty’s argument rests on the ability of wealth-holders to keep their after-tax rate of return high relative to economic growth . How do they do this ? By designing the rules of the game to ensure this outcome ; that is , through politics .So corporate welfare increases as we curtail welfare for the poor . Congress maintains subsidies for rich farmers as we cut back on nutritional support for the needy . Drug companies have been given hundreds of billions of dollars as we limit Medicaid benefits . The banks that brought on the global financial crisis got billions while a pittance went to the homeowners and victims of the same banks’ predatory lending practices . This last decision was particularly foolish . There were alternatives to throwing money at the banks and hoping it would circulate through increased lending . We could have helped underwater homeowners and the victims of predatory behavior directly . This would not only have helped the economy , it would have put us on the path to robust recovery .OUR divisions are deep . Economic and geographic segregation have immunized those at the top from the problems of those down below . Like the kings of yore , they have come to perceive their privileged positions essentially as a natural right . How else to explain the recent comments of the venture capitalist Tom Perkins , who suggested that criticism of the 1 percent was akin to Nazi fascism , or those coming from the private equity titan Stephen A. Schwarzman , who compared asking financiers to pay taxes at the same rate as those who work for a living to Hitler’s invasion of Poland .Our economy , our democracy and our society have paid for these gross inequities . The true test of an economy is not how much wealth its princes can accumulate in tax havens , but how well off the typical citizen is — even more so in America where our self-image is rooted in our claim to be the great middle-class society . But median incomes are lower than they were a quarter-century ago . Growth has gone to the very , very top , whose share has almost quadrupled since 1980 . Money that was meant to have trickled down has instead evaporated in the balmy climate of the Cayman Islands .With almost a quarter of American children younger than 5 living in poverty , and with America doing so little for its poor , the deprivations of one generation are being visited upon the next . Of course , no country has ever come close to providing complete equality of opportunity . But why is America one of the advanced countries where the life prospects of the young are most sharply determined by the income and education of their parents ?Among the most poignant stories in The Great Divide were those that portrayed the frustrations of the young , who yearn to enter our shrinking middle class . Soaring tuitions and declining incomes have resulted in larger debt burdens . Those with only a high school diploma have seen their incomes decline by 13 percent over the past 35 years .Where justice is concerned , there is also a yawning divide . In the eyes of the rest of the world and a significant part of its own population , mass incarceration has come to define America — a country , it bears repeating , with about 5 percent of the world’s population but around a fourth of the world’s prisoners .Justice has become a commodity , affordable to only a few . While Wall Street executives used their high-retainer lawyers to ensure that their ranks were not held accountable for the misdeeds that the crisis in 2008 so graphically revealed , the banks abused our legal system to foreclose on mortgages and evict people , some of whom did not even owe money .More than a half-century ago , America led the way in advocating for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , adopted by the United Nations in 1948 . Today , access to health care is among the most universally accepted rights , at least in the advanced countries . America , despite the implementation of the Affordable Care Act , is the exception . It has become a country with great divides in access to health care , life expectancy and health status .In the relief that many felt when the Supreme Court did not overturn the Affordable Care Act , the implications of the decision for Medicaid were not fully appreciated . Obamacare’s objective — to ensure that all Americans have access to health care — has been stymied : 24 states have not implemented the expanded Medicaid program , which was the means by which Obamacare was supposed to deliver on its promise to some of the poorest .We need not just a new war on poverty but a war to protect the middle class . Solutions to these problems do not have to be newfangled . Far from it . Making markets act like markets would be a good place to start . We must end the rent-seeking society we have gravitated toward , in which the wealthy obtain profits by manipulating the system .The problem of inequality is not so much a matter of technical economics . It’s really a problem of practical politics . Ensuring that those at the top pay their fair share of taxes — ending the special privileges of speculators , corporations and the rich — is both pragmatic and fair . We are not embracing a politics of envy if we reverse a politics of greed . Inequality is not just about the top marginal tax rate but also about our children’s access to food and the right to justice for all . If we spent more on education , health and infrastructure , we would strengthen our economy , now and in the future . Just because you’ve heard it before doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try it again .We have located the underlying source of the problem : political inequities and policies that have commodified and corrupted our democracy . It is only engaged citizens who can fight to restore a fairer America , and they can do so only if they understand the depths and dimensions of the challenge . It is not too late to restore our position in the world and recapture our sense of who we are as a nation . Widening and deepening inequality is not driven by immutable economic laws , but by laws we have written ourselves .This is the last article in The Great Divide .

PRIVACY . Selfie . Geek . Science . Four dictionary publishers each selected one of those words as its word of the year for 2013 . But itâs tough to catalog the preoccupations of the year in a single word . There were many flying around that seemed to capture a moment , an emotion , a thought , a new way of doing or describing things , or the larger zeitgeist .

WASHINGTON — MORE than two million people have signed up for health insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act , a tribute to the effectiveness of the “tech surge” the Obama administration deployed to overcome the highly publicized problems with HealthCare.gov that emerged in October . The website’s initial rollout will long stand as a monument to how badly technology contracting can go wrong . But the remarkable recovery also demonstrates what a determined response to such bungling can achieve .Sadly , food stamp and Medicaid recipients can only look on in envy . Just as disaster-relief agencies keep track of hurricanes , floods and earthquakes , students of anti-poverty programs remember a litany of automation and contracting meltdowns — some of them prolonged , even epic . Florida , 1992-93 . Michigan , 1998-99 . Colorado , 1998-2002 . Texas , 2006-7 . Indiana , 2007-9 . The Colorado Benefits Management System is particularly memorable : When first implemented , it reportedly refused food stamps to anyone who did not have a driver’s license from Guam .But finding parallels to the HealthCare.gov meltdown requires no memory at all . Just as HealthCare.gov was filling the headlines , a contractor for the Georgia Department of Human Services was neglecting to send renewal notices to the homes of some 66,000 food stamp recipients and about half that number of Medicaid beneficiaries . On Nov. 1 , the state’s computer system — which goes by the Orwellian acronym Success — automatically terminated benefits to all those affected for failure to cooperate with reviews they had never been told were underway .In December , a Massachusetts contractor sent thousands of people new electronic food stamp benefit cards and immediately deactivated their old cards — without waiting to see if the new ones had arrived in the mail . Many had not . In mid-October , a contractor’s glitch made food stamps inaccessible to recipients in 17 states .The White House showed impressive alacrity in fixing HealthCare.gov . But its response to technology failures affecting low-income people has been far more sluggish . The federal Department of Health and Human Services did eventually direct Georgia to reactivate the Medicaid benefits for those wrongfully terminated . The federal Department of Agriculture ( which administers food stamps , now known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program ) brushed aside repeated pleas to tell Georgia to reinstate food assistance in time for Thanksgiving .Instead , Georgia told its desperate people to reapply through a website , though it operated only intermittently . Wrongfully terminated households could call to request paper applications — but the call center answered fewer than 30 percent of the calls it received in September , and the lucky few who did get through had average waiting times of 34 minutes . They could go into a local food stamp office — but once there , they would only be directed to a terminal to try to get on the website or a phone to try to get through to the call center . Not just Orwell , but Kafka and Dickens come to mind .Nor was this latest failure an isolated episode . In July 2012 , a group of Atlanta eligibility workers told the federal Agriculture Department that case managers were “falsely documenting” that they were calling customers and “getting no answer” and using that excuse to justify denial of food-stamp assistance .The Agriculture Department did not investigate these whistle-blowers’ complaints . When my name appeared in an Atlanta news article about the food stamp debacle , a state employee called me to report a backlog of 12,000 applications waiting to be entered into the Success database .All of this reflects a broader double standard for automation and contracting — and for government administration generally . An Indiana state judge described a familiar pattern in an earlier food stamp and Medicaid automation contracting fiasco : Officials implemented a “supersized” contract , an “untested theoretical experiment , ” that resulted in irremediable “personal suffering of needy Hoosiers.”A few years ago , a former federal official , frustrated at frequent indifference to low-income Medicaid beneficiaries , joked darkly that the two big government health insurance programs should be called “Med-I-Care” and “Med-I-Don’t-Care.” ( Elderly Medicare users are politically far more important than the poor and disabled customers of Medicaid . )Properly supervised contractors can use technology to improve the delivery of government services . But attention , oversight and willingness to act decisively to remedy fiascoes seem to depend on the wealth and clout of those who are affected . As Obamacare regains its footing , that lesson shouldn’t be forgotten .
BILTMORE LAKE , N.C. â ON Sept. 11 , anti-gun-control legislators in the Missouri General Assembly are likely to pass a bill , over the governorâs veto , that renders almost all federal gun laws void in the state , and even makes it a crime for federal agents to enforce them .Missouri is only the latest state to push back against federal gun laws . In Montana , the Firearms Freedom Act , passed in 2009 , purports to exempt any gun manufactured and kept within the state from federal regulations ; despite a federal appellate court decision last month invalidating the statute , it has served as a model for new or pending laws in more than a half-dozen states .But while states are not powerless in the face of federal law , there are limits to what they can do to prevent enforcement of constitutionally valid regulation .The bills are based on the theory of nullification , which has its roots in the late 18th and early 19th centuries and holds that the federal government exists by the will of the states , and that states therefore have the right to decide which federal laws are constitutionally valid within their borders .When it comes to gun control , the claims of nullification advocates are threefold : no state is required to enforce federal gun regulations , states may prevent federal officials from enforcing laws declared by the state to be unconstitutional , and some federal gun restrictions are in fact unconstitutional â either because they violate the Second Amendment ( says Missouri ) or are outside the scope of the federal governmentâs power to regulate commerce ( says Montana ) .On the first point , the nullifiers are correct : in a 1997 decision , Printz v. United States , the Supreme Court held that âthe Federal Government may not compel the States to enact or administer a federal regulatory program.â That case involved the Brady Act of 1993 , which established a national system for background checks and commanded state law enforcement officials to conduct them .Of course , background checks are still required in every state . Thatâs because federal officials are authorized to enforce their own laws , even if they can not compel the states to do so . Thus , on the second point , the nullifiers are wrong : states can not impede federal enforcement of a federal law merely because the state deems it unconstitutional . That is up to the federal courts .Yes , state legislatures or governors can assert that a federal law offends the Constitution . But as James Madison wrote in his Report of 1800 , such declarations are âexpressions of opinionâ for âexciting reflection . The expositions of the judiciary , on the other hand , are carried into immediate effect.â In assessing constitutionality , our system of governance recognizes one Supreme Court , not 50 individual states .Strangely , if nullification proponents had their way , Chicagoâs gun ban , which the Supreme Court invalidated in 2010 , might still be in effect . Moreover , if the court had not held in 1960 that nullification âis illegal defiance of constitutional authority , â many public schools might have remained segregated .That brings us to the third point : whether the Constitution holds that federal gun laws are unconstitutional . If it does , then states would be justified in preventing enforcement . But despite pleas from the gun rights community , the Supreme Court has not gone that far .Indeed , when the Court overturned Washingtonâs handgun ban in its 2008 decision in District of Columbia v. Heller â in which I was co-counsel to the plaintiff , Dick Heller â Justice Antonin Scalia , who wrote the majority opinion , was careful to note that the right to keep and bear arms is not absolute .He wrote that his opinion did not âcast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill , or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings , or laws imposing conditions and qualificationsâ â like background checks â âon the commercial sale of arms.âSubsequent cases will determine which regulations are allowable . But until the courts say otherwise , federal gun laws are presumptively consistent with Second Amendment rights .What about Montanaâs argument that federal restrictions on guns made and transported entirely within the state exceed Congressâs power to regulate interstate commerce ? Over protests from some libertarian activists , myself included , the Supreme Court has consistently expanded the federal governmentâs power to regulate commerce to cover any economic act that , in the aggregate , could have a substantial effect on interstate commerce â even if the act is not strictly commercial and is wholly within one state .Meanwhile , nullification battles extend beyond gun laws . Nearly two dozen states have condoned medical marijuana use in defiance of federal restrictions . Washington and Colorado have even legalized recreational marijuana use . At least 23 states have considered bills that nullify the Affordable Care Act of 2010 .I fully support those who see risks in the expansion of federal power , particularly when it comes to intrusions on basic rights like gun ownership . However , to defend those rights , we canât begin by flouting the very document that inspires that fight in the first place : the Constitution .
AS the predominantly black , disproportionately poor community of Ferguson , Mo. , erupted in protest after the shooting death of Michael Brown , critics excoriated President Obama for his failure to empathize . Michael Eric Dyson , for example , called the president’s statement about the case on Monday a “stunning epic failure.”Mr. Obama’s defenders point to his second-term commitment to issues that touch the lives of poor communities of color , especially his initiative to assist young minority men , My Brother’s Keeper . But what both sides are ignoring is the president’s first-term record .A true measure of a president’s priorities lies hidden in plain sight in his budget proposals . Under that standard , Mr. Obama has been more committed to communities like Ferguson than any Democratic president in the past half century .By looking at what percentage of the budget presidents propose to spend to fight poverty , we can compare their degree of commitment .While Mr. Obama advocated for the Affordable Care Act as a way to assist poor African-Americans , for example , we can’t put that on an effort scale and compare it to President Bill Clinton’s advocacy for his health care plan . Our method also avoids the problem of accounting for forces beyond presidents’ control .Using this method , we find that President Obama attempted to deliver far more than his counterparts . The Congressional Budget Office’s inflation-adjusted numbers show that Mr. Obama sought to spend far more on means-tested anti-poverty programs than other first-term Democratic presidents . The targeted needs include food , housing , education , health care and cash .Mr. Obama earmarked 17 percent of his budget for these needs , versus Mr. Clinton’s 12 percent and Jimmy Carter’s 8 percent . These presidents all faced economic challenges , although of different degrees and strength . Each was committed to the needs of the poor and the disadvantaged . But Mr. Obama made good on that commitment far more concretely .No president gets all he requests , but the outcomes speak well for Mr. Obama , too . Christopher Wimer of Columbia University found , for example , that tax and transfer policies lowered the poverty rate by only 1 percentage point in 1967 , under President Lyndon B. Johnson , but by almost 13 points in 2012 .Did Mr. Obama plan to spend more simply because he had more mouths to feed ? No . Even after accounting for the higher numbers of poor people caught in the Great Recession , Mr. Obama’s record outshines his predecessors’ . His proposed first-term spending per poor individual was $ 13,731 to Mr. Clinton’s $ 8,310 and Mr. Carter’s $ 4,431 , in 2014 dollars .Mr. Obama even exceeds Mr. Johnson , whose budget priorities amounted only to $ 111 per poor person . ( Because Mr. Johnson was the first postwar president to tackle poverty issues with so many new programs , it is not surprising that his proposed funding levels were low at the start . ) The same pattern shows up in spending per poor family . Mr. Obama allocated $ 67,132 , Mr. Clinton $ 39,820 , Mr. Carter $ 20,790 , and Mr. Johnson $ 546 , again using 2014 dollars .Nor is Mr. Obama simply a big spender across the board . His spending on the Department of Agriculture , for example , was lower than Mr. Clinton’s and Mr. Carter’s , removing food stamps and adjusting for inflation .A final test of priorities is how much a president proposes to spend compared with his immediate predecessor . By that yardstick , Mr. Obama does well too . The percent change in anti-poverty spending per poor individual is highest for Mr. Clinton relative to the first President Bush ( 27 percent ) , and lowest for Mr. Carter , who actually spent slightly less than Gerald R. Ford . Mr. Obama’s increase relative to George W. Bush was a respectable 17 percent . When it comes to the poor , Mr. Obama does not appear a failure , much less an epic one .So why does Mr. Obama elicit fiery condemnation for lacking empathy ? His first four State of the Union speeches provide several telltale clues . These are a president’s showcase , watched , in recent years , by up to 52 million viewers . What did Mr. Obama signal to those millions ?First , he rarely mentioned poverty . Listeners had to hunt for words like “poor” or “homeless.” His average poverty word count is seven , lower than Mr. Carter’s nine and Mr. Clinton’s 23 . Second , the little he did say was drowned in a wave of words aimed at the middle class , like “average earner.” His ratio of middle-class-related words to poverty-related words was nearly 3 to 1 .When he did mention the needs of the poor , he tiptoed around them . His ratio of direct mentions of poverty to indirect mentions was 1 to 3 . Contrast that with Mr. Clinton’s 8-to-1 ratio . Even Mr. Carter’s was higher than Mr. Obama’s ( 1 to 2 ) . By favoring words like “vulnerable” and “unemployed” so heavily , Mr. Obama nearly gave up the bully pulpit .While critics are right to chastise Mr. Obama for his pallid rhetoric on race , at least as president , they are wrong to say that he does not care about poor communities of color . Mr. Obama has been spending without saying . He should get at least as much credit for the former as vilification for the latter .
The website SCOTUSblog is applying , once again , for credentials to cover SCOTUS , the Supreme Court of the United States . It’s already been turned down twice . But the Senate Press Gallery , which is in charge of such things , should relent this time around . At least , that is , if the site completes the transformation it started about seven years ago , from what was essentially a promotional website for a legal practice , to a fully independent journalistic venture .In the past three years , scotusblog ( that’s how users refer to it ) has received key awards for legal journalism and proven itself indispensable to a fast-growing group of lay followers in addition to the judges , law clerks , lawyers and academics who closely observe the Supreme Court . Yesterday , a slow day at the court , the site received 37,000 visits . Last June , the day the court handed down its ruling upholding much of the Affordable Care Act , around a million people learned about the decision via the site’s live blog . The site covers the court more comprehensively than it has ever been covered—every argument and every case decided as well as important-seeming requests for the court to review a lower-court ruling . The site provides links to all briefs from competing parties and friends of the court . Its contents are available without charge .In October last year , Bloomberg News became the site’s sponsor under a three-year contract making it the sole advertiser in exchange for covering the site’s operating expenses , $ 332,000 this year . That has allowed scotusblog to pay the equivalent of three and a half full-time employees and about 20 part-time employees .Lyle Denniston , the site’s full-time reporter at the court , is by far the most important scotusblogger and has been since he joined the site in 2004 . At 81 , he has been covering the court for 54 years—18 for The Washington Star ( now defunct ) , almost 20 for The Baltimore Sun . His credentials to cover the court are now through WBUR , an FM radio station based in Boston .Under his old-school approach — he decides what he writes about , in well-informed , judicious pieces of analysis and explanation — scotusblog emphasizes carefully gathered information over quickly manufactured opinion and emphasizes the court rather than self-promotion .But that’s not how the site ran when it started , which is likely part of why the Senate Press Gallery has been so coy . Ten years ago , the current publisher , Tom Goldstein , and the current editor , Amy Howe , married to each other then as now and lawyers both , launched scotusblog as a vehicle for advertising their budding law practice . Their theory was that blogging about the court would demonstrate their expertise and bring them clients . They have succeeded in building an admired practice , but , as Mr. Goldstein told me , no thanks to version 1.0 of the site .As scotusblog evolved into a relied-on news source , its staff developed policies for avoiding conflicts of interest . The site adheres to standards Mr. Denniston shaped to ensure that scotusblog is seen as “impartial” and “objective”—including about Mr. Goldstein’s arguments before the court . ( In October , Mr. Denniston wrote that a tack Mr. Goldstein tried “only seemed to confuse things , and the Justices ( perhaps affected by inattention ) were not following . If his argument did not seem exactly doomed , it looked , at best , shaky.” )But the only way to guarantee that there are no conflicts of interest for the site is for it to become independent of Mr. Goldstein and Ms. Howe’s firm , with Mr. Goldstein giving up his role as publisher and Ms. Howe her role as editor while they are practicing before the Supreme Court . The journalism they launched is now too important to be saddled with an asterisk .
By Casey NeistatDiet programs revolve around a proven principle : if you burn more calories than you consume , you will lose weight . The calorie is the defining metric . And so , in the interest of public health , the Food and Drug Administration requires most packaged foods to list their calories , among other data , on labels . To help combat obesity in New York City , the Department of Health requires most chain restaurants to post calorie content on their menus and fines those who don’t comply . Thanks to the Affordable Care Act , a national program will soon follow .In theory , this is a valuable reform . But there’s one glaring problem . According to the F.D.A . and the city’s health department , no one verifies the accuracy of these calorie listings . The system essentially runs on an honor system . Food vendors can list whatever numbers they want , until someone ( somehow ) catches a problem and files a complaint . So , as an obsessive calorie counter myself , I wanted to find out : how accurate are these labels ?For this Op-Doc video , I selected five items I might consume in an average day : a muffin , a tofu sandwich , a Subway sandwich , a Starbucks Frappuccino and a Chipotle burrito . Then , two food scientists at the New York Obesity Nutrition Research Center at St. Luke’s-Roosevelt Hospital Center painstakingly tested the caloric content of each using a device called a bomb calorimeter . It’s a precise but slow process — taking more than an hour per sample . The results were surprising .SPOILER ALERT : Four out of the five items I tested had more calories than their labels reported , adding up to 550 calories . If I unknowingly consumed those extra calories every day , in a week I would put on an extra pound of body weight . Not good .After you watch the video , you might wonder how to explain the discrepancies between the lab tests and the food labels . I called the companies for some answers .• Morrisons Pastry company , which makes muffins sold at many corner bodegas in New York , said it did not want to comment on its muffins . So I have no idea how to explain those extra calories .• An employee at the tofu sandwich company , whose sandwich had nearly double the number of calories the label stated , told me that he wasn’t sure how the company came up with the data . He said the company would look into it and , if it found results similar to mine , would change the information on its labels .• Starbucks and Chipotle both explained that , since their products are made by hand at their shops , there are often small variations in calories . Neither Starbucks nor Chipotle measures calories in a lab , like I did . Instead , they do it on paper — adding up the calories of each ingredient . Dr. Russell Rising from the obesity research lab told me that this process can be especially inaccurate as the calorie values for each ingredient are often outdated .• Subway said it conducts both in-house and “independent” studies to substantiate its calorie information . A spokesman emphatically stressed that the accuracy of nutritional data is important to the company .By testing only five items , my little study is hardly conclusive — I was left with more questions than answers . So it would be unfair for me to make broad conclusions about the food industry or point fingers at specific companies . But there’s one thing I can say for certain : our current system for regulating calories is woefully inadequate . With all the attention focused on what our government can do to curb the obesity epidemic , why not start by policing nutritional data ?
The government’s new nutrition labels — the first in 20 years — will let families know whether their food has added sugars for the first time , and reflect more realistic portion sizes .Related : New W.H.O . guidelines recommend that sugar make up only 5 percent of your daily calories . That’s 100 calories , which at four calories a gram would be 25 grams of sugar .This is why we’re unhealthy , Buzzfeed explains in a video . For instance : The average person consumes 19 tablespoons of sugar a day , the maximum recommended amount recommended by the American Heart Association is 6 to 9 teaspoons .Federal health authorities reported a seemingly impressive 43 percent drop in the obesity rate among 2- to 5-year-old children over the past decade .

CAN we still be arguing about a woman’s ability to control her own fertility ? Almost 50 years ago in Griswold v. Connecticut , the Supreme Court struck down state restrictions on contraception because they violated a right to privacy . But the issue has not gone away . Rick Santorum injected it into the presidential race by indicating that Griswold should be overturned so that states could ban contraception altogether . And the Senate just voted down a Republican effort to allow employers and health insurance companies to refuse coverage for contraceptives if they had moral or religious objections .Why are issues that the courts decided so long ago still unresolved ? Maybe it is time to recognize that law alone is not enough to effect social change . It must be linked to social activism on behalf of women’s rights .I should know . Fifty-five years ago , I had an opportunity to take a stand in favor of the right of women to control their fertility — and I did so through the courts .It was 1957 , and fresh out of the University of Wisconsin I enrolled in the Yale Law School — one of only six women in my graduating class . In my second year at Yale , several of our professors asked my husband and me to join a lawsuit challenging Connecticut’s birth-control law , which outlawed the sale and use of contraceptive materials and prohibited a doctor from prescribing birth control even to married women . One goal of the lawsuit was to remove the statutory obstacle to opening Planned Parenthood clinics in Connecticut so that poor families could have access to family-planning services .I immediately agreed to join the case . Others did as well , but my husband and I were the only ones to use our real names . Because people used pseudonyms , the lead case came to be called Poe v. Ullman , but there was a companion case called Trubek v. Ullman . Poe raised a variety of grounds for challenging the statute and eventually landed in the Supreme Court .I was proud to put my name on the case . To serve as a plaintiff , though a largely passive role , suited my vision of my future as a social justice lawyer . I supported Planned Parenthood . I believed women should have access to birth control so they could have both a career and a family . I wanted those things for myself . I was no sexual radical : I was married , a “good girl” uninterested in sexual freedom , and I thought of abortion as frightening . But I was planning to have a family and a career as a lawyer . I believed I should be free to choose the timing of my children’s births so I could do both .Poe was thrown out by the Supreme Court on a technicality . To force the issue , Planned Parenthood opened a clinic , leaving the state with no choice but to close it down . This landed the issue back in the Supreme Court — this time with different plaintiffs , as Griswold v. Connecticut — which found the statute an unconstitutional intrusion on marital privacy .The privacy argument in Griswold led to the legalization of contraception . But it also had a much larger impact : the privacy doctrine played a central role in Roe v. Wade ( 1973 ) , which declared some barriers to abortion unconstitutional ; was used by the court in Lawrence v. Texas ( 2003 ) , which struck down bans on consensual same-sex sexual activity ; and has been cited in state court decisions upholding same-sex marriage .We can celebrate Griswold , Roe and all the cases that stemmed from the Poe litigation . They are important landmarks in American jurisprudence . But as I look back I am dismayed by how few of the issues I was fighting for at the time of Poe are resolved . To be sure , we have important rights and more legal privacy . But we still have not provided all the support women need to combine rewarding careers and healthy families . Planned Parenthood is under siege and poor women who are seeking comprehensive reproductive care are still at risk . Presidential candidates can get away with saying that all contraception should be outlawed . Comprehensive child care services are difficult to locate , and fully financed family and medical leave is still controversial .In short , we won the legal battle but not the war . Women are still not guaranteed control over their lives , because the necessary social supports were never secure . The initial goal of Griswold was to help women — and even though the precedent has helped with same-sex marriage laws , those initial needs , especially of poor women , have been left largely unmet .The universal coverage plan outlined in President Obama’s Affordable Care Act is a good step forward , and we should do all we can to ensure it . Perhaps if activism had been linked to the lawsuits , the aims I fought for would have been secured , and we would be spared the spectacle of Republican candidates threatening , yet again , a woman’s right to control her own fertility .
BERKELEY , Calif. â CONGRESS began its summer recess last week and wonât reconvene until after Labor Day . Youâd be forgiven for not noticing a difference . With just 15 bills signed into law so far this year , the 113th Congress is on pace to be the most unproductive since at least the 1940s .But just because the legislature has ceased to function doesnât mean our government has . Political decision making has moved to peripheral public entities , where power is exercised less transparently and accountability to voters is less direct . What weâre losing in the process isnât government â itâs democracy .Take the Federal Reserve . Absent any Congressional legislation to speak of â no short-term spending to increase job growth , no long-term plan to reduce the budget deficit â the nationâs central bank has been forced to do all the heavy lifting with the economy . The $ 85 billion of bonds it buys each month is now the main form of government stimulus to the economy as well as the linchpin of continued job growth . Congressâs inability to pass effective fiscal policy means that the Fedâs monetary policy , to keep long-term interest rates as low as possible , has become the only game in town for boosting private spending and investment .But the strategy also poses serious risks , like asset bubbles , if borrowers use the cheap money to speculate ; bond collapses , if the Fed slows its bond buying too quickly and spooks the market ; and inflation , if low interest rates cause buyers and sellers to expect prices to rise . It could also increase income inequality , by giving wealthy investors a cheap source of funds to expand their portfolios . Forcing the Fed to become the sole decision maker on the economy is also why the selection of a new Fed chairman has become so important â even more important than it ought to be .Congressâs paralysis has also encouraged the Supreme Court to enter the political fray . Normally the judicial activism of recent years could be checked by Congressional action . But not now . Justice Anthony M. Kennedyâs opinion for the majority in the 2010 Citizens United case , which struck down limits on corporate campaign contributions , rested partly on the presumption that Congress would require corporations to disclose their political expenditures . But no bill requiring full disclosure has stood a chance of making it through the quagmire .The courtâs decision this summer in Shelby County v. Holder handed Congress the task of coming up with a new , updated formula for deciding which states and localities need permission from the Justice Department , under the Voting Rights Act , to make changes to their election processes . But legislative paralysis makes the passage of any new formula highly unlikely . Seen in this light , Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.âs deciding vote last year to uphold the Affordable Care Act probably reflected his reasonable fear that the court would otherwise be viewed , not unfairly , as just another political battleground .Or consider climate change . Itâs a public debate the nation briefly embarked on in the 2008 presidential race , when John McCain and Barack Obama presented different plans for cap-and-trade systems . Naturally , gridlock in Congress put an end to it . After the election , Mr. McCain backed off any cap-and-trade plan , and the two parties have been at loggerheads over the environment ever since .The issue ultimately lost the spotlight to a debate over Mr. Obamaâs choice for administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency , Gina McCarthy , who is expected to use the E.P.A.âs authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate the carbon emissions of power plants ; and to a Congressional showdown , motivated in part by Mr. Obamaâs E.P.A . appointment , over the use of the filibuster on presidential nominees .Mr. Obama won the skirmish and got his administrator , but donât expect much public deliberation over carbon emissions from here on . The E.P.A . will handle the issue through regulatory rule making , mostly unchecked by Congress and the public .A final displacement of national politics has been onto state governments , now grappling with everything from undocumented immigrants and gun control to gay marriage and abortion . While many political matters should be left to the states , these cry out for federal standards because of the relative ease with which undocumented immigrants , gun sellers , gay couples and women seeking abortions can transport themselves to more accommodating jurisdictions .Whatâs more , these institutions arenât even understood by the public to be making political decisions with national implications . Media coverage tends to be narrowly drawn for insiders â macroeconomists , constitutional scholars , E.P.A . watchers , the residents of a particular state â or trivialized for outsiders : Should the next Fed chief be female ? Are Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas too openly partisan ? Is Ms. McCarthy too much of a firebrand ? Are âredâ states diverging from âblueâ states ?The Republican right â mostly new House members who are supported by the Tea Party and who are in open rebellion against the rest of the right â are probably pleased with the gridlock in Congress . They would like nothing better than to stop the federal government from functioning . But they may not fully grasp that their efforts have only shifted power elsewhere in the system .Some of the institutions gaining power may be making decisions consistent with conservative values : the Supreme Court and some state governments , for instance . But hardly all ( the Fed and the E.P.A . ) .In any event , itâs bizarre that a self-styled populist insurrection would end up making our government less accountable to the people . But thatâs exactly what itâs done . Whatâs really gridlocked now is democracy .
Reince Priebus made a joke on Sunday .I don’t know that he meant to — comedy isn’t his forte — but the only way to hear one of his comments on “Meet the Press” was as a put-on . He said that Hillary Clinton wouldn’t run for the presidency if “she has another month like she just had , ” with questions about Monica , about Benghazi , about Boko Haram , about her brain .I almost fell down . For one thing , she’s had countless months like that . For another , they’re the only kind on the horizon : Hillary as the fodder for the morning talk shows ( on Sunday’s panels , she came up 98 times , according to a Washington Post tally ) and Hillary as a piñata for late-night comedians ; strenuously marketed Hillary scandals with a modicum of merit and strenuously marketed Hillary scandals with none .If Republicans believed in global warming , they’d surely divine her hand in it . Speaking of body parts , I suspect we’ll move from Hillary’s brain to her heart , probably her liver , possibly her pancreas and maybe even her pinkie toe . What Hillary goes through in the public arena isn’t an examination . It’s a vivisection .That she endures it is admirable . That she’s so willing to is scary . With all politicians , you worry about the intensity of the hunger that enables them to suffer the snows of Iowa and the slings and arrows of outrageous pundits . With Hillary and Bill , you worry that it’s rapaciousness beyond bounds .You also grow weary . The Clintons are exhausting . And that’s just one of many drawbacks worth discussing as Hillary plays Hamlet , mulling what to do .She’s without doubt the contender to bet on . But she’s a contender with baggage and obstacles that get woefully short shrift in all the nonstop chatter about her inevitability .For starters , Americans have been in a pessimistic mood for an unusually sustained period , their faith in the political system at rock bottom . How does someone who’s been front and center in that system for more than two decades — who’s a symbol of intense partisan warfare — become the voice of change ? There’s no “Don’t Stop ( Thinking About Tomorrow ) ” for Hillary . Tomorrow was yesterday .Remarks she made in Washington on Friday illustrated that point . At a conference titled “Big Ideas for a New America , ” she mused about what “the 1990s taught us , ” looking into the future by traveling into the past , which isn’t the terrain on which presidential elections are typically won .Bill traveled there just two and a half weeks earlier , in a speech of his own at Georgetown University . “Speech” is too paltry a word ; this was one of those ego extravaganzas , like his aria at the Democratic National Convention , that went on and on and reaffirmed his talent for making everything , including the current income-inequality debate , about him . In this case he was singing the praises of his own presidency’s economic record .He was also serving notice that despite his screw-ups during Hillary’s 2008 campaign , it may be impossible to muzzle him in 2016 . Just last week , on yet another stage , he again joined the fray , proclaiming Hillary blameless for Benghazi and vouching that her concussion was merely that . There’s a thin line between chivalry and butting in . Can he stay on the right side of it ? If not , he could hurt her candidacy , overshadowing her and undercutting her feminist story line .She has additional challenges . If Obama’s approval rating doesn’t rise , his would-be successors will be best served by breaking with him . For Hillary that’s hard . Given her history on health insurance , she can’t run against the Affordable Care Act . Given her role in his administration , she can’t run against his foreign policy .How does she simultaneously defend and defy him ? It’s a balancing act that Al Gore never perfected in regard to her husband .The last month has indeed been instructive , demonstrating how practiced Republicans are at attacking her — and how exuberant they are about it . I think they want her to run . She’s the devil they know . She’s the dragon worth slaying .She’s considered inevitable in part because she’s political royalty , awash in money and celebrity endorsements , but is royalty what an economically frustrated , embittered electorate wants ? With fame of her duration and magnitude , how does she find a common touch ?And how does she show us anything that she hasn’t shown us before , introducing or even reintroducing herself ?Maybe any sense of staleness will be expunged by the prospect of a first female president , but she lacks an opportunity that many successful presidential candidates enjoyed : that period of the rollout when a more detailed biography emerges , a personality is defined and voters get a chance to swoon .We can’t fall in love that way with Hillary , not at this point . We’re too far past the roses and Champagne .
“What if we gave her some aloe vera gel ? ”The question was from a thin woman , and though her query came out of desperation , her face was pinched with fury . She was a relative of the patient in the room , a young woman who was dying of an infection .That’s where gel , which the relative embraced as an herbal remedy , came in . It fell to me , the nurse , to explain why aloe vera could not cure the infection , could not save this patient’s life . But what I was really doing was something we often fail to do in hospitals : facing the anger and fear that accompany impending death .It’s not easy to talk about death . President Obama acknowledged this reluctance when he tried to include reimbursement for end-of-life conversations in the Affordable Care Act . The conservatives’ ease at recasting such efforts as government “death panels” shows how hard the topic of death is for many people . There is a point of breakdown at which a body will irrevocably fail . In health care we understand that in terms of physiological details . What’s hard for all of us is accepting the painful truth that people die .The patient in this case had received a stem cell transplant from a matched donor to treat her cancer . She had been taking immune suppressants to keep the donated cells from attacking her own body . The challenge is that such patients are susceptible to infections that wouldn’t trouble healthy people . That’s what happened with this patient . She contracted a fungal infection , and despite our best efforts at treatment , it got into her brain .For several weeks she had been asking for all curative treatment to stop , but her doctors kept saying it was too soon . At the point where I was assigned to her , the doctors had finally agreed that nothing more could be done to save her life . As a result of that decision the extended family had gathered to say goodbye . That was the group I walked in on when I took over the patient’s care in the afternoon .The relatives from far away had not seen the patient’s sad and slow decline . They were not prepared to say goodbye , and they were angry . The doctors had given up on her , they said . Her husband wanted her to die . No one was trying hard enough to find the one thing that could save her . Maybe aloe vera gel would be the silver bullet .I had been this patient’s nurse often in the past , but not recently , so I didn’t have solid answers for them . “Wait , ” I finally said as the questions came fast and furious , “I’m not putting you off . I need to read her chart so that I can accurately tell you what you want to know . I will come back.”I was lucky ; I had time to sit down and make sense of the patient’s treatment history , even though there wasn’t a lot of sense-making to be done . Roughly 30 percent of patients are dead within a year of such stem cell transplants , and this patient fell within that group .You can’t tell a family only that , though , because there’s no balm in it . And by balm I mean empathy for just how terrible it is for someone known and loved to die .I went back to the room and again was lucky to have the time to really talk with the angry relatives . I told them the story of this young woman’s cancer treatment , how she got high doses of chemotherapy to kill her cancer and the infusion of stem cells afterward essentially gave her a new immune system . I talked about immune suppression creating vulnerabilities to odd illnesses , like fungal infections . I told them the patient herself had been asking to go into hospice care long before her doctors assented .I said that a body can get too broken to be repaired and , despite all our drugs and scans and cutting-edge procedures , sometimes we just can’t fix someone , even if we ourselves helped create the problem that is killing her .The aloe vera gel came up again , and I said it probably wouldn’t hurt . The thin woman , now in the chair , her legs tightly crossed in front of her , waved my suggestion away with a quick flip of her wrist and I realized that the relatives weren’t really intent on giving the patient aloe vera ; what they needed was for someone in the hospital to understand how much they wanted this young woman to live , how desperate they were to reverse fate .We can call this denial , hubris , fighting until the bitter end . But why not call it what it is ? Being human and fearing death , the family could not , in the words of Dylan Thomas , stop raging against the dying of the light .We read that famous poem as an exhortation : “Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night.” I wonder if it is instead a reckoning of how very difficult it is to let life go ; the poem was , after all , written about Thomas’s own father . “Wise men at their end know dark is right , ” the poem tells us , but they and “good men , ” “wild men , ” “grave men” do not go gentle , because death inevitably brings regret for what might have been , what now will never be .The idea that compensation be given for discussions about patients’ health care choices at the end of their lives targeted this existential knot . It takes time to untangle the threads surrounding death — guilt , fear , anger and love — but it’s work that needs to be done , by nurses and doctors , following the patient’s preferences and physical reality . Because no matter how much we hate it , death will come .I’ve seen a fair number of people die , and the truth is , some go gentle into that good night , but many do not , regardless of their intentions . For my patient it was the same . Her mind seemed to have acquiesced weeks before , but her body , so fragile and battered by disease , hadn’t . A good friend of mine was her nurse the day she died . “I need to talk to you , ” she told me soon after the patient’s passing . So long in coming and impossible to reverse , the end itself had been bloody , even gruesome . It was a hard memory for my friend , a seasoned oncology nurse , to bear alone .I’ve never forgotten that afternoon in the hospital . Outside , day turned to dusk and then evening . The patient occasionally moaned , but was mostly silent . The thin woman in the chair was still angry , but as dark filled the windows outside the frustration in the room sublimated into a dull acceptance . We did not go gently into that good night , but we went , nonetheless .Theresa Brown is an oncology nurse and the author of “Critical Care : A New Nurse Faces Death , Life , and Everything in Between.”
Mary White makes house calls . She’s a senior community health worker in Philadelphia in the IMPaCT program at the Penn Center for Community Health Workers . She has 25 of the University of Pennsylvania Health System’s toughest patients . It’s her job to help them set health goals and , step by step , carry them out .One of her patients is Grover Wilson , an engaging man of 56 who weighs 515 pounds . Wilson had long been athletic and sociable , the organizer of a long-running community volleyball game . But depression and an injury led him to gain weight . Now he lives in a tiny basement apartment packed floor to ceiling with boxes of his possessions , and is trapped and isolated by his weight .White has been visiting Wilson for three months . He’s lost 15 pounds during that time , with the help of a group class at the Penn Center and her visits . “How are you doing on your goal to cut down on sugary drinks ? ” she asks . What about your snacks ? “I’ve finished all my hummus and pretzels , ” he says . “I’m going to get some baby carrots , and more hummus , and pita chips.”“That’s good , that’s good , ” White says . “They’re having a sale on hummus.”They talk about his exercise goal : walking up and down his hallway . “As usual , I’m not doing a great job on my own , ” he said . “It’s very easy when you’re alone and obese and have sleep apnea and other problems to say , ‘I just want to give up.’ Depression comes and goes . But today’s a good day.” He means because White is visiting .“You’ll do it . I took half a person off me , ” White says — she accompanies another patient to the gym , and she’s lost 50 pounds so far . “My knees are feeling better . You’ll do it . Be around positive people.”They talk about his other problems . He’s on a payment plan with the power company , worried about his next payment . “But then I got my S.S.I . rebate , ” he says . “Now I can pay my bills.”“I’m so happy ! ” White beams : “Why didn’t you tell me ? ”Wilson squeezes her hand . “You don’t get half , you know , ” he says , smiling .In 2010 , researchers from Penn began interviewing patients who lived in high-poverty neighborhoods about what they saw as barriers that kept them from getting health care , and kept them sick . Those responses — from long interviews with 115 patients — became the basis of the Penn Center and IMPaCT , which stands for “individualized management for patient-centered targets.”The center’s community health workers , or C.H.W.s — seven now , but there will be 30 next year — visit some of Penn Medicine’s poorest and sickest patients : people who live in high-poverty neighborhoods , are hospitalized or have two chronic diseases , and either have Medicaid or no insurance at all . Since they began seeing patients in 2011 , they’ve treated 1,800 of them . They expect to work with that number every year starting in 2015 .Many poor countries use C.H.W.s on an enormous scale — in rural areas , where doctors and nurses are scarce , a C.H.W . often serves as the doctor . In the United States , their role is different . White and her colleagues have no medical training . ( Before this , she was a family health worker with the Supportive Child Adult Network . ) They’re chosen for their ability to listen , support and encourage , without judgment . They are people from the same communities as their patients , and often with the same struggles . They help patients with the many factors keeping them sick that aren’t typical doctor problems .This is a crucial role in a country where vast numbers of people are sick with chronic lifestyle-related diseases . Doctors can’t help patients change their behavior in the 15 minutes they spend with each patient . But community health workers can .Yet C.H.W.s are few in the United States . Some “promotora” programs employ them in Native American and Latino communities , especially with migrant workers . A few states make them a part of health care — and Obamacare will increase that number .“Every so often you see a foundation sink a lot of money into community health worker programs , ” said Prabhjot Singh , a Columbia professor and doctor in East Harlem who is co-chair of the One Million Community Health Workers Campaign . “The DNA of a lot of these programs comes from an activist , almost anti-bottom-line perspective . They are grant funded , and there’s a lot of academic interest but there is not a way to systematically invest in C.H.W.s.” So even though many studies — this is a good compilation ( pdf ) — show they improve health and save money , these programs rarely last very long or grow .The Penn Center was founded by Shreya Kangovi , an internist and pediatrician who is an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School . Before she and her colleagues designed the IMPaCT program , they reviewed other C.H.W . programs to see why they didn’t last .They found several common problems . Most important , C.H.W.s were rarely integrated into a health care system’s processes or its financing . “They were often all by themselves , in a church basement , ” Kangovi said . “If they were doing great work , no one knew about it and no one paid for it.” Many programs vanished when their grant money disappeared .There were also staffing problems — lots of turnover , lots of workers who weren’t right for the job . Organizations didn’t understand what kinds of skills they needed and how to identify the people who had them . Many C.H.W . programs were disease-specific — but a lot of patients have multiple serious illnesses . And the work wasn’t standardized : Few programs had manuals , for example . Each new worker was re-inventing the job .Kangovi and her colleagues tried to attack these problems systematically . They decided that C.H.W.s wouldn’t limit their scope , but help patients with any health goal . They made hiring decisions and designed a manual and formal training based on the barriers to care cited by the patients . They aimed to have a plug-and-play model that other hospitals could use .It is still early , but there are some good signs . Staff turnover has been zero . The researchers tracked the impact of having a C.H.W . visit patients at hospital discharge and for two weeks after . Patients who got the visits saw a doctor sooner , had better mental health and were less likely to later have multiple readmissions than patients in a control group . ( The program had no effect on patients’ physical health or medication adherence — not unexpected given such a brief intervention , ) The long-term home visits the C.H.W.s do now are aimed at improving patients’ chronic diseases . The center is halfway through a long study looking at that .The Penn Center is one of several new models hospitals are trying to make C.H.W . programs sustainable . ( There’s a whole other way of doing this , too — programs run by community organizations , paid for largely by cities or states . ) Another is Grand-Aides . Unlike the Penn C.H.W.s , Grand-Aides don’t help with social or logistical issues . They are nurse extenders who get hundreds of hours of medical training . Each patient visit is supervised in real time by phone by a nurse , who makes all the decisions . A pilot at two pediatric Medicaid sites in Texas showed that the program cut readmissions by at least two-thirds .Arthur Garson Jr. , who directs the Health Policy Institute of the Texas Medical Center in Houston and founded Grand-Aides , believes that C.H.W . programs have stayed small because most don’t certify their workers . His program requires each Grand-Aide to pass a test for certification every year . It’s a way of standardizing the work and building confidence with hospitals . “Hospitals want to know they are competent and tested yearly , ” he said . Currently 14 hospitals in the United States use Grand-Aides — Garson says the program will be in 40 hospitals by spring 2015 .Do hospitals make money from C.H.W . programs ? Some believe they do . Garry L. Scheib , the chief operating officer of the University of Pennsylvania Health System , said that Penn had a financial as well as a medical interest in putting the C.H.W . program in its budget and tripling its size .“The real economic benefit for us is the open beds it creates , ” he said . “I usually have a waiting list for inpatient beds.” Hospitals profit most by filling those beds with patients who need complex , specialty surgeries and care — especially when they carry private insurance . IMPaCT patients , by contrast , often need routine care , or non-medical help . They carry Medicaid ( which brings in little revenue ) or are uninsured ( a total loss ) . Hospitals must accept these patients , so keeping them as healthy as possible — preferably outside the hospital — is good .Scheib said IMPaCT also saves Penn money because its staffers are a low-wage way ( their pay starts at $ 14 an hour ) to stretch and complement doctors and nurses who are paid a lot more .But Singh warns that only a minority of hospitals are solvent enough to see things the way Penn does . “Most have huge reservations about bringing on yet another work force , along with care managers and care coordinators . And providers don’t really have great incentives to reach out to Medicare and Medicaid patients that are hard to reach . If these patients don’t come to an appointment , well , that’s just how it goes . Maybe the hospital’s internal quality indicators go down a little — but it doesn’t warrant pounding the pavement to find these people.”Given the rarity of C.H.W . programs , this is obviously how many hospitals think . The emergency room is still a profit center for many hospitals , as long as patients have some insurance .Hospitals are also resistant because C.H.W . programs lie outside their core competency . “If it’s community health workers or nurses , they’ll always go with nurses . It’s easier — even if there’s a sizeable population nurses are unable to reach , ” said Heidi Behforouz , an associate physician in the global health equity division at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston . ( She ran Partners In Health’s PACT program , perhaps the most renowned C.H.W . program in the United States . Even that program didn’t survive the loss of charitable funding – it was transferred to another organization , in much diminished form . ) “Not a lot of places have glommed on to ‘Yes , we need the community health worker model.’ ”Obamacare is changing this calculus . Medicare now bases a small part of its reimbursement to hospitals on measures of quality , including readmissions — which gives hospitals an incentive to help patients stay healthy . In a major shift for C.H.W.s , the federal government this year permitted state Medicaid funds to pay for their work , as long as it was initially recommended by a doctor or other licensed practitioner .But the biggest change initiated by the Affordable Care Act is a gradual shift away from fee-for-service medicine to rewarding quality , not quantity . With that shift , hospitals and payers will be looking for what Singh calls “the lightweight infrastructure that takes care of people outside of the hospital.”“If fee-for-service disappears , there is more emphasis on prevention , wellness and quality of life in the long term , ” said Behforouz , “Then everybody would be pushing for community-based models that kept people at home.”Join Fixes on Facebook and follow updates on twitter.com/nytimesfixes .

You might think that the methodical extermination of millions of Jews by a brutal regime intent on world domination would resist appropriation as an all-purpose metaphor . You might think that genocide , of all things , would be safe from conversion into sloppy simile .Youâd be wrong .After Paul Ryanâs fact-challenged address at the Republican National Convention last year , the chairman of the Democratic Party in California actually compared him and his compatriots to the Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels . A short time later , the chairman of the Democratic Party in South Carolina likened that stateâs Republican governor , Nikki Haley , to Adolf Hitlerâs mistress , Eva Braun .At that point Abraham Foxman , the national director of the Anti-Defamation League , did what he shouldnât need to do even once , let alone the multiple times that heâs been forced to . He implored politicians and pundits to stop it already .No matter . Allusions to Nazi Germany were back for debates over gun control and , of course , Obamacare . Ted Cruz , the Senateâs prince of tirades , compared people who claim that the new insurance program canât be stopped to those who rolled over for Hitler and the Third Reich . This prompted a public reprimand from John McCain , who has developed something of a sideline career of swatting Cruz on the nose . Theyâre like a hapless master and his hopeless dachshund . The former keeps trying to housebreak the latter , while the latter just beams at every mess he makes .Itâs not only Nazis who are flourishing in this era of metaphors gone mad , of analogy bloat . Lynch mobs are also having a good go of it . A senator who was quoted anonymously in The Times last week used that term to describe the Republican lawmakers who had lit into Cruz during a private luncheon , and lynching was invoked more disturbingly by the chief executive officer of A.I.G. , who recently said that public complaints about Wall Street bankersâ bonuses were intended âto get everybody out there with their pitchforks and their hangman nooses.â This , he added , was âsort of like what we did in the Deep South.âHow absolutely bonkers . And yet how unsurprising . Weâre awash these days in metaphors as overworked as our political debate is overwrought , and itâs impossible not to wonder how much one contributes to the other . When nuance and perspective exit the language , do they exit the conversation as well ? When you speak in ludicrous extremes , do you think that way , too ?Obamacare has proved to be not just ideologically divisive but linguistically fertile . Thereâs seemingly no event or passage in American history to which it canât be compared .The terrorist attacks of 9/11 ? Check . Back when Mike Pence , Indianaâs Republican governor , was still in Congress , he summoned that dayâs horror to characterize the Supreme Court ruling that upheld the Affordable Care Act .Slavery ? Check . Ken Cuccinelli , the Republican candidate for governor of Virginia , has described opposition to Obamacare in terms of stands against fugitive slave laws .The hyperbole and hysteria make any constructive debate impossible , and they insult the past , robbing important events of the specific meaning and individual detail they deserve . Consider our recurring â-gateâ mania . We equate each new scandal , whether extra-large or fun-size , with Watergate , and by willfully misremembering President Richard Nixonâs crimes , we dilute them . Itâs just a suffix for the taking , a point of comparison for such wildly unrelated matters as the spilled secrets of Arkansas law enforcement officers who were supposedly privy to Bill Clintonâs private life . Troopergate , that was called .For President Obama , Benghazi was supposed to be his Watergate , and so was the I.R.S.âs scrutiny of conservative groups , and so were a bunch of other things I canât even remember anymore . They blur and fade , which is not to say they didnât matter . Itâs to say that when everything is supposedly like everything else , nothingâs distinctive . Itâs all one big mush .For that reason , among others , we should watch our words . They have consequences . As irresponsible and detestable as the recent actions of the most conservative wing of House Republicans have been , weâd be better off without figurative talk of hostage taking and guns to heads , without headlines like one in The Huffington Post that said : âBoehner Threatens to Shoot the Hostage.â That sort of language only turns up the heat .And I cringe at how pointlessly hurtful it must have been for a 9/11 widow or widower to listen to the right-wing moralist Gary Bauer exhort voters to fight back against President Obamaâs agenda the way passengers on United Flight 93 fought back against hijackers . Or for Holocaust survivors to hear all this gratuitous Nazi talk .You know whatâs just like Germany in the 1930s ? Germany in the 1930s . Weâre in an unfortunate place , but we neednât travel back there to describe it .
OAKLAND , Calif. â WHEN I lived in New York during the early 1960s , John F. Kennedy was a hero among the downtown art crowd â not because of any legislative or foreign policy achievement , but because he pardoned the jazz pianist Hampton Hawes .Hawes was a bebop pianist with a right-hand technique so brilliant that he was admired by none other than Art Tatum , widely considered the greatest jazz pianist ever . Hawes had been sentenced to 10 years in a Fort Worth prison for buying drugs from an undercover agent .âJust after my third Christmas I was watching John Kennedy accept the presidency on the Washington steps , â Hawes wrote later . âSomething about him , the voice , the eyes , the way he stood bright and coatless and proud in that cold air ... I thought , thatâs the right cat ; looks like he got some soul and might listen.â He applied for a pardon , and received one from the president on Aug. 16 , 1963 .Democrats have more of an affinity for jazz than Republicans . Even Jimmy Carter , not everybodyâs idea of a hipster , invited Dizzy Gillespie to the White House . But among the Democrats , President Obama is the one who comes closest to the style of bebop called âthe Cool.âCool jazz is exemplified by the saxophone of Lester Young and his protÃ©gÃ© Stan Getz ; the trumpet of Miles Davis ( especially on his 1957 album âBirth of the Coolâ ) ; the vibraphone of Milt Jackson and the song stylings of Billie Holiday , Sarah Vaughan and June Christy .Like the president , cool musicians carried themselves with a regal bearing . Some members of the generation before them had to engage in minstrel-like antics to make a living . Cool musicians demanded respect , and when attacked didnât blow up , but , like the president , responded stoically . One of his favorite words is âpersistence , â the attitude of his hero , the saxophonist Sonny Rollins , the greatest surviving bebopper .For a while in the mid-20th century , the Cool was everywhere . As youngsters in the â50s , my friends and I talked cool , walked cool and dressed cool . For us , if you werenât cool , you were hot , square or corny . We thought that Louis Armstrong was too hot and corny , until we read about his dispute with President Dwight D. Eisenhower over school integration . Armstrong had guts .Last month I got to see the president of the Cool at the San Francisco Jazz Center , a $ 64 million building that opened earlier this year . I am in my second term as its poet laureate , and one of my poems , âWhen I Die I Will Go to Jazz , â has been installed on one of the buildingâs walls ( in an alley named after Hawesâs memoir , âRaise Up Off Meâ ) , so I was invited to attend the event .The pianist who anchored the evening , Herbie Hancock , is cool . He was accompanied by other cool musicians , like the saxophonist Joshua Redman and the bassist Esperanza Spalding , who was so engaged in her instrument that she seemed attached to it .An added attraction were the SFJazz High School All-Stars , a group of white , black and Asian-American students . One of the graduates , the young flutist Elena Pinderhughes , performed with the trio and held her own .Outside , though , it was hot . Demonstrators against everything from military drones to energy pipelines greeted the presidentâs entourage when it arrived .After being introduced , the president just about bounced onto the stage . A few days earlier I had heard a commentator say he seemed in the dumps these days . That afternoon he was fresh , unruffled â in other words , cool . ( Maybe it was because our stateâs health-insurance exchange , Covered California , demonstrates how well the Affordable Care Act works when implemented correctly : My youngest daughter got a silver plan that drastically reduces her monthly premiums within an hour of applying . )One hallmark of a cool musician , like Ms. Spalding earlier in the evening , is an intensity and focus that lurks underneath the detached exterior . The same with Mr. Obama that night .He hit repeatedly on his version of the American dream , that if you work hard you can succeed , no matter who you are . His recent speeches have abandoned the âtough loveâ rhetoric that targeted blacks exclusively ; he now includes millions of whites in talking about a âtangle of pathologies , â something the political scientist Andrew Hacker first noticed in his 1992 book âTwo Nations.âAt one point , a member of the audience began heckling Mr. Obama , demanding that he be more aggressive on progressive legislative issues .The president replied , without skipping a beat , âA lot of people have been saying this lately on every problem . Just sign an executive order and we can do everything.â The Constitution tells him to do otherwise .Then the president of the Cool left to make a speech in Los Angeles .In 2010 Mr. Obama awarded the National Medal of Arts and Humanities to Mr. Rollins , the saxophonist . Oftentimes , there is a gulf between the people receiving this medal and the person conferring it . What does a president know about theater , or architecture ?Not so that day . When awarding Mr. Rollins the medal , the president said that his music had âhelped inspire me , or get me through a tough day , or take risks that I might not otherwise have taken.âI can dig it â an expression that is now considered corny .
WOODSTOCK , Ga. â THEREâS a political axiom that says if nobody is upset with what youâre doing , youâre not doing your job . Weâve seen this proved time and again in the liberal attacks on conservatives like Sarah Palin and Dr. Benjamin Carson , who provide principled examples to women and minorities and are savaged by the left for doing that job so well .But cheap-shot politics isnât relegated to Democrats . Last week the House speaker , John A. Boehner of Ohio , attacked conservative groups who criticized the budget deal , hashed out by Representative Paul D. Ryan , Republican of Wisconsin , and Senator Patty Murray , Democrat of Washington , for failing to reduce spending and for raising taxes .âTheyâre using our members and theyâre using the American people for their own goals , â he said , calling the opposition âridiculous.âIn one way , Mr. Boehner is correct . The goals of groups like ours are those that congressional Republicans once espoused : smaller government , less spending and lower taxes . Alas , those who demand such things today from their elected officials face unfounded attacks .Make no mistake : The deal is a betrayal of the conservatives who fueled the Republicansâ 2010 midterm shellacking of Democrats .It raises discretionary spending above $ 1 trillion for 2014 and 2015 . It reneges on $ 63 billion of sequester cuts . Its $ 28 billion in deficit reduction over the next decade is a pittance compared with the $ 680 billion deficit piled up in 2013 alone . And it raises taxes , particularly on airplane passengers through new travel fees .Perhaps most troubling is that the deal locks in spending for President Obamaâs Affordable Care Act , ensuring that the worst parts of Obamacare will continue unfolding to the shock of increasing numbers of Americans .But the budget plan is about more than taxes and spending . It was a slick means by which Senate Republicans could appear to oppose the deal while in fact allowing it to sail through the chamber .Take Senator Mitch McConnell , Republican of Kentucky , the minority leader , who opposed efforts to defund Obamacare earlier this year while claiming to do everything possible to stop it .After attacking conservative groups for their efforts to prevent the funding of Obamacare , Mr. McConnell , who is facing a primary challenge in his 2014 re-election race , is now seeking to portray himself as a conservative darling , championing fiscal austerity by voicing opposition to the budget proposal . ( My organization has not endorsed a candidate in that race . ) Doing so gives him some nifty talking points that align with most conservative groups , but it is little more than parliamentary sleight of hand .Consider how he handled the vote on the bill . To defeat a filibuster , its supporters needed 60 senators to win cloture and move to a final vote . Instead of rallying his troops against the vote , Mr. McConnell allowed a handful of Republicans in battleground states â who needed to be seen as supporting the bill â to vote for cloture , while he and the rest railed against it , casting themselves in the role of budget hawks .With cloture accomplished , a dozen Republicans were then free to vote against final passage if they need wiggle room when theyâre confronted on the campaign trail next fall by voters demanding action on government spending . Mr. McConnell and many Senate Republicans used the vote to manipulate the system , allowing them to cast themselves as deal makers or principled conservatives , depending on their audience .This is not principled policy making ; what weâre seeing is simple gamesmanship that raises legitimate questions about which values Republicans truly hold and which are merely interchangeable with those of Democrats .The job of Tea Party groups and other conservatives is pretty simple : to inform Americans about the need for restraint in spending , tax relief , pro-growth economic policies and individual liberty â and to support the men and women who pledge to promote these positions . To the extent that the speaker of the House and Senate Republicans are attacking such groups , it looks as if weâre doing our job .But after this budget vote , our job expands to include informing Americans about who keeps their word in Congress and who does not .When establishment Republicans call spending increases spending cuts , deny that raising taxes is a hike , and champion deficit reduction that doesnât scratch the surface of our nationâs debt , it suggests a detachment from the facts . But when those who voted for them criticize their elected officials for not keeping their promises , and are then attacked for doing so , it suggests that Kurt Vonnegut was right in observing , âA sane person to an insane society must appear insane.â
WHEN the Supreme Court announced its decision on the Affordable Care Act last month , the media went wild . The rush to judgment took seconds . CNN and Fox News initially described the decision incorrectly , saying five justices had struck down the law . Even after corrections , the snap analysis that followed wasn’t very helpful . The multipart decision is complex , and its ramifications will take months or even years to understand .The blink response to this case is only the latest example of a troubling increase in the speed of our reactions . E-mail , social media and the 24-hour news cycle are informational amphetamines , a cocktail of pills that we pop at an increasingly fast pace — and that lead us to make mistaken split-second decisions . Economists label the problem “present bias” : we are vulnerable to fast , salient stimulation .Fortunately , there is an antidote : the conscious pause . Scientists have found that although we are prone to snap overreactions , if we take a moment and think about how we are likely to react , we can reduce or even eliminate the negative effects of our quick , hard-wired responses .For example , countless studies have shown that physicians’ immediate , unconscious reactions to racial minorities lead them to undertreat black patients . In one study published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine in 2007 , researchers asked several hundred doctors about a hypothetical 50-year-old male patient who showed up with chest pain . The researchers gave the doctors a photograph of the man , randomly varying his race . Half saw him as white ; half saw him as black .Sure enough , although the doctors insisted they were not racially biased , they were more likely to prescribe thrombolysis , an anti-blood-clotting procedure , for the white patient , while giving the black patient a less-aggressive prescription . The doctors didn’t appear racist , yet their unconscious snap reactions led them to treat blacks differently — the very definition of racism .However , about one in four of the doctors guessed that the study was designed to test racial bias . They stopped for a moment and considered how they might react differently depending on race . The researchers found that this “aware” subgroup did not treat patients differently . Once they paused to consider whether race was an issue , race was no longer an issue .Snap decisions can be important defense mechanisms ; if we are judging whether someone is dangerous , our brains and bodies are hard-wired to react very quickly , within milliseconds . But we need more time to assess other factors . To accurately tell whether someone is sociable , studies show , we need at least a minute , preferably five . It takes a while to judge complex aspects of personality , like neuroticism or open-mindedness . If we need to understand how nine justices resolved a difficult legal issue , we need even more time .But snap decisions in reaction to rapid , even subliminal stimuli aren’t exclusive to the interpersonal realm . Sanford DeVoe and Chen-Bo Zhong , psychologists at the University of Toronto , found that viewing a fast-food logo for just a few milliseconds primes us to read 20 percent faster , even though reading has little to do with eating . We unconsciously associate fast food with speed and impatience and carry those impulses into whatever else we’re doing . Subjects exposed to fast-food flashes also tend to think a musical piece lasts too long .Yet we can reverse such influences . If we know we will overreact to consumer products or housing options when we see a happy face ( one reason good sales representatives and real estate agents are always smiling ) , we can take a moment before buying . If we know female job screeners are more likely to reject attractive female applicants , as a study by the economists Bradley Ruffle and Ze’ev Shtudiner shows , we can help screeners understand their biases — or hire outside screeners .John Gottman , the marriage guru made famous in Malcolm Gladwell’s best-selling book “Blink , ” explains that we quickly “thin slice” information reliably only after we ground such snap reactions in “thick sliced” long-term study . When Dr. Gottman really wants to assess whether a couple will stay together , he invites them to his island retreat for a much longer evaluation : two days , not two seconds .Our ability to mute our hard-wired reactions by pausing is what differentiates us from animals : primates and dogs can think about the future only intermittently or for a few minutes . But historically we have spent about 12 percent of our days contemplating the longer term .The beginning of summer is supposed to be the time for us to slow down and take a breath . Go to the beach with a few books . Spend downtime with family . Tune out . But instead of jumping into the swimming pool , we have leapt into a whirlpool of news .Still , although technology might change the way we react , it hasn’t changed our nature . We still have the imaginative capacity to rise above temptation and reverse the high-speed trend . There are a couple of summer months left , and no time to waste .
EARLIER this year , we got what seemed like the first good news on obesity rates : A study in JAMA found that there had been a 43 percent drop in the obesity rates of 2- to 5-year-old children in the last decade . But then , last month , that news was contradicted by researchers at the University of North Carolina who used the same data to find that obesity rates had remained flat after all .With two-thirds of adults and one-third of kids overweight or obese , it’s hard not to feel discouraged . If current trends continue , by 2030 , the incidence of obesity-related conditions like Type 2 diabetes could be 20 times what it is today , costing the American economy up to an additional $ 580 billion annually .Are we “losing the war on obesity , ” as the New York City mayor , Bill de Blasio , put it , and not doing enough to defeat it ? No . In fact , if we compare the fight against obesity to the last public health challenge of similar size — the fight against smoking — it turns out that we are being much more aggressive today .Research linking smoking to lung cancer began appearing in medical journals as early as the 1920s , but the dangers didn’t reach the popular press until 1952 , when Reader’s Digest published “Cancer by the Carton.” Still , smoking rates continued to rise . Between 1940 and 1964 , consumption more than doubled to nearly 4,500 cigarettes per adult per year . They were everywhere : Hollywood movies , military rations , the workplace , you name it .Finally , in 1964 , Luther L. Terry , the surgeon general , unveiled a report titled “Smoking and Health.” He called a Saturday news conference in which , for the first time , the government acknowledged that “smoking is causally related to lung cancer.”It still took until 1970 for Congress to ban cigarette advertising on TV and radio ; until 1975 for the military to stop including cigarettes in rations ; until 1982 for the federal cigarette excise tax to be raised ; until 1990 for Congress to ban smoking on domestic flights ; until 1997 for President Clinton to ban smoking in most government buildings ; until 1998 for cigarette manufacturers to acknowledge that smoking was addictive and caused cancer ; and until 2003 for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to ban smoking in New York City’s restaurants and bars . And it wasn’t until 2009 that the federal excise tax on cigarettes became truly effective , when it was raised to $ 1.01 .This multipronged effort — comprising advertising restrictions , prohibitions on where people could smoke and taxation — changed behavior and ultimately the nation’s health . Beginning in the mid-1970s , per capita cigarette consumption steadily declined . Today , the percentage of adult Americans who smoke is less than half what it was in Dr. Terry’s day — 18 percent — and per capita cigarette consumption is less than 1,500 per year .As a result , in the early 1990s , lung cancer deaths for men began to decline . For women the decline began in the mid-2000s . There is more to be done , but we have bent the tobacco curve .When it comes to obesity , the country has responded much more nimbly . Researchers first reported serious upticks in childhood and adolescent obesity in the mid-1980s , and policy makers quickly took notice .Within a decade , in 1994 , the Clinton administration limited the salt and saturated fat in school lunches . In 2001 , the surgeon general issued a “Call to Action.” In 2006 , three of the largest beverage companies voluntarily agreed to limit their offerings in school vending machines to water or low-calorie options . In 2010 , Michelle Obama started her “Let’s Move” campaign to end childhood obesity in a generation . And that same year the Affordable Care Act passed , with a provision requiring large restaurant chains to post calorie counts on their menus . In 2012 , Disney banned junk food advertising on all of its child-targeted TV and radio platforms . Today , 34 states and the District of Columbia have enacted some kind of additional tax on sodas and sugary drinks .True , many proposals have been stymied . The Food and Drug Administration seems to have given up on its consideration of front-of-the-pack labeling . Regulations implementing menu labeling still haven’t been issued . Proposed restrictions on advertising to children were suspended amid Republican attacks . And the soda industry has successfully repelled excise taxes in many states by deploying the same tactics the cigarette manufacturers used — sizable political contributions and charges of discrimination against the poor .But there do appear to be tentative signs that the obesity curve is flattening . A Robert Wood Johnson Foundation report last year found that adult obesity rates remained level in every state except Arkansas . And despite the dueling studies on childhood obesity rates nationwide , the rates among children in some of America’s largest cities appear to be coming down . In places like Philadelphia , New York City and Los Angeles , rates are down 3 to 5 percent compared with a few years ago .We can’t ease up now . Fully implementing calorie count provisions , requiring more explicit nutritional labeling and banning advertising of sugary sodas and other less nutritious foods to children would be good ways to keep up the momentum .But there is reason to be optimistic : We are moving much faster against obesity than we did on the successful effort against tobacco .
IF you listened to Justice Anthony M. Kennedy of the Supreme Court and his fellow conservatives on the bench this week , you might think the court’s 5-4 decision in the case of Town of Greece v. Galloway was no big deal . So what if a town in upstate New York typically opens its council meetings with prayers that acknowledge “the saving sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross” ?If you listened to the people who shepherded the case as it ascended the judicial hierarchy , however , the decision represents one of their biggest victories to date . It “wasn’t just an answer on prayer — it was an answer to prayer ! ” read a statement by the Family Research Council . The council is one of a host of organizations guided by the religious liberty advocacy group the Alliance Defending Freedom that backed the defendants with legal resources .To understand why the case’s backers were so cock-a-hoop , you must first know something about the long game being played by the religious right . The goal is to get back to a “soft” establishment of religion in America — that is , a system in which formal guarantees of religious freedom and the official separation of church and state remain in place , but one religion is informally or implicitly acknowledged as the “approved” religion of the majority and a legitimate basis for public policy .This was more or less the situation in the United States during the first half of the 19th century . In 1811 , the New York Supreme Court upheld a conviction for blasphemy ( the archetypal union of church and state ) on the grounds that the state had an interest in punishing offenses to the religious sensibilities of the Protestant majority . Back then , nativist Protestants imposed their version of the Bible in public schools , while Catholics rioted in protest and placed their children in parochial schools .Through the 19th and 20th centuries , however , the judicial thinking on church-state issues evolved , and the “soft” establishment became much harder to justify . The United States Supreme Court introduced the “Lemon test , ” for example . Named for a 1971 case the court heard , this required that legislation concerning religion should not result in “excessive government entanglement” with religious affairs . The Supreme Court also increasingly took the view that government should abstain from any activity wherein a reasonable observer might perceive it to be endorsing religion .Today , groups like the A.D.F . — which also represents Conestoga Wood Specialties Corporation in its challenge to the contraception mandate in the Affordable Care Act — are deeply unhappy with the reigning jurisprudence on church-state separation . It would seem that they wish to undermine the Lemon test , which they consider “burdensome , ” as a staging post to restoring a soft establishment of Christianity in the United States . This is where Greece v. Galloway comes in .The first order of business is to remove objections by swiping aside the idea that soft forms of establishment exist at all . Here , the Greece decision delivers , substantially .“Offense , ” Justice Kennedy wrote in his majority opinion , “does not equate to coercion.” Justice Clarence Thomas , in the part of his concurring opinion joined by Justice Antonin Scalia , drew out the key implication : “To the extent coercion is relevant to the Establishment Clause analysis , it is actual legal coercion that counts — not the ‘subtle coercive pressures’ allegedly felt by respondents in this case.” In other words , religious observance counts as “establishment” only if you are compelled to kneel by law .A second element of the plan for undermining concerns based on the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause is to reinterpret public acts as personal expressions of speech by private individuals . Thus , when the minister appointed by the municipal government of Greece bids “all rise , ” the Supreme Court majority tells us , this is not an establishment of religion because the words are not uttered by public officials . And when the town leaders respond with a sign of the cross , that isn’t establishment either , because , just then , public officials are acting as private individuals .Another prong in the assault on the Establishment Clause is to use neutrality among religious denominations as a wedge for inserting the ( presumed ) majority religion into state business . In theory , “neutrality” means giving every sect an equal shot at officiating prayer at Greece’s council meetings . In practice , the town government has unquestionably identified itself with what it takes to be the majority religion in the area .In his concurring opinion , Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. dismissed concerns about the blatantly sectarian tilt of the town’s proceedings , which were led exclusively by Christian ministers for nearly a decade , by pointing out that Jews make up a mere 3 percent of the local population and alleging that other non-Christian groups are no larger .A final , crucial part of the strategy is to substitute history — or , more accurately , a particular mythologized version of history — for legal analysis . Here the A.D.F . and its allies have hit pay dirt in the Greece decision .Justice Kennedy invoked an earlier , highly problematic decision in the case of Marsh v. Chambers to suggest that the usual legal tests were “unnecessary” because the “history supported the conclusion” that the prayers were compatible with the Establishment Clause . It is , however , preposterous to say that something is constitutional simply because it’s been done in the past .The “history” here sustains a myth that early America had a single religion of “Christianity , ” when , in fact , it was bitterly divided into antagonistic sects from the start . And many of America’s founders — James Madison , for example — were firmly opposed to such precedents of church-state entanglement as congressional chaplains .The assault by the religious right on the Establishment Clause has been unfolding for two decades , in a number of landmark cases . Under cover of pursuing “religious freedom , ” it has already succeeded in inserting fundamentalist religion into parts of America’s public education system . With Greece v. Galloway , it has now expanded the reach of this novel and destructive interpretation of the Establishment Clause . It is part of a project to “restore” a version of America that never was , and never can be .

CAMBRIDGE , Mass . â THEREâS an old lament about my profession : if you ask three economists a question , youâll get three different answers .This saying came to mind last week , when the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science was awarded to three economists , two of whom , Robert J. Shiller of Yale and Eugene F. Fama of the University of Chicago , might be seen as having conflicting views about the workings of financial markets . At first blush , Mr. Shillerâs thinking about the role of âirrational exuberanceâ in stock markets and housing markets appears to contradict Mr. Famaâs work showing that such markets efficiently incorporate news into prices .What kind of science , people wondered , bestows its most distinguished honor on scholars with opposing ideas ? âThey should make these politically balanced awards in physics , chemistry and medicine , too , â the Duke sociologist Kieran Healy wrote sardonically on Twitter .But the headline-grabbing differences between the findings of these Nobel laureates are less significant than the profound agreement in their scientific approach to economic questions , which is characterized by formulating and testing precise hypotheses . Iâm troubled by the sense among skeptics that disagreements about the answers to certain questions suggest that economics is a confused discipline , a fake science whose findings can not be a useful basis for making policy decisions .That view is unfair and uninformed . It makes demands on economics that are not made of other empirical disciplines , like medicine , and it ignores an emerging body of work , building on the scientific approach of last weekâs winners , that is transforming economics into a field firmly grounded in fact .It is true that the answers to many âbig pictureâ macroeconomic questions â like the causes of recessions or the determinants of growth â remain elusive . But in this respect , the challenges faced by economists are no different from those encountered in medicine and public health . Health researchers have worked for more than a century to understand the âbig pictureâ questions of how diet and lifestyle affect health and aging , yet they still do not have a full scientific understanding of these connections . Some studies tell us to consume more coffee , wine and chocolate ; others recommend the opposite . But few people would argue that medicine should not be approached as a science or that doctors should not make decisions based on the best available evidence .As is the case with epidemiologists , the fundamental challenge faced by economists â and a root cause of many disagreements in the field â is our limited ability to run experiments . If we could randomize policy decisions and then observe what happens to the economy and peopleâs lives , we would be able to get a precise understanding of how the economy works and how to improve policy . But the practical and ethical costs of such experiments preclude this sort of approach . ( Surely we donât want to create more financial crises just to understand how they work . )Nonetheless , economists have recently begun to overcome these challenges by developing tools that approximate scientific experiments to obtain compelling answers to specific policy questions . In previous decades the most prominent economists were typically theorists like Paul Krugman and Janet L. Yellen , whose models continue to guide economic thinking . Today , the most prominent economists are often empiricists like David Card of the University of California , Berkeley , and Esther Duflo of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , who focus on testing old theories and formulating new ones that fit the evidence .This kind of empirical work in economics might be compared to the âmicroâ advances in medicine ( like research on therapies for heart disease ) that have contributed enormously to increasing longevity and quality of life , even as the âmacroâ questions of the determinants of health remain contested .Consider the politically charged question of whether extending unemployment benefits increases unemployment rates by reducing workersâ incentives to return to work . Nearly a dozen economic studies have analyzed this question by comparing unemployment rates in states that have extended unemployment benefits with those in states that do not . These studies approximate medical experiments in which some groups receive a treatment â in this case , extended unemployment benefits â while âcontrolâ groups donât .
HANOVER , N.H. â A COUPLE of months ago , JAMA Internal Medicine , a journal of the American Medical Association , published the findings of a brief online survey of middle-aged Americans.Most had previously been screened for either breast or prostate cancer . But the study found that about half said they would not choose to start screening if the test resulted in more than one overtreated person per one cancer death averted .Wow . That implies that millions of Americans might choose not to be screened if they knew the whole story â that overtreatment is typically more common than avoiding a cancer death .Is the survey right ? Honestly , I have no idea . Different surveys get different answers . According to surveys , most of us hate Obamacare . But a number of us like the Affordable Care Act ( another name for the same thing ) . And most of us like the bulk of the individual components of the law . How you ask the question matters .Similarly , how Americans feel about screening is obviously related to what they are told about screening . Most of the time they get a simple message : Itâs the most important thing they can do to stay healthy . Occasionally , they may hear just the opposite : Itâs dangerous . The truth is , itâs neither .Instead , itâs a close call . Different people in the same situation can rationally make different choices . But first , patients need some quantification of the benefits and harms .In a study to be published Monday , Dec. 30 in JAMA Internal Medicine , a colleague and I attempt to provide that data for women making the choice about screening mammography . Letâs be clear at the outset : There is a lot of uncertainty â and professional disagreement â about what the data are . So we provide a range of estimates , from optimistic to pessimistic .There is no doubt that screening mammography in the United States leads to a lot of false alarms . Among a thousand 50-year-old American women screened annually for a decade , how many will have at least one false alarm ? Our estimate ranges from 490 to 670 . The data come from the mammographers themselves â the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium â and reflect radiologists who deliver low and high rates of false alarms ( those in the 25th and 75th percentiles ) .A screening program that falsely alarms about half the population is outrageous . To be sure , many women are quickly reassured by a second test that their breast is normal . But others â while told they donât have cancer â are told that their breast is somehow abnormal , that they have dysplasia or atypia , that they are at âhigh risk.â Whether you blame the doctors or the system or the malpractice lawyers , itâs a problem that needs to be fixed .Then there is the problem of overdiagnosis : the detection of a âcancerâ that was not destined to ever cause problems . Overdiagnosis is what leads to overtreatment . A decade ago doctors debated whether this problem existed in breast cancer . Now the debate is about how often it occurs .In a pamphlet to help women decide about mammography screening in Britain , the National Health Service now explicitly tells women that their chance of overdiagnosis is about three times higher than their chance of avoiding a breast-cancer death . I canât tell you if that is the right estimate ; since most everyone who receives a diagnosis of âcancerâ is treated , overdiagnosis is rarely observed directly , so it is notoriously difficult to quantify . But I can tell you itâs in the ballpark . Our optimistic/pessimistic finding is this : Among a thousand 50-year-old American women screened annually for a decade , 3 to 14 will be overdiagnosed and overtreated .What about the benefit ? Among those thousand women , 3.2 to 0.3 will avoid a breast-cancer death . If you donât like decimals , call it 3 to 0 .The optimistic estimate reflects the most favorable result of the nine most comprehensive randomized trials of breast cancer screening . But these trials were initiated 20 to 50 years ago . Whether their results are still relevant is a question . Because of substantial improvements in breast cancer treatment , many cancers that would have been deadly 20 years ago now no longer are . The better we are able to treat cancer , the less important it is find it early ; in other words , there are fewer deaths for screening to help avoid . This is what is reflected in the pessimistic estimate . One study comparing regions with similar populations and health care systems , but different screening policies ( like Sweden versus Norway and Northern Ireland versus the Republic of Ireland ) , found that breast cancer death rates had declined at similar rates , regardless of when mass screening was adopted .So put it all together . Among a thousand 50-year-old American women screened annually for a decade , 3.2 to 0.3 will avoid a breast cancer death , 490 to 670 will have at least one false alarm and 3 to 14 will be overdiagnosed and treated needlessly . That may help some women choose whether to be screened or not . But itâs still not very precise , and it doesnât answer the fundamental question : Now that treatment is so much better , how much benefit does screening actually provide ? What we need is a clinical trial in the current treatment era .Two randomized trials could begin to answer the central question of mammography interpretation : How hard should the radiologist look ? Women who view mammography favorably might be willing to be screened under either the current approach or a high-threshold approach â meaning their radiologist would ignore small , likely harmless abnormalities found on a mammogram.Those who view it less favorably might choose that high-threshold approach ( knowing that the harms of false alarms and overdiagnosis would be minimized ) or forgo mammography completely .Putting the two trials together , we could finally learn what level of screening minimizes false alarms and overdiagnosis while saving the most lives . Most experts would say that itâs never going to happen . It would cost too much , take too long and need too many subjects .Maybe they are right . But maybe not . Sure , it would cost millions of dollars . But thatâs chicken feed compared with the billions of dollars we spend on breast cancer screening every year . Sure , it would take 10 to 15 years . But it would help our daughters know more . Sure , it would take tens of thousands of women to participate . But maybe they would want to be part of the effort to help sort out the morass surrounding what is one of the most common medical interventions done to American women .You never know , until you ask .None of this should dissuade women from seeking a diagnosis when they develop a new breast lump ( thatâs a form of early diagnosis we all agree on ) or from seeking treatment for a diagnosed breast cancer ( better treatment , not early detection , is the real success story in breast cancer ) . The uncertainties are about screening . Women who want to reduce those uncertainties will have to participate in trials .
THIS week is the 50th anniversary of the publication of Betty Friedanâs international best seller , âThe Feminine Mystique , â which has been widely credited with igniting the womenâs movement of the 1960s . Readers who return to this feminist classic today are often puzzled by the absence of concrete political proposals to change the status of women . But âThe Feminine Mystiqueâ had the impact it did because it focused on transforming womenâs personal consciousness .In 1963 , most Americans did not yet believe that gender equality was possible or even desirable . Conventional wisdom held that a woman could not pursue a career and still be a fulfilled wife or successful mother . Normal women , psychiatrists proclaimed , renounced all aspirations outside the home to meet their feminine need for dependence . In 1962 , more than two-thirds of the women surveyed by University of Michigan researchers agreed that most important family decisions âshould be made by the man of the house.âIt was in this context that Friedan set out to transform the attitudes of women . Arguing that âthe personal is political , â feminists urged women to challenge the assumption , at work and at home , that women should always be the ones who make the coffee , watch over the children , pick up after men and serve the meals .Over the next 30 years this emphasis on equalizing gender roles at home as well as at work produced a revolutionary transformation in Americansâ attitudes . It was not instant . As late as 1977 , two-thirds of Americans believed that it was âmuch better for everyone involved if the man is the achiever outside the home and the woman takes care of the home and family.â By 1994 , two-thirds of Americans rejected this notion .But during the second half of the 1990s and first few years of the 2000s , the equality revolution seemed to stall . Between 1994 and 2004 , the percentage of Americans preferring the male breadwinner/female homemaker family model actually rose to 40 percent from 34 percent . Between 1997 and 2007 , the number of full-time working mothers who said they would prefer to work part time increased to 60 percent from 48 percent . In 1997 , a quarter of stay-at-home mothers said full-time work would be ideal . By 2007 , only 16 percent of stay-at-home mothers wanted to work full time . ÂWomenâs labor-force participation in the United States also leveled off in the second half of the 1990s , in contrast to its continued increase in most other countries . Gender desegregation of college majors and occupations slowed . And although single mothers continued to increase their hours of paid labor , there was a significant jump in the percentage of married women , especially married women with infants , who left the labor force . By 2004 , a smaller percentage of married women with children under 3 were in the labor force than in 1993 .SOME people began to argue that feminism was not about furthering the equal involvement of men and women at home and work but simply about giving women the right to choose between pursuing a career and devoting themselves to full-time motherhood . A new emphasis on intensive mothering and attachment parenting helped justify the latter choice .Anti-feminists welcomed this shift as a sign that most Americans did not want to push gender equality too far . And feminists , worried that they were seeing a resurgence of traditional gender roles and beliefs , embarked on a new round of consciousness-raising . Books with titles like âThe Feminine Mistakeâ and âGet to Workâ warned of the stiff penalties women paid for dropping out of the labor force , even for relatively brief periods . Cultural critics questioned the âPerfect Madnessâ of intensive mothering and helicopter parenting , noting the problems that resulted when , as Ms. Friedan had remarked about âhousewifery , â mothering âexpands to fill the time available.âOne study cautioned that nearly 30 percent of opt-out moms who wanted to rejoin the labor force were unable to do so , and of those who did return , only 40 percent landed full-time professional jobs . In âThe Price of Motherhood , â the journalist Ann Crittenden estimated that the typical college-educated woman lost more than $ 1 million dollars in lifetime earnings and forgone retirement benefits after she opted out .Other feminists worried that the equation of feminism with an individual womanâs choice to opt out of the work force undermined the movementâs commitment to a larger vision of gender equity and justice . Joan Williams , the founding director of the Center for WorkLife Law at the University of Californiaâs Hastings College of the Law , argued that defining feminism as giving mothers the choice to stay home assumes that their partners have the responsibility to support them , and thus denies choice to fathers . The political theorist Lori Marso noted that emphasizing personal choice ignores the millions of women without a partner who can support them .
WASHINGTON — When the Supreme Court issued its latest campaign finance decision last month , the justices lined up in a familiar way . The five appointed by Republican presidents voted for the Republican National Committee , which was a plaintiff . The four appointed by Democrats dissented .That 5-to-4 split along partisan lines was by contemporary standards unremarkable . But by historical standards it was extraordinary . For the first time , the Supreme Court is closely divided along party lines .The partisan polarization on the court reflects similarly deep divisions in Congress , the electorate and the elite circles in which the justices move .The deep and often angry divisions among the justices are but a distilled version of the way American intellectuals — at think tanks and universities , in opinion journals and among the theorists and practitioners of law and politics — have separated into two groups with vanishingly little overlap or interaction . It is a recipe for dysfunction .The perception that partisan politics has infected the court’s work may do lasting damage to its prestige and authority and to Americans’ faith in the rule of law .“An undesirable consequence of the court’s partisan divide , ” said Justin Driver , a law professor at the University of Texas , “is that it becomes increasingly difficult to contend with a straight face that constitutional law is not simply politics by other means , and that justices are not merely politicians clad in fine robes . If that perception becomes pervasive among today’s law students , who will become tomorrow’s judges , after all , it could assume a self-reinforcing quality.”Presidents used to make nominations based on legal ability , to cater to religious or ethnic groups , to repay political favors or to reward friends . Even when ideology was their main concern , they often bet wrong .Three changes have created a courthouse made up of red and blue chambers . Presidents care more about ideology than they once did . They have become better at finding nominees who reliably vote according to that ideology . And party affiliation is increasingly the best way to predict the views of everyone from justices to bank tellers .It tells you more than gender , age , race or class , a 2012 Pew Research Center study found . And the gap between the parties is now larger than at any time in the survey’s 25-year history .“Polarization is higher than at any time I’ve ever seen as a citizen or studied as a student of politics , ” said Kay L. Schlozman , a political scientist at Boston College .Supreme Court nominations were never immune from political considerations . But many factors used to play a role .That is why Republican presidents routinely appointed justices who were or would turn out to be liberals . Among them were Chief Justice Earl Warren and Justices William J. Brennan Jr. and Harry A. Blackmun .But it has been almost 25 years since the last such appointment , of Justice David H. Souter in 1990 . And it has been more than 50 years since a Democratic president last appointed a justice who often voted with the court’s conservatives : Justice Byron R. White , who was nominated by President John F. Kennedy in 1962 .That timeline may suggest more ideological rigidity among Democratic presidents . But the number of opportunities played a role , too , as there have been twice as many Republican appointments since 1953 . And Republican justices were until recently more apt than Democratic ones to drift away from the positions of the presidents who appointed them .The new era arrived with the last retirement , in 2010 . Justice John Paul Stevens , a liberal appointed by President Gerald R. Ford , a Republican , left the court . Justice Elena Kagan , a liberal appointed by President Obama , arrived .Now , just as there is no Democratic senator who is more conservative than the most liberal Republican , there is no Democratic appointee on the Supreme Court who is more conservative than any Republican appointee . “It’s not coincidence , ” said Lawrence Baum , a political scientist at Ohio State , “that the court is now divided along partisan lines in a way that hasn’t been true.”The partisan split is likely to deepen , said Neal Devins , a law professor at William & Mary and an author , along with Professor Baum , of a study examining , as its subtitle put it , “how party polarization turned the Supreme Court into a partisan court.”Consider , Professor Devins said , the eventual retirement of Justice Anthony M. Kennedy , a Republican appointee who sits at the court’s ideological center and joins the court’s four-member liberal wing about a third of the time when it divides along partisan lines .“When Kennedy leaves , ” Professor Devins said , “it’s going to move the court a whole , whole lot to the left , if the president is a Democrat , or slightly to the right , if it’s a Republican.”THESE days , candidates for the court are groomed for decades and subjected to intense vetting . They are often affiliated with the networks of conservative or liberal lawyers that have replaced more neutral groups like bar associations . And they are drawn more than ever from federal appeals courts , where their views can be closely scrutinized .Confirmation battles have grown more partisan . With the exception of Justice Clarence Thomas , the five most senior members of the current court were confirmed easily , receiving an average of three negative votes . The four more recent nominees received an average of 33 .Once on the court , the justices surround themselves with like-minded law clerks , consume news reports that reinforce their views and appear before sympathetic audiences .In their public statements , the justices reject the idea that their work is influenced by politics . They point out that their decisions were unanimous almost half the time in the term that ended in June 2013 , and that the roughly 30 percent of 5-to-4 decisions did not all feature the classic alignments of Justice Kennedy joining either the court’s conservative wing or its liberal one .But that was how most of the closely divided decisions came out . The conservatives won 10 times , including a decision striking down a core provision of the Voting Rights Act . The liberals won six times , including a ruling requiring the federal government to provide benefits to married same-sex couples .There are notable exceptions , of course , starting with Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. 's 2012 vote to uphold the heart of the Affordable Care Act .But standard political-science measurements of ideology , based on many thousands of votes , confirm the rise of a court divided on partisan lines .The very question of partisan voting hardly arose until 1937 , as dissents on the Supreme Court were infrequent . When the justices did divide , it was seldom along party lines .There is room for interpretation in such assessments . But of the 71 cases from 1790 to 1937 deemed important by a standard reference work and in which there were at least two dissenting votes , only one broke by party affiliation . “The dividing line in the court was not a party line , ” Zechariah Chafee , a law professor at Harvard , wrote in a classic 1941 book .Nonpartisan voting patterns held true until 2010 , with a brief exception in the early 1940s , when a lone Republican appointee voted to the right of eight Democratic appointees . But the general trend was the same . Of the 311 cases listed as important from 1937 to 2010 with at least two dissents , only one of them , in 1985 , even arguably broke along party lines .That adds up to two cases in more than two centuries . By contrast , in just the last three terms , there were five major decisions that were closely divided along partisan lines : the ones on the Voting Rights Act , campaign finance , arbitration , immigration and strip-searches . In the current term , last month’s campaign finance ruling and Monday’s decision on legislative prayer fit the pattern , too .MANY factors seem to contribute to partisan polarization on the court , including the people who work most closely with the justices .Every year , the justices each hire four recent law students , mostly from a handful of elite law schools . They consider grades , recommendations and , in recent years , a political marker .In the last nine terms , the court’s current Republican appointees hired clerks who had first served for appeals court judges appointed by Republicans at least 83 percent of the time . Justice Thomas hired one clerk from a Democratic judge’s chambers , Justice Scalia none .The numbers on the other side are almost as striking . Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg , Sonia Sotomayor and Kagan hired from Democratic chambers more than two-thirds of the time . Justice Stephen G. Breyer is the exception : His hiring has long been about evenly divided .When law clerks move on , their career paths seem subject to the gravitational pull of ideology . Clerks for justices appointed by Democrats work for Democratic administrations , law firm practices headed by former Democratic officials and law schools dominated by liberals . Clerks for Republican appointees often go in the opposite directions .All of this is new , according to a detailed study in the Vanderbilt Law Review . “The Supreme Court clerkship appeared to be a nonpartisan institution from the 1940s into the 1980s , ” it said .Like the rest of the country , the justices increasingly rely on sources of information that reinforce their views .“We just get The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Times , ” Justice Scalia told New York magazine in September . He canceled his subscription to The Washington Post , he said , because it was “slanted and often nasty” and “shrilly liberal.” He said he did not read The New York Times either .“I get most of my news , probably , driving back and forth to work , on the radio , ” he said . “Talk guys , usually.”Before the political and social culture of Washington grew polarized , most of the justices moved in a mixed and often liberal milieu . “The social atmosphere in Washington had a role in the leftward movement of some of the justices , ” Professor Baum said .Those days are over , Justice Scalia said . “When I was first in Washington , and even in my early years on this court , I used to go to a lot of dinner parties at which there were people from both sides , ” he said . “Katharine Graham used to have dinner parties that really were quite representative of Washington . It doesn’t happen anymore.”In a recent 10-year period , the justices made around 1,000 public appearances for which their expenses were reimbursed , which generally means they were outside Washington . They almost certainly made at least as many local appearances . But their audiences varied . Justices Scalia , Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. have addressed the Federalist Society , a conservative group , while Justices Stevens , Ginsburg and Breyer spoke to the American Constitution Society , a liberal group . Justice Sotomayor is a featured speaker at its national convention next month .Justice Kagan , appearing before the Federalist Society in 2005 when she was dean of the Harvard Law School , said she admired its work . But , she added , “you are not my people.”
Cambridge , Mass .THERE must be an election coming up . I know this because of the number of times I have been getting a certain e-mail , one that begins , “Take the three minutes to read this . Maybe he is wrong , but what if he’s right ? ” I first received the e-mail — which includes an essay railing against President Obama and the Federal Reserve — back in March 2009 , just weeks after the president’s inauguration . Since then , 267 people have e-mailed me about it ; about two dozen more have called my office to talk about it . A vast majority of them agree with the essay’s sentiments and want to compliment me for my work .The essay , which has been promoted on blogs across the Internet , is attributed to a person named David Kaiser . As it happens , my name is David Kaiser . We are not the same person . In fact , the e-mail states clearly that it was written by a historian and “professor in the Strategy and Policy Department of the United States Naval War College.” Some versions included a photo of this David Kaiser , taken from his Wikipedia entry . I teach physics and the history of science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , and my Web site includes a photograph of myself right next to my e-mail address . We look nothing alike .The essay includes a short curriculum vitae for the professor ( now retired from the Naval War College ) , the names of several of his books and his prior teaching appointments . Each of those items is true , except for one detail : that David Kaiser did not write it , either .After the false attribution , the essay launches into a tirade against the president that culminates in a comparison between him and Adolf Hitler . There are elementary flaws throughout — Winston Churchill never served in the British House of Lords , for one — piled on top of outlandish claims like the one that Mr. Obama promised to “create and fund a mandatory civilian defense force stronger than our military for use inside our borders.” In between are sneering gibes at religious minorities , schoolteachers and supporters of same-sex marriage .The rate at which the essay lands in my in-box follows the political news cycle . About one e-mail arrived each day during April and May 2009 , when the stimulus plan and the auto-industry bailout were in the headlines . Then the traffic fell by half until the pitched battles over the Affordable Care Act : I received about twice as many e-mails about the essay during September 2009 as I did at the peak period of the previous spring . Again there followed a brief quiescence until the Congressional election of 2010 . After each of those spikes , I foolishly thought that the episode had run its course . But no : with each new round of partisan finger-pointing in Washington , my in-box would fill up again .One concerned citizen wrote to me : “I just got an e-mail that I believe you authored and I agree with every word . Now , what do we do to stop this ? ” Another wrote , “All I can say is keep up the good work until the ‘brown shirts’ come along with a wide sweeping ‘Fairness doctrine’ to shut you down.” A year later one satisfied reader greeted me , “Hello , ‘soul mate’ ! ” This past July someone e-mailed to thank me for the essay , adding : “It is time for people to speek [ sic ] out and voice their thoughts and findings on Obama . Facts are facts.” Several correspondents have requested permission to reprint “my” essay in their local newspaper . Others clearly have had tastes that run beyond the mainstream media , like the reader who opined , “this country has been under the control of satanic , antichrist powers — not government.”I first wrote to the other David Kaiser about the essay at the end of March 2009 . He confirmed that he had not written it , either , that it absolutely did not represent his views , and that he was also being inundated . Neither of us had any idea how to get our names off it .By the first week of April 2009 , fact-checking Web sites like snopes.com had declared the essay’s attributed authorship to be bogus . According to Snopes , the real provenance of the essay was an anonymous comment on a blog . By that time , I had received precisely 11 e-mails about it . More than 250 e-mails arrived after it had been publicly declared a hoax . And that’s what troubles me . The essay falls in a beguiling category : the zombie fact , claims that are shown to be untrue but which simply will not die .
THE Postal Serviceâs announcement that it plans to end Saturday mail delivery reminds us of its vulnerability to the technological convulsions of the information age . The agency lost nearly $ 16 billion last year ; stopping Saturday delivery , starting in August , would save about $ 2 billion a year . To preserve the letter of the law , which requires six-day service , the agency would continue Saturday parcel delivery â a shrewd decision , since , thanks to booming e-commerce , the parcel business is one of the few sectors that is actually growing .Polls suggest that 7 in 10 Americans support the change , but a predictable outcry has emerged from members of Congress , labor unions , periodical publishers and direct-mail marketers . Other critics warn that ceasing Saturday service will be the first step down an irreversible âdeath spiral.âThe controversy gets at a more fundamental question : Do we want the mail to remain a vital American institution in the digital age ?When Americans reflect on postal history , they almost always start with Benjamin Franklin . But Franklin had nothing to do with the modern institution that the founders established . It was George Washington and James Madison , not Franklin , who supported the key legislation that got the modern post office up and running in 1792 .By then Franklin had been dead for two years ; the post office he briefly oversaw in 1775-6 was basically a carbon copy of the British imperial post . The mandate of Franklinâs post office was narrow ; its primary rationale was to sustain the fledging revolutionary movement .In contrast , the Post Office Act of 1792 , with a broad civic mandate , vastly expanded the postal network while admitting newspapers into the mail at an extremely low rate . No less impressively , it guaranteed the sanctity of personal correspondence by protecting letters from the prying eyes of government . In a stroke , the founders provided the entire population with low-cost access to information on public affairs , while establishing a right to personal privacy .The results were astounding . Alexis de Tocqueville marveled at the skill with which postal administrators circulated hefty bundles of newspapers from New York and Philadelphia to the wilds of Detroit , then a thinly populated outpost on the western frontier . To his eyes , the post office was the only entity with the organizational capability to circulate the information of public significance that was essential to sustain Americaâs bold experiment with democracy . The German-born philosopher Francis Lieber called it an âelement of civilizationâ â worthy of comparison with the printing press and the marinerâs compass .Saturday delivery started in 1863 , after the departure from Congress of anti-urban Southern states in rebellion . Northern legislators instituted free city delivery , thereby creating the modern letter carrier . Before then , Americans almost always picked up their mail at the post office â even on Sundays , if they wished â just as they can today if they rent a post office box .Of course , radio , television and the Internet have irrevocably altered our information-gathering habits , and the post office is no longer the wellspring of democracy it once was . The volume of first-class mail has long been declining as more Americans use e-mail and pay their bills online . Neither junk mail â bizarrely called âstandard mailâ in postal jargon â nor parcels have been able to pick up the slack .Though it still delivers millions of periodicals â whose low-cost circulation the founders would have heartily endorsed â and countless direct-mail solicitations for businesses , charities and political campaigns , very few Americans get their newspapers in the mail . Even so , by coordinating the circulation of billions of letters , parcels and even so-called junk mail , it helps sustain the social fabric .The millions of parcels that the Postal Service delivers reliably and at low cost provide a salutary check on the pricing policies of FedEx and U.P.S . Wonder why the lines at the post office are so long ? Itâs because it still provides a service at a cost no rival can match . ( Moreover , the agency already works with FedEx and U.P.S . to keep mail delivery affordable . In hundreds of cities and towns , it delivers the âlast mileâ parcels that FedEx and U.P.S . transport through their hub-and-spoke airborne networks . )Relatively few city dwellers go to the post office to pick up their mail , but in countless hamlets and small towns , the local post office remains a vital community center . For millions of workers , including veterans and African-Americans , a job at the post office has been a ticket to the middle class and has provided a pension and medical care to retirees . The Postal Service is the countryâs second largest civilian employer , after Walmart .Postal correspondence is far more secure than e-mail and far less vulnerable to cyberattack . By capitalizing on its expertise in scheduling and high-volume sorting , the Postal Service has the potential to become a big platform for digital commerce . It helped pioneer optical character recognition , now a widely used technology . But Congress and regulations have frustrated the post office from issuing secure e-mail addresses and expanding by providing same-day service for digital retailers , for example , while obliging it to bankroll money-losing operations like six-day delivery .Postmaster General Patrick R. Donahoe announced in 2011 that the Postal Service would substantially reduce overnight delivery for first-class mail , considering closing up to 252 of 487 mail-processing facilities , make bookkeeping changes involving pensions and shrink the work force . Together with ending Saturday delivery , those steps might restore solvency by 2015 .In 1899 , Postmaster General Charles Emory Smith called the post office the âgreatest business concern in the world.â He had it wrong . The post office is a public service with a civic mandate central to American business , society and civic culture â not a business . But if it is to survive , Congress must allow it to start acting like one .
BRAD CRELIA was rushing around the vast media room at an international AIDS conference last summer in Washington , interviewing people for a series of articles on Hivster.com , a Web magazine he founded for people who are H.I.V . positive . The ease with which he moved through the crowd made it clear he’d done this kind of political networking before : he’d worked first as a field organizer for Hillary Rodham Clinton and later as a regional field organizer for President Obama .But Mr. Crelia , 27 , nearly didn’t make it home from the AIDS conference ; without the $ 17 necessary to buy a bus ticket , he’d had to beg a stranger for a ride back to New York . It was the end of the month , he said . He’d simply run out of money .He is one of more than 8.7 million disabled Americans who rely on cash assistance from the government through a program called Supplemental Security Income . The program was created in 1974 to help blind , aged and disabled people meet basic needs for food , clothing and shelter . By 2035 , the federal government expects to spend $ 60.9 billion in payments to 9.9 million people .Discussion of Medicare , Medicaid and Social Security programs has been at the forefront of election-year debate . But there has been no discussion of S.S.I . The fact is that expenditures for the S.S.I . program are rising while the economic status of disabled people is on the decline .The very program that is supposed to be their safety net is actually the source of the problem , experts say . S.S.I . traps many disabled people by limiting their income to levels just above the poverty line , and taking away their cash benefits if they achieve any level of security .At 16 , Mr. Crelia was given a diagnosis of porphyria , an incurable hereditary blood disorder . His symptoms — seizures , paralysis , blackouts , nausea and extreme pain — became more and more severe , preventing him from finishing college and landing him in the hospital for days or weeks at a time . In addition , in 2009 , he learned he had H.I.V . That has not affected his ability to work . But his porphyria has made maintaining a traditional full-time job nearly impossible .So he and others like him need a flexible financial safety net for the periods during which they can not work . But no such program exists . The only way for Mr. Crelia to qualify for cash assistance was to sign up for S.S.I . — and demonstrate that he was unable to “engage in substantial gainful activity” because of his physical impairment .He now receives a monthly check for $ 506 through the S.S.I . program , and he is allowed to earn $ 85 more . ( He also receives some assistance toward his rent and food expenses . ) Once he surpasses the $ 85 , his benefit check will be reduced by $ 1 for every $ 2 he earns . And if his income reaches $ 1,097 a month , he will no longer be eligible for any cash S.S.I . benefits at all . So he must be poor or he must give up all government support . Mr. Crelia is never permitted to have more than $ 2,000 in the bank , a restriction that places the trappings of a middle-class life — a car , a modest home , a family — far out of reach .“I’ve been kept financially sort of in this cage , ” Mr. Crelia said . “Just basic things that people rely upon , having a normal life , aren’t things that are really accessible . And won’t be.”People like Mr. Crelia — ill , but ambitious , motivated and able to work the majority of the time — don’t fit into a rigid system set up primarily to provide support for those who will never be able to enter the workplace in any capacity . Instead of accounting for a spectrum of ability and administering a benefits package accordingly , the system offers a one-size-fits-all plan : you can either work and not qualify for financial assistance , or you’re sick , and barred from earning any substantial income .“Instead of helping people achieve their full potential , ” David Stapleton , who directs the Mathematica Center for Studying Disability Policy , testified before Congress last month , “the current disability support system has created a poverty trap.” The employment rate for people with disabilities , he said , is just 21 percent of the rate for people without disabilities , down from 32 percent in 1981 . The problems stem from the Social Security Administration’s failure in 1974 to structure a program that motivates work . It is relatively easy to accept cash benefits but very hard to get into the workplace . Mr. Stapleton said that Congress had the power to push to change the structure of the program , but that it had not done so .Today , 70 percent of people with disabilities live in poverty . The Affordable Care Act may eventually ease the burden for some individuals with disabilities , namely those who rely on Medicaid through the S.S.I . program , by eliminating exclusions based on pre-existing conditions and annual or lifetime benefits caps . But the impact on the disabled is not yet clear , and experts are calling for additional targeted reforms .Richard Burkhauser , a professor at Cornell , and Mary Daly , a government economist , have studied the welfare of people with disabilities for more than three decades , and offer some solutions . They suggest a work-first approach that would help people get job training or employment before they go through the red-tape-ridden path of getting on S.S.I . Now people must go through the lengthy process of proving that they can not work before they are given access to job training and other programs .Instead of enrolling Mr. Crelia in S.S.I. , the Social Security Administration could have helped him apply for a loan to finish his bachelor’s degree , increasing his chances of finding a flexible , high-paying job with health insurance .Mr. Burkhauser and Ms. Daly borrow another idea from the lessons learned from the 1996 welfare overhaul . Welfare moved from a federal program that did not encourage single mothers to work to a state-run program that offered the incentive of an earned-income tax credit for working mothers . They say S.S.I . should copy this model by allowing people like Mr. Crelia to hold a paying job as often as possible — whether for 20 , 25 or 30 hours a week — and having the federal or state government chip in with tax credits to round out his income .For now , Mr. Crelia is doing his best to stay busy . He clocks far more than 40 hours most weeks , mostly in unpaid writing . “When I work , I thrive both physically and emotionally , ” Mr. Crelia said . “When I am not sick and can control my disease with medication — like now — I want to be able to contribute to society , have a family , grow my business . But not as a volunteer ; I want to be paid like everyone else.”
THE chicken salad hero at Lennyâs , a chain in New York , has 213 more calories than the tuna salad on the same kind of bread . I did no research to bring you this information . On the big menu board at the Lennyâs around the corner from me , where I sometimes grab a perfunctory lunch , the calorie counts of every item are clearly posted . The city made this mandatory for such restaurants about five years ago , hoping that informed gluttons might be reformed gluttons : that if we had more knowledge about where our efforts to slim down were going wrong , weâd have more power to change them .And yet four out of every five lunches at Lennyâs , I get the chicken salad , all 879 calories of it , because thereâs something more persuasive than nutritional data . Itâs called mayonnaise . I can taste it in the chicken salad but not in the leaner tuna , partly explaining the extra damage â and the exaggerated sirenâs call â of the former . The stomach wants what it wants , even if the love handles pay a pendulous price for it .McMuffin by McMuffin , Frosty by Frosty , we Americans are waddling toward the moment when calorie counts like the ones at Lennyâs are posted in every chain restaurant across the nation . Starbucks , which already advertises such information in cities that require it , announced last week that it would do so throughout the country before the end of this month , a recognition that the clock was ticking anyway . As part of the Affordable Care Act , any restaurant in America with at least 20 locations must follow Starbucksâs lead , perhaps next year . ( The precise date hasnât been fixed . )Soon enough , those of us taking in more calories than we should be and wearing pants roomier than weâd like to wonât be able to say we werenât told . But is ignorance really our enemy , or are appetite , compulsion and ingrained habit the chief culprits ?These arenât just idle questions but matters of immediate relevance in the war against obesity , the stakes of which were just raised . On the same day last week that Starbucks made its announcement , the American Medical Association voted to classify obesity as a disease . This means that in the eyes of the largest physiciansâ group in the United States , the roughly 90 million Americans who are formally considered obese â thatâs about 30 percent of the population â arenât just in imperfect health . Theyâre downright ill , and we need to heal them .Calorie postings are one of public health officialsâ attempts to do that . The results so far arenât especially encouraging .Brian Elbel , a population-health expert at New York Universityâs school of medicine , examined fast-food receipts from four chains in New York both before the city law went into effect and after , to see if customers were altering their orders to reduce the calories they consumed per visit to the restaurants . He found no meaningful difference , and his subsequent research in Philadelphia , which in 2010 implemented a mandate like New Yorkâs , echoes and bolsters that conclusion .âItâs becoming increasingly clear that nothing big is happening for a large group of people , â Elbel told me .Other evidence isnât quite so grim . New York City commissioned a broader survey than Elbelâs , looking at thousands of receipts from 11 chains . At three of them â Au Bon Pain , KFC and McDonaldâs â there was proof of calorie reductions after the law . But at seven there wasnât , and at Subway , which was promoting footlong sandwiches for $ 5 during the post-law survey period , calorie consumption per visit actually increased .âThe effect of calorie counts is beneficial , â Thomas Farley , the cityâs health commissioner , said during a phone interview on Friday . âBut itâs small and somewhat spotty and can be overwhelmed by the marketing of the restaurant.âYet another study , confined to Starbucks stores in New York , noted a 6 percent decrease in customersâ intake of calories after the posting began . But it also suggested some vexing limitations to the impact of advertised calorie counts .âCalorie reductions were highest in high-income , high-education neighborhoods ( where we believe obesity rates to be lower ) , â Phillip Leslie , one of the studyâs authors , said to me in an e-mail . On top of which , the Starbucks customers as an overall group were more affluent than the fast-food customers whose unchanged behavior Elbel evaluated . âIt raises a very important concern , â said Leslie , an economist at the University of California , Los Angeles . âThe people who tend to be most responsive to information may be those we least aim to target.âBRYAN BOLLINGER , who also worked on that study , drew my attention to something else in it . For the most part , Starbucks customers ordering sugary , creamy coffee beverages kept on doing so , seemingly because they had already figured that the drinks were fattening and had made a flabby peace with that . But customers indeed adjusted their food orders upon realizing that a pastry could easily exceed 400 calories . They hadnât bargained on , or planned for , that .âWhat really matters is what your prior beliefs are , â said Bollinger , who teaches marketing at New York Universityâs Stern School of Business .What also matters is how much of a nudge youâre given .Cheryl Healton , the dean of global public health at New York University , told me that education and information could be effective in influencing a discrete , relatively easy behavior , like persuading someone to get vaccinated .âBut when itâs habitual and even addictive behavior , youâre in a whole new ballgame , â she said .Healton , an authority on tobacco use in particular , noted that the principal reasons for the remarkable decrease in smoking in New York City and elsewhere over the last few decades werenât ominous commercials and warning labels . They were taxes and the bans on indoor smoking . People kicked the habit when it became onerous , in cost and convenience , not to .Farley , the health commissioner , agreed . âThe structural things were more effective for smoking than the information was , â he said . And that â not any itch to play nanny â is why he and Mayor Michael Bloomberg support such measures as new taxes on sodas , which may never happen , and a ban on sugary drinks over 16 ounces , which is in legal limbo .We should certainly continue to give posted calorie counts a whirl . Even a tiny impact is better than none . But we also need a more forceful kick in our amply cushioned rears . Weâre not as plump as we are because weâve never had our eyes opened to the wages of a Whopper . Weâre this way because itâs all too easy , in a pang of hunger and collapse of resolve , to turn a blind eye to the toll . I know whereof I speak . My neighborhood Lennyâs does , too .
WHEN a federal judge recently ordered the Food and Drug Administration to make the morning-after pill available to women of all ages without a prescription , the ruling was a political embarrassment for the Obama administration and unleashed protests from abortion foes and abstinence advocates . But that controversy may look like a tempest in a teapot compared with a broader and no less heated discussion that is roiling the medical community : should birth-control pills of any type require a doctor’s prescription ? Or should they be available , like Tylenol , on pharmacy shelves ?Last December the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists released an official position paper concluding that the time had come for birth-control pills to be sold over the counter . It was the first time the group had endorsed such sales , concluding that scientific evidence suggested that the practice was safe and calling it “a potential way to improve contraceptive access and use , and possibly decrease the unintended pregnancy rate.”After all , oral contraceptives have been available in the United States for more than half a century , and few medicines have been so thoroughly vetted . Despite some catchy new brand names , the pills I took 25 years ago are essentially the same as those my daughter takes today . If anything , pills have become safer because they contain lower doses of estrogen .While oral contraceptives bring with them some tiny risks , especially if used improperly , they arguably pose fewer dangers than many other medicines bought freely at the pharmacy , experts say , including nonsteroidal pain pills like Motrin ( which can cause stomach bleeding ) and decongestants like Sudafed ( which may raise blood pressure ) . With a simple packaging insert about proper use and precautions , women would be fully capable of using them safely , the gynecologists’ group maintained .“Nonsteroidal medicines kill far more people than birth-control pills , ” said Dr. Eve Espey , a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of New Mexico , who was involved in writing the position paper . “For most women , the absolute risk of taking the pill is far less than the risks incurred in pregnancy.”The goal of the proposal , of course , is to make birth-control pills more readily available . “The biggest barrier to adherence is the logistics of a prescription — you run out on a Saturday night , you lose your pills , you go on vacation , you can’t get a doctor’s appointment , ” said Daniel Grossman , a gynecologist who is a vice president at Ibis Reproductive Health , a nonprofit research organization .In his group’s studies , about one-third of the women who were using no birth control or a less effective method said they would use the pill if it were available without a prescription . “This is what women want , ” Dr. Grossman added .But pregnancy , prescriptions and religious politics form a combustible mix in the United States , and Lo/Ovral is not likely to be next to the Tylenol anytime soon .While women’s health advocates gleefully called the American College’s endorsement “a game changer” in the quest for over-the-counter sales of birth-control pills , members of the Catholic Medical Association lambasted the idea .Gynecologists themselves seem divided on the issue . A recent poll found that a majority of gynecologists and family doctors in training opposed the practice , worried mainly about safety . The researchers at the University of Missouri who conducted the survey concluded that the fear was irrational , revealing “a knowledge deficit” about “the safety of oral contraceptives.”But Dr. Donna Harrison , executive director of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists , said her group believed that it was “foolish to make these medicines available over the counter” because of the potential for misuse and also because the practice served to abandon and isolate younger women who needed a doctor’s counsel . She cited studies showing that women who had ready access to over-the-counter emergency contraception had higher rates of sexually transmitted diseases .The political response has been even more topsy-turvy . Gov . Bobby Jindal of Louisiana , a Republican who opposes abortion , endorsed the American College’s proposal , saying that contraception was a personal issue .Meanwhile , the F.D.A . will not comment on the idea because of the “ongoing legal issues” concerning the judicial ruling on the morning-after pill , Plan B , said Stephanie Yao , a spokeswoman . The morning-after pill , also known as emergency contraception , contains the same hormones as some birth-control pills , though delivered in a short blast and higher dose .That legal dispute has highlighted the Obama administration’s hair splitting over the sensitive issue of contraceptive policy . Even though F.D.A . doctors said in 2011 that studies showed that it was safe to sell Plan B , the most common emergency contraceptive , to adolescents over the counter , the administration refused to approve the practice . ( It was already available to older women . ) That set the stage for the ruling earlier this month by Judge Edward R. Korman of the Eastern District of New York , who called the administration’s action “politically motivated and scientifically unjustified” — essentially an attempt to appease religious conservatives .Politics aside , there are procedural hurdles to clear before packs of birth-control pills can be sold without prescription . First of all , a drug maker would most likely have to apply to the F.D.A . to make the switch . At the very least , that would involve serious investment in studies to show that patients could understand labels and use the pills as directed . And over-the-counter sales could upend drug company profits . After all , some oral prescription contraceptives sell for close to $ 100 a month , with insurers paying the bulk of the costs , while generic pills cost under $ 10 .Dr. Espey said gynecologists might resist for financial reasons as well , since young women often visit the gynecologist annually solely for the purpose of getting a contraceptive prescription . ( Pap smears , which used to be recommended once a year , are now advised only once every three . ) “They worry that if patients can go to the pharmacy and get their pills , they will have fewer visits , ” she said .As for safety , the most common birth-control pill — which combines progestin with a low dose of estrogen — poses a very slightly elevated risk of blood clots and a few other conditions . But that is mostly for certain groups of women , including those with high blood pressure or those who are over 35 and smoke , for example ( these women are advised not use them ) . But warnings could be conveyed in package labeling , just as patients with a history of ulcers are advised not to take certain pain medications . And a few alternative birth-control pills that contain only progestin are generally safe for all .So far the debate has been argued in black and white . But there is , in fact , a middle ground : many countries that allow pharmacies to sell birth-control pills require that a pharmacist screen women for contraindications with a few simple questions .My daughter spends hundreds of dollars a year for a gynecologist’s visit to obtain a prescription for the same pill I got a quarter-century earlier . She goes through elaborate machinations to get them if she runs out while away on a summer job . The Affordable Care Act of 2010 seeks to improve access to the pills by eventually eliminating patient copays when prescriptions are filled . But many doctors think it would be even smarter to just eliminate the prescription .
It was an anachronistic , even silly debater’s point . New York Times v. Sullivan , decided in 1964 , and the 1971 Pentagon Papers decision ( New York Times v. United States ) of course predated the Supreme Court’s current infatuation with corporate speech and had nothing to do with the fact that newspaper publishing companies are corporations . It was the media’s role in American society , not organizational format of the publisher’s executive suite , that the justices found worthy of constitutional protection in these and other First Amendment decisions .Justice Alito , addressing a Federalist Society banquet in Washington , went on to question why “certain preferred corporations , namely those media organizations” should be accorded a favored position in the First Amendment pantheon . This may have been red meat for his conservative audience , but whatever Justice Alito’s intent , it was far from a silly point . It was a serious one , and behind it , as he went on to suggest , lies a profound question : what , today , is “the press” anyway ? It’s a question without a simple answer , either in today’s chaotic and rapidly changing media landscape or in Supreme Court doctrine .The First Amendment prohibits Congress ( and , by later interpretive expansion , the states ) from “abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press.” Do the dual references to speech and press amount to one and the same , or does the amendment place “the press” in a special position , with rights not accorded to other speakers ? The Supreme Court has never fully resolved this question .As Lee C. Bollinger , a First Amendment scholar who is president of Columbia University , notes in his recent book , “Uninhibited , Robust , and Wide-Open : A Free Press for a New Century , ” whether the press is just another speaker or a constitutionally favored one “has been a matter of active debate” on the court . Justice Potter Stewart wrote in 1975 that the Constitution’s framers must have meant to protect the press as an institution , because “if the Free Press guarantee meant no more than freedom of expression , it would be a constitutional redundancy.” But those words appeared in a law review article , not a Supreme Court opinion , and the court has generally not followed the path that Justice Stewart marked out .Potter Stewart retired from the court in 1981 , a generation ago , before blogs and links and Web sites , when news was printed on paper and it was much easier to have a discussion about “the press.” A fascinating example of just how tricky the definitional question has become is playing out these days in the Supreme Court pressroom .Since its founding 10 years ago , the Web site Scotusblog ( Scotus being the standard abbreviation for “Supreme Court of the United States” ) has become the go-to place for people interested in following the court regularly and in close to real time . And there are a lot of such people out there . On June 28 , the day the court handed down its decision in the Affordable Care Act case , the site received 5.3 million page views from one million unique users . Furthermore , unlike some more traditional media outlets , Scotusblog was error-free in promptly parsing and conveying the details of the complex decision . Its publisher , Tom Goldstein , later described the effort the site expended in covering that memorable day , in a riveting 7,000-word account that deserves a place in the how-to-do-journalism canon .Scotusblog covers the little decisions as well as the big ones . Its reporter , Lyle Denniston , draws on his 54 years of experience in covering the court ( yes , 54 , that’s not a typographical error ) to offer astute analysis of pending cases , arguments and decisions . Other staff members sift through the more than 100 new cases that reach the court each week in order to highlight the “petitions to watch” at the justices’ weekly conference . The court’s agenda-setting function is one of its most important and least transparent , yet the Supreme Court’s own Web site doesn’t post petitions . Scotusblog does , selectively , providing an invaluable service to anyone following the court from outside the building – as well as to many Supreme Court reporters whom the Scotusblog list saves from having to plow through the weekly pile of petitions on their own . Two years ago , Scotusblog won the American Bar Association’s Silver Gavel Award for media that contribute to increased public understanding of law .Twenty-seven news organizations have permanent credentials to cover the Supreme Court . Remarkably , Scotusblog is not one of them .How can this be ? We’re back to the definitional problem . The court’s public information office gives a permanent press pass only to reporters who already have credentials from the Senate Press Gallery or the White House ( and the White House , in turn , makes Senate press credentials a prerequisite for a White House press pass ) . Over the years , Scotusblog has inquired about getting Congressional credentials but has been told not to bother even submitting a formal application . Tom Goldstein and his wife , Amy Howe , started Scotusblog as a way of attracting clients to their law practice , and the link between the blog and the law firm was disqualifying under the Senate Press Gallery’s rules .The blog’s reporter at the court , Mr. Denniston , happens to have a Congressional credential through WBUR , the Boston NPR station , which grants him eligibility for a Supreme Court permanent press pass and the access and work space in the court’s press room that come with it . Some 1,000 reporters from around the country each year receive daily passes to cover individual cases , but these “day passes” come without guaranteed access to work space or an unobstructed view of the bench from the tight press quarters along the side of the courtroom . Even these temporary passes require a credential from somewhere , or some other proof of a bona fide press affiliation . For people without a pass , the press room itself is off limits . My friend Lyle Denniston is 81 years old . Without his WBUR affiliation , he would be out of luck , and it’s unclear whether , if he ever retires , Scotusblog would be able to arrange any kind of press room access .Change may just possibly be in the wind , however . Last year , Scotusblog came under the wing of Bloomberg , a properly credentialed if nontraditional news organization that is now the site’s official sponsor . I talked this week to Joe Keenan , who runs the Senate Press Gallery , to ask him whether the reconfigured Scotusblog might qualify . Quite possibly , he answered . “We’d look at them all over again , ” he said , noting that the gallery has changed substantially since my own brief stint covering Congress in the mid-1980’s . “We have all kinds of different permutations now , ” Mr. Keenan said , adding that the 24-hour news cycle has brought more journalists to Congress than ever before . The daily press gallery now accredits 1,800 reporters representing some 400 organizations , including a number of online-only publications .“Nothing is too small to cover these days , ” Mr Keenan mused . Like what ? I asked . “We had a bird fly in the window the other day , ” he replied , nearly choking with laughter , “and sure enough , someone wrote a story about it.”
A TYPICAL American school day finds some six million high school students and two million college freshmen struggling with algebra . In both high school and college , all too many students are expected to fail . Why do we subject American students to this ordeal ? I’ve found myself moving toward the strong view that we shouldn’t .My question extends beyond algebra and applies more broadly to the usual mathematics sequence , from geometry through calculus . State regents and legislators — and much of the public — take it as self-evident that every young person should be made to master polynomial functions and parametric equations .There are many defenses of algebra and the virtue of learning it . Most of them sound reasonable on first hearing ; many of them I once accepted . But the more I examine them , the clearer it seems that they are largely or wholly wrong — unsupported by research or evidence , or based on wishful logic . ( I’m not talking about quantitative skills , critical for informed citizenship and personal finance , but a very different ballgame . )This debate matters . Making mathematics mandatory prevents us from discovering and developing young talent . In the interest of maintaining rigor , we’re actually depleting our pool of brainpower . I say this as a writer and social scientist whose work relies heavily on the use of numbers . My aim is not to spare students from a difficult subject , but to call attention to the real problems we are causing by misdirecting precious resources .The toll mathematics takes begins early . To our nation’s shame , one in four ninth graders fail to finish high school . In South Carolina , 34 percent fell away in 2008-9 , according to national data released last year ; for Nevada , it was 45 percent . Most of the educators I’ve talked with cite algebra as the major academic reason .Shirley Bagwell , a longtime Tennessee teacher , warns that “to expect all students to master algebra will cause more students to drop out.” For those who stay in school , there are often “exit exams , ” almost all of which contain an algebra component . In Oklahoma , 33 percent failed to pass last year , as did 35 percent in West Virginia .Algebra is an onerous stumbling block for all kinds of students : disadvantaged and affluent , black and white . In New Mexico , 43 percent of white students fell below “proficient , ” along with 39 percent in Tennessee . Even well-endowed schools have otherwise talented students who are impeded by algebra , to say nothing of calculus and trigonometry .California’s two university systems , for instance , consider applications only from students who have taken three years of mathematics and in that way exclude many applicants who might excel in fields like art or history . Community college students face an equally prohibitive mathematics wall . A study of two-year schools found that fewer than a quarter of their entrants passed the algebra classes they were required to take .“There are students taking these courses three , four , five times , ” says Barbara Bonham of Appalachian State University . While some ultimately pass , she adds , “many drop out.”Another dropout statistic should cause equal chagrin . Of all who embark on higher education , only 58 percent end up with bachelor’s degrees . The main impediment to graduation : freshman math . The City University of New York , where I have taught since 1971 , found that 57 percent of its students didn’t pass its mandated algebra course . The depressing conclusion of a faculty report : “failing math at all levels affects retention more than any other academic factor.” A national sample of transcripts found mathematics had twice as many F’s and D’s compared as other subjects .Nor will just passing grades suffice . Many colleges seek to raise their status by setting a high mathematics bar . Hence , they look for 700 on the math section of the SAT , a height attained in 2009 by only 9 percent of men and 4 percent of women . And it’s not just Ivy League colleges that do this : at schools like Vanderbilt , Rice and Washington University in St. Louis , applicants had best be legacies or athletes if they have scored less than 700 on their math SATs .
GREENWICH , Conn.The Dow Jones and Standard & Poorâs 500 indexes reached record highs on Thursday , having completely erased the losses since the stock marketâs last peak , in 2007 . But instead of cheering , we should be very afraid .Over the last 13 years , the stock market has twice crashed and touched off a recession : American households lost $ 5 trillion in the 2000 dot-com bust and more than $ 7 trillion in the 2007 housing crash . Sooner or later â within a few years , I predict â this latest Wall Street bubble , inflated by an egregious flood of phony money from the Federal Reserve rather than real economic gains , will explode , too .Since the S. & P . 500 first reached its current level , in March 2000 , the mad money printers at the Federal Reserve have expanded their balance sheet sixfold ( to $ 3.2 trillion from $ 500 billion ) . Yet during that stretch , economic output has grown by an average of 1.7 percent a year ( the slowest since the Civil War ) ; real business investment has crawled forward at only 0.8 percent per year ; and the payroll job count has crept up at a negligible 0.1 percent annually . Real median family income growth has dropped 8 percent , and the number of full-time middle class jobs , 6 percent . The real net worth of the âbottomâ 90 percent has dropped by one-fourth . The number of food stamp and disability aid recipients has more than doubled , to 59 million , about one in five Americans .So the Main Street economy is failing while Washington is piling a soaring debt burden on our descendants , unable to rein in either the warfare state or the welfare state or raise the taxes needed to pay the nationâs bills . By default , the Fed has resorted to a radical , uncharted spree of money printing . But the flood of liquidity , instead of spurring banks to lend and corporations to spend , has stayed trapped in the canyons of Wall Street , where it is inflating yet another unsustainable bubble .When it bursts , there will be no new round of bailouts like the ones the banks got in 2008 . Instead , America will descend into an era of zero-sum austerity and virulent political conflict , extinguishing even todayâs feeble remnants of economic growth .THIS dyspeptic prospect results from the fact that we are now state-wrecked . With only brief interruptions , weâve had eight decades of increasingly frenetic fiscal and monetary policy activism intended to counter the cyclical bumps and grinds of the free market and its purported tendency to underproduce jobs and economic output . The toll has been heavy .As the federal government and its central-bank sidekick , the Fed , have groped for one goal after another â smoothing out the business cycle , minimizing inflation and unemployment at the same time , rolling out a giant social insurance blanket , promoting homeownership , subsidizing medical care , propping up old industries ( agriculture , automobiles ) and fostering new ones ( âcleanâ energy , biotechnology ) and , above all , bailing out Wall Street â they have now succumbed to overload , overreach and outside capture by powerful interests . The modern Keynesian state is broke , paralyzed and mired in empty ritual incantations about stimulating âdemand , â even as it fosters a mutant crony capitalism that periodically lavishes the top 1 percent with speculative windfalls .The culprits are bipartisan , though youâd never guess that from the blather that passes for political discourse these days . The state-wreck originated in 1933 , when Franklin D. Roosevelt opted for fiat money ( currency not fundamentally backed by gold ) , economic nationalism and capitalist cartels in agriculture and industry .Under the exigencies of World War II ( which did far more to end the Depression than the New Deal did ) , the state got hugely bloated , but remarkably , the bloat was put into brief remission during a midcentury golden era of sound money and fiscal rectitude with Dwight D. Eisenhower in the White House and William McChesney Martin Jr. at the Fed .
So Chris Christie says that Obamacare is “a failure on a number of levels” . Which levels , exactly ?I mean , first-year enrollment is above projections . The number of Americans without insurance has dropped sharply . Costs appear to be lower than expected , and more broadly cost control on health seems to be doing remarkably well:To some extent I suspect that Christie is living in the bubble ; I keep remembering how Rand Paul was shocked and disbelieving at the proposition that government employment had fallen under Obama , even though all it takes to know that is a quick look at public data .But it’s not just misinformation ; the reality doesn’t matter for Christie , or Republicans in general . Just as tax cuts can never fail , programs that help the unlucky can never succeed .
One of the odd rituals of American punditry — the most famous example is Karl Rove’s tantrum in 2012 , but it happens all the time — is the way pundits and operatives keep spinning after the polls have closed . Never mind the vote totals , and let’s dispute the network projections ; my guy is still winning !The obvious question is , what’s the point ? The votes are already in ; you can’t build momentum , or attract more donations , or any of those other things that claims of imminent victory might do . Wouldn’t election night be a good time to adopt the persona of hard-headed realist , not delusional wishful thinker ? Yet this hardly ever happens .Something like this is going on with Obamacare . Not a day goes by without some prominent Republican politician or pundit insisting that the enrollment numbers are phony , that more people are losing insurance than gaining it , etc.. I know that’s what the base believes , because it’s what they hear from Rush and Fox . But you would think that important people would have someone around who has a clue , who knows that enrollment data and multiple surveys are all telling the same story of unexpected success . OK , maybe not — if famous senators don’t have anyone to clue them in about BLS data , they might really still be living in the bubble . But that’s really their choice .And the point is that with enrollment more or less closed for 2014 , there’s not much point in spinning . OK , maybe if you can keep up the pretense all the way to November , you can slightly sway base voters for the midterms . But even that’s doubtful — by the fall , we’re going to have a very clear picture of how things went ; and the shape of that picture has already been determined .I guess that what gets me is the — to use the technical term — wussiness of it all . Isn’t there any space on the right for people who sell themselves as tough-minded , who condemn Obamacare on principle but warn their followers that it’s not on the verge of collapse ? Is the whole party so insecure , so unable to handle the truth , that it automatically shoots anyone bearing bad news ?And the answer appears to be yes .
Just a quick note in support of government statisticians . They do an incredibly important job , and by and large do it very well . They’ve also maintained a well-deserved reputation for staying out of the political fray , of acting as civil servants , not party apparatchiks .You can argue that the Census decision to change its health-insurance questionnaire starting with the 2013 data wasn’t such a good idea — in fact , I know a number of health care experts who are dismayed . But it’s really quite vile to have talk-show hosts who quite literally know nothing about the field , other than that they’re against covering the uninsured , casually accusing Census of “cooking the books” to support Obamacare .But remember , MSNBC is the liberal network , right ? Why don’t they just hire Donald Trump and be done with it ?
If you’ve been tracking the news on signups under the Affordable Care Act – which is easy thanks to Charles Gaba’s invaluable site – you already knew that the program was making a pretty good recovery from the botched start . Now , however , it’s official : as of the end of January signups were only about a million behind their projected track as of last spring , which means that as of March 31 the total is likely to be 6-point-something million rather than the projected 7 million . In other words , basically OK .But here’s the thing : every online article I’ve seen about the latest numbers is followed by a huge number of vitriolic comments insisting that it isn’t true , that Obamacare is a total disaster . Some commenters declare that all the numbers are lies ; others , getting their take from right-wing bloggers , say that all of those who have signed up but not yet paid their first premium – ahem , 47 percent of the total – will never pay and are fake enrollees . And so on .You can’t help but notice the resemblance to the “unskewing” fever of the final weeks of the 2012 election , when everyone on the right knew , just knew , that the polls showing a clear Obama edge were biased and wrong , and that if you reworked the numbers somehow they pointed to a Romney triumph .Now , you might ask , how do I know that the Obamacare unskewers are wrong ? Actually , I don’t know that for sure – but it’s very unlikely that they’re right . For one thing , they are more or less the same as the poll unskewers – people who know nothing about the subject , but know what they want to believe . For another , CBO – which has a reputation to defend – thinks it’s going to be OK . Finally , the insurers , who have real money on the line , seem fairly calm , which wouldn’t be the case if they saw really terrible enrollment .Two things are interesting about all of this . First , the right has evidently learned nothing from the unskewing debacle . And second , right-wingers are totally vested in the idea of an Obamacare collapse . They have no plan B , and their only answer to growing evidence that it’s not going to happen is furious denial .
Here and here and here .A sample:Well , I suppose some of the people who predicted doom will reconsider their views , and engage in some soul-searching about why they were so wrong — maybe even realize that they were letting their politics distort their analysis .You can stop laughing now .
The Commonwealth Fund has a new study out on Obamacare enrollment , estimating that about 9.5 million people gained coverage through Medicaid and the exchanges ; this is roughly in line with some previous estimates but perhaps slightly more encouraging for the law’s supporters . Jonathan Cohn uses the estimate to declare that the law is meeting expectations in covering the uninsured:… The Congressional Budget Office predicted that , one year into full implementation , Obamacare would reduce the the number of Americans without insurance by 12 million . That included the young adults who got insurance before 2014 , by signing onto their parents’ plans . There’s been some controversy over exactly how many more young people are insured because of that new option , but the best estimates I’ve seen place the number somewhere between 1 and 2.5 million . Add that number to the 9.5 million from the Commonwealth survey , and you’re close or equal to the CBO projections .Of course , the Commonwealth survey has a hefty margin of error and the CBO projections , revised to take account of the early technological problems on Obamacare websites , were never that scientific . But the figures seem to be in the same ballpark . That’s what matters .In broad strokes , this is plausible : Obamacare has stabilized , it’s insuring substantial numbers of people , the disaster scenarios have been averted and most people getting coverage seem reasonably happy with it . I would only offer the caveat that when Cohn says “in the same ballpark , ” he means “in the same ballpark , but probably lower than what was hoped for , which in turn was lower than what was originally projected.” That is , if the Commonwealth figure is right we’re probably looking at between 10 and 11 million newly-insured overall for 2014 ( I’m relying on “best estimates” for the number of young adults that are slightly lower than Cohn’s ) , which is lower than the 12 million the C.B.O . projected in April , which is lower than the 13 million it projected after the website problems , which is lower than the 14 million it projected after the Supreme Court decision on Medicaid , which is lower … you get the idea .All of which means that this new estimate , while useful , doesn’t really bring us any closer to knowing whether Obamacare enrollment will ultimately end up where its advocates hoped — making up ground lost during the disastrous roll-out over the next couple of years , and hitting 25-30 million newly insured by 2017 or so — or whether its current shortfalls will persist and it will end up many millions below that target .With that being said , there are other recent numbers — the surprising downward revisions on overall health care spending ( albeit revisions associated with a terrible first quarter for the economy ) , the continued downward trajectory of Medicare costs — that make it seem a little more likely that Obamacare will end up passing a different test on my recent “what count as success” list , by producing less in the way of health care cost inflation than its critics have expected . And if you throw in the suggestive data on health outcomes from the recent Massachusetts study , I think it’s entirely fair ( especially given where we were six months ago ! ) for the law’s supporters to put a glass-half-full spin on what we’re seeing at the moment — even if there’s still a long , long way to go .
Update : And exchange-based enrollments pass 6 million . Gaba now projects 6.5 million by 3/31 , and with the extensions it will go higher . The original CBO projection of 7 million now looks basically right , despite the website woes .Predictably , Republicans are in an uproar over the latest tweak to the Obamcare signups — an extension of the March 31 deadline for people who say that they tried to apply but encountered technical difficulty . As Jonathan Cohn says , the real objection here seems to be not so much that Obama is overstepping his bounds as that this will make it possible for more people to get insurance .But I also have the sense that people in the GOP are still working with a completely wrong narrative — namely , that Obamacare is failing , and that these are desperate ploys to save a sinking ship . The reality is quite different : enrollments have clearly surged in the final month . Charles Gaba is now projecting 6.4 million through the exchanges , and many more directly purchased from insurers .True , we don’t yet know how many signups were previously uninsured , and we don’t know the age/health mix of the people signing up . So we don’t know how well year one of the ACA really worked , and won’t for some time . The point , however , is that the system has evidently overcome most of its teething troubles .How will the GOP respond when the numbers come in ? If present behavior is any guide , they’ll spend months listening to “unskewers” claiming that nobody is actually going to pay for policies , or that there are untold millions who lost their insurance and can’t replace it , etc , etc.. There really isn’t any room in their worldview for the possibility that this thing might work .
Back when rate shock , website problems and lagging enrollment were threatening to unravel the new health care law before it fully took effect , I concluded a column on Obamacare’s repeated near-death experiences with the following warning to conservatives:The welfare state’s ability to defend itself against reform , however , carries a cautionary message for Obamacare’s critics as well . What isn’t killed outright grows stronger the longer it’s embedded in the federal apparatus , gaining constituents and interest-group support just by virtue of its existence even if it doesn’t work out the way it was designed . And as disastrous as its launch has been , if the health care law can survive this crisis in the same limping , staggering way it survived Scott Brown and the Supremes , then it will be a big step closer to being part of the status quo , with all the privileges and political strength that entails .So yes — it’s possible that this brush with death will be fatal , possible that the law will fall with the lightest , most politically painless push . But it’s still likely that Obamacare will be undone only if its critics are willing to do something more painful , and take their own turn wrestling with a system that resists any kind of change .With the latest numbers showing exchange enrollment climbing toward 7 million , I think we can safely retire that “possible , ” and change the “likely” to an “all-but-definite.” Not because rising enrollment proves that Obamacare is definitely working , in the sense that both its friends and critics would have originally understood the term . We don’t know yet what the paid enrollment looks like or how successfully the program is actually enrolling the uninsured . ( After some grim estimates , this Rand study is making liberals feel a little more optimistic , but still suggests a below-expectations result . ) We don’t know what the age-and-health-status composition of the enrollee pools looks like or what that means for premiums next year and beyond . We don’t know if any of the suspended/postponed provisions of the law will actually take effect . And we certainly don’t know what any of this means for social policy in the long run .But we do know that there won’t be an immediate political unraveling , and that we aren’t headed for the kind of extremely-low-enrollment scenario that seemed conceivable just a few months ago , or the possible world where cancellations had ended up outstripping enrollment , creating a net decline in the number of insured . And knowing that much has significant implications for our politics . It means that the kind of welfare-state embedding described above is taking place on a significant scale , that a large constituency will be served by Obamacare ( through Medicaid as well as the exchanges ) in 2016 and beyond , and that any kind of conservative alternative will have to confront the reality that the kind of tinkering-around-the-edges alternatives to Obamacare that many Republicans have supported to date would end up stripping coverage from millions of newly-insured Americans . That newly-insured constituency may not be as large as the bill’s architects originally hoped , or be composed of the range of buyers that the program ultimately needs . But it will be a fact on the ground to an extent that was by no means certain last December . And that fact will shape , and constrain , the options of the law’s opponents even in the event that Republicans manage to reclaim the White House two years hence .Such political and policy constraints , I should note , are potentially a good thing for would-be conservative reformers , since the serious right-of-center alternatives to Obamacare have always included policies to expand coverage , and with a coverage expansion accomplished , Republicans may find themselves effectively forced in a more serious direction . ( This is a drum that Avik Roy , among others , has been beating for some time . ) Or so I would hope ; of course , they might just end up drifting toward gimmicky micro-reforms instead , or find themselves embroiled a ruinous civil war over how hard to push toward some kind of full repeal .But wherever they go and whatever they do , they will have to deal with the reality that Obamacare , thrice-buried , looks very much alive .
WashingtonIF Mitt Romney’s pivots on President’s Obama’s health care reform act have accelerated to a blur — from repealing on Day 1 , to preserving this or that piece , to punting the decision to the states — it is for an odd reason buried beneath two and a half years of Republican political condemnations : the architecture of the Affordable Care Act is based on conservative , not liberal , ideas about individual responsibility and the power of market forces .This fundamental ideological paradox , drowned out by partisan shouting since before the plan’s passage in 2010 , explains why Obamacare has only lukewarm support from many liberals , who wanted a real , not imagined , “government takeover of health care.” It explains why Republicans have been unable since its passage to come up with anything better . And it explains why the law is nearly identical in design to the legislation Mr. Romney passed in Massachusetts while governor .The core drivers of the health care act are market principles formulated by conservative economists , designed to correct structural flaws in our health insurance system — principles originally embraced by Republicans as a market alternative to the Clinton plan in the early 1990s . The president’s program extends the current health care system — mostly employer-based coverage , administered by commercial health insurers , with care delivered by fee-for-service doctors and hospitals — by removing the biggest obstacles to that system’s functioning like a competitive marketplace .Chief among these obstacles are market limitations imposed by the problematic nature of health insurance , which requires that younger , healthier people subsidize older , sicker ones . Because such participation is often expensive and always voluntary , millions have simply opted out , a risky bet emboldened by the 24/7 presence of the heavily subsidized emergency room down the street . The health care law forcibly repatriates these gamblers , along with those who can not afford to participate in a market that ultimately cross-subsidizes their medical misfortunes anyway , when they get sick and show up in that E.R . And it outlaws discrimination against those who want to participate but can not because of their medical histories . Put aside the considerable legislative detritus of the act , and its aim is clear : to rationalize a dysfunctional health insurance marketplace .This explains why the health insurance industry has been quietly supporting the plan all along . It levels the playing field and expands the potential market by tens of millions of new customers .The rationalization and extension of the current market is financed by the other linchpin of the law : the mandate that we all carry health insurance , an idea forged not by liberal social engineers at the Brookings Institution but by conservative economists at the Heritage Foundation . The individual mandate recognizes that millions of Americans who could buy health insurance choose not to , because it requires trading away today’s wants for tomorrow’s needs . The mandate is about personal responsibility — a hallmark of conservative thought .IN the partisan war sparked by the 2008 election , Republicans conveniently forgot that this was something many of them had supported for years . The only thing wrong with the mandate ? Mr. Obama also thought it was a good idea .The same goes for health insurance exchanges , another idea formulated by conservatives and supported by Republican governors and legislators across the country for years . An exchange is as pro-market a mechanism as they come : free up buyers and sellers , standardize the products , add pricing transparency , and watch what happens . Market Economics 101 .In the shouting match over the health care law , most have somehow missed another of its obvious virtues : it enshrines accountability — yes , another conservative idea . Under today’s system , most health insurers ( and providers ) are accountable to the wrong people , often for the wrong reasons , with the needs of patients coming last . With the transparency , mobility and choice of the exchanges , businesses and individuals can decide for themselves which insurers ( and , embedded in their networks , which providers ) deserve their dollars . They can see , thanks to the often derided benefits standardization of the reform act , what they are actually buying . They can shop around . And businesses are free to decide that they are better off opting out , paying into funds that subsidize individuals’ coverage and letting their employees do their own shopping , with what is , in essence , their own compensation , relocated to the exchanges .Back when the idea of letting businesses and consumers pick their own plans — with their own money on an exchange — first floated around Washington , advocates called them “association health plans.” They , too , would have corrected for the lack of transparency , mobility and choice in local insurance markets by allowing the purchase of health insurance across state lines . They were the cornerstone of what would have been the Bush administration’s reform plan ( had the administration not been distracted by other matters ) . After the rejection of “Hillarycare” in the mid-’90s , association health plans emerged as the centerpiece of pro-market , Republican thinking about health reform — essentially what would become Romneycare , extended via federal law to cover the entire country . So much for Mr. Romney’s argument that his plan in Massachusetts was an expression of states’ rights . His own party had bigger plans for the rest of the country , and they looked a lot like Obamacare .
WE need death panels .Well , maybe not death panels , exactly , but unless we start allocating health care resources more prudently — rationing , by its proper name — the exploding cost of Medicare will swamp the federal budget .But in the pantheon of toxic issues — the famous “third rails” of American politics — none stands taller than overtly acknowledging that elderly Americans are not entitled to every conceivable medical procedure or pharmaceutical .Most notably , President Obama’s estimable Affordable Care Act regrettably includes severe restrictions on any reduction in Medicare services or increase in fees to beneficiaries . In 2009 , Sarah Palin’s rant about death panels even forced elimination from the bill of a provision to offer end-of-life consultations .Now , three years on , the Republican vice-presidential nominee , Paul D. Ryan , has offered his latest ambitious plan for addressing the Medicare problem . But like Mr. Obama’s , it holds limited promise for containing the program’s escalating costs within sensible boundaries .The Obama and Ryan plans are not without common ground ; both propose an identical formula for capping the growth in Medicare spending per beneficiary . And both dip into the same toolbox ( particularly lower payments to providers ) to achieve a reduction of nearly $ 1 trillion in Medicare expenditures over the next decade from projected levels .That’s where the agreement ends . Mr. Ryan believes that meeting the goal over the long term requires introducing more competition into Medicare through vouchers to purchase private insurance .But Ryan’s approach was rendered toothless when the issue’s brutal politics forced him to retreat from his initial tough plan to simply cap the growth in government spending on Medicare and stick the inevitable overage onto beneficiaries . Under his revised plan , private insurers would be required to offer the same level of benefits as traditional Medicare , meaning that any savings would have to come from unidentified efficiencies ( the ever-popular “waste , fraud and abuse” ) .If the cap was breached — as it almost certainly would eventually be — Mr. Ryan blithely says , “Congress would be required to intervene.” Fat chance ; Congress regularly does the opposite when it rolls back caps on payments to doctors and hospitals .Meanwhile , Mr. Obama’s hopes for sustained cost containment are pinned on a to-be-determined mix of squeezing reimbursements , embracing a selection of the creative ideas that have spewed forth from health care policy wonks and scouring the globe for innovations .To Mr. Obama’s credit , his plan has more teeth than Mr. Ryan’s ; if his Independent Payment Advisory Board comes up with savings , Congress must accept either them or vote for an equivalent package . The problem is , the advisory board can’t propose reducing benefits ( a k a rationing ) or raising fees ( another form of rationing ) , without which the spending target looms impossibly large .That’s the view of the bipartisan Medicare trustees , whose 2012 report stated : “Actual future Medicare expenditures are likely to exceed the intermediate projections shown in this report , possibly by quite large amounts.”To be sure , health care cost increases have moderated , in part because of the recession and in part because Medicare has been tightening its reimbursements . But those thumbscrews can’t be tightened forever ; Medicare reimbursement rates are already well below those of private providers .Let’s not forget that with the elderly population growing rapidly , even if cost increases for each beneficiary can be contained , Medicare would still claim a rising share of the American economy .Medicare needs to take a cue from Willie Sutton , who reportedly said he robbed banks because that’s where the money was . The big money in Medicare is not to be found in Mr. Ryan’s competition or Mr. Obama’s innovation , but in reducing the cost of treating people in the last year of life , which consumes more than a quarter of the program’s budget .No one wants to lose an aging parent . And with price out of the equation , it’s natural for patients and their families to try every treatment , regardless of expense or efficacy . But that imposes an enormous societal cost that few other nations have been willing to bear . Many countries whose health care systems are regularly extolled — including Canada , Australia and New Zealand — have systems for rationing care .Take Britain , which provides universal coverage with spending at proportionately almost half of American levels . Its National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence uses a complex quality-adjusted life year system to put an explicit value ( up to about $ 48,000 per year ) on a treatment’s ability to extend life .At the least , the Independent Payment Advisory Board should be allowed to offer changes in services and costs . We may shrink from such stomach-wrenching choices , but they are inescapable .
Although few Americans say the Affordable Care Act has helped them , the uninsured rate has declined significantly since the law took effect , and appears to be leveling off at around 13.4 percent .Via GallupThe uninsured rate so far in the second quarter of 2014 is 13.4 % , with the rate in April and May as individual months also averaging 13.4 % , respectively .…The percentage of U.S. adults lacking insurance coverage in the first two months of the second quarter of 2014 is down from 17.1 % in the fourth quarter of 2013 and from the 15.6 % average in the first quarter of 2014 . The current 13.4 % average for the second quarter of 2014 is the lowest level recorded since Gallup began tracking this measure in 2008 .
The Congressional Budget Office said yesterday that the Affordable Care Act should be cheaper than originally projected .Via The New RepublicIn February , the last time CBO addressed these issues comprehensively , it predicted that the net cost of the law’s coverage provisions would be about $ 1.4 trillion over ten years . Now , CBO says , it’s likely to be about $ 1.3 trillion , or $ 100 billion less .It’s actually the latest in a series of revisions , each one suggesting the law would cost less money than the previous projection had suggested . And why this latest change ? It doesn’t appear to be because the law will reach fewer people . CBO now expects slightly more people to end up with health insurance , at least over the long run . The CBO’s primary explanation for lower costs is that health insurance premiums on the new exchanges — what the administration calls “marketplaces”— are lower than CBO had originally expected they would be .
The Obama administration said yesterday that it would treat the March 31 deadline for enrolling in a health plan somewhat flexibly . Consumers who begin to apply by March 31 will have until mid-April to finish .Relatedly , according to the Kaiser Health Tracking Poll for March , “substantial shares” of the uninsured population don’t realize that the deadline to sign up for health insurance is fast approaching .“As the clock ticks down on open enrollment for new coverage options under the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) , the latest Kaiser Health Tracking Poll finds that six in ten of the uninsured are unaware of the March 31 deadline to sign up for coverage . When reminded of the deadline and the fine for not getting covered , half of those who lack coverage as of mid-March say they plan to remain uninsured . Meanwhile , four in ten of the uninsured are still unaware of the law’s subsidies to help lower-income Americans purchase coverage , and half don’t know about the law’s expansion of Medicaid.”
The current state of public opinion on health reform is really peculiar . If you’ve been following the issue at all closely , you know that the Affordable Care Act is one of the great comeback stories of public policy : after a terrible start , it has dramatically exceeded expectations . But hardly anyone seems to know that .It’s easy to understand how that happens for Fox-watchers and Rush-listeners , who are fed a steady diet of supposed Obamacare disaster stories . Remember this ?But the real story hasn’t even gotten through to many people who should know better .Over the weekend I had dinner in NYC with some very smart , sophisticated people ; yes , all of them liberals . And almost everyone in the group was under the impression that Obamacare is still going badly — they wanted me to tell them whether it could still be turned around .Meanwhile , New York ( which created its own exchange ) is a huge success story : enrollment is 60 percent higher than federal projections , premiums have been cut in half .An aside : New York was already a community-rating state , where insurers weren’t allowed to discriminate based on medical history . But the result of that system was that healthy people tended to stay out of the individual market , creating a bad risk pool that drove up rates . Now everyone has to be in , dramatically improving the risk pool . As such , the New York experiences demonstrates the essential role of the individual mandate for reform .But anyway , back to the mystery : here we have smart , pro-reform people living in a state where reform is going really well . And they don’t know it !In part this may reflect the Obama administration’s lackluster job so far in getting the word out . But it also , I think , reflects a persistent anti-ACA tilt in news coverage . In the final days of March I wrote about the de facto blackout on the obvious surge in enrollments ; if you weren’t reading Charles Gaba and/or bloggers who followed him , you were in the dark about a huge developing story . And this tilt has continued .Just FYI : the article I linked above , about the spectacular success of New York reform , was on page A16 …
LOS ANGELES â THE Anthem Blue Cross representative who answered my call told me that there was a silver lining in the cancellation of my individual P.P.O . policy and the $ 5,400 annual increase that I would have to pay for the Affordable Care Act-compliant option : now if I have Stage 4 cancer or need a sex-change operation , Iâd be covered regardless of pre-existing conditions . Never mind that the new provider network would eliminate coverage for my and my sonâs long-term doctors and hospitals .The Anthem rep cheerily explained that despite the companyâs â I paraphrase â draconian rates and limited network , my benefits , which also include maternity coverage ( handy for a 46-year-old ) , would âbe actually much richer.âI , of course , would be actually much poorer . And it was this aspect of the bum deal that , to my surprise , turned out to be a very unpopular thing to gripe about .âObamacare or Kafkacare ? â I posted on Facebook as soon as I hung up with Anthem . I vented about the call and wrote that the president should be protecting the middle class , not making our lives substantially harder . For extra sympathy , I may have thrown in the fact that Iâm a single mom . ( O.K. , I did . )Then I sat back and waited for the love to pour in . Or at least the âlike.â Lots of likes . After all , I have 1,037 Facebook friends . Surely , theyâd commiserate .Except that they didnât .Instead , aside from my friend David , who attempted to cheer me up with , âMy dad , who never turns down a bargain , would take the sex change just because itâs free , â my respondents implied â in posts that , to my annoyance , kept getting more âlikesâ â that it was beyond uncool to be whining about myself when the less fortunate would finally have insurance .âThe nation has been better off , â wrote one friend . âOver 33 million people who did not have insurance are now going to get it.â Thatâs all fine and good for âthe nation , â but what about my $ 5,400 rate hike ( after-tax dollars , I wanted to add , but dared not in this group of previously closeted Mother Teresas ) ? Another friend wrote , âYes , Iâm paying an extra 200 a month , but Iâm okay with doing that so that others who need it can have health care.âI was shocked . Who knew my friends were such humanitarians ? Has Obamacare made it un-P.C . to be concerned by a serious burden on my familyâs well-being ?The heated reactions even moved offline . Frustrated , I observed to one friend who was covered through her work that when an issue didnât affect people directly , they became âtheoretically generous.â Ask them to donate several thousand dollars so that the less fortunate can have medical insurance â which is exactly what President Obama is asking me to do â and Iâll bet theyâd change their tune about âending inequalityâ and âcreating fairnessâ and âdoing whatâs good for the country.âRefreshingly , the two people who showed real empathy were my insurance broker and my friend Nicole , who sent daily links to news stories about people who were also stripped of their coverage and mandated to buy expensive exchange or private policies without access to their current doctors , yet just missed the cutoff for subsidies .There was one story about people suing Anthem for not being grandfathered in after changing their policies post-2010 . In fact , it was in 2011 that I altered mine , dumping maternity benefits so that I didnât have to pay for everyone elseâs pregnancies . Little did I know Iâd end up losing my insurance and paying for everyone elseâs pregnancies .There was even an article about a cancer patient who had lost access to her doctors . To her credit , Nicole refrained from saying , âBut , Lori , this woman has cancer and you are so much more fortunate ! âLike Bridget Jonesâs âsmug marrieds , â the âsmug insuredsâ â friends who were covered through their own or spousesâ employers or who were grandfathered into their plans â asked why I didnât âjustâ switch all of our long-term doctors , suck it up and pay an extra $ 200 a month for a restrictive network on the exchange , or marry the guy Iâm dating . How romantic : âI didnât marry you just to save money , honey . I married you for your provider network.âAlong with the smug insureds , President Obama doesnât care much about the relatively small percentage of us with canceled coverage and no viable replacement . He keeps apologizing while maintaining that itâs for the good of the country , a vast improvement âover all.âAnd the âover allâ might agree . But the self-employed middle class is being sacrificed at the altar of politically correct rhetoric , with nobody helping to ensure our health , fiscal or otherwise , because itâs trendy to cheer for the underdog . Embracing the noble cause is all very well â as long as yours isnât the âfortunateâ family that loses its access to comprehensive , affordable health care while the rest of the nation gets it .The truly noble act here is being performed by my friend Nicole , who keeps posting Obamacare fiasco stories on my Facebook page , despite being conspicuously ignored , except for my single âlike.â Itâs the lone âlikeâ that falls in the forest , the click nobody wants to hear .
FRANKFORT , Ky. â SUNDAY morning news programs identify Kentucky as the red state with two high-profile Republican senators who claim their rhetoric represents an electorate that gave President Obama only about a third of its presidential vote in 2012 .So why then is Kentucky â more quickly than almost any other state â moving to implement the Affordable Care Act ?Because thereâs a huge disconnect between the rank partisanship of national politics and the outlook of governors whose job it is to help beleaguered families , strengthen work forces , attract companies and create a balanced budget .Itâs no coincidence that numerous governors â not just Democrats like me but also Republicans like Jan Brewer of Arizona , John Kasich of Ohio and Rick Snyder of Michigan â see the Affordable Care Act not as a referendum on President Obama but as a tool for historic change .That is especially true in Kentucky , a state where residentsâ collective health has long been horrendous . The state ranks among the worst , if not the worst , in almost every major health category , including smoking , cancer deaths , preventable hospitalizations , premature death , heart disease and diabetes .Weâre making progress , but incremental improvements are not enough . We need big solutions with the potential for transformational change .The Affordable Care Act is one of those solutions .For the first time , we will make affordable health insurance available to every single citizen in the state . Right now , 640,000 people in Kentucky are uninsured . Thatâs almost one in six Kentuckians .Lack of health coverage puts their health and financial security at risk .They roll the dice and pray they donât get sick . They choose between food and medicine . They ignore checkups that would catch serious conditions early . They put off doctorâs appointments , hoping a condition turns out to be nothing . And they live knowing that bankruptcy is just one bad diagnosis away .Furthermore , their children go long periods without checkups that focus on immunizations , preventive care and vision and hearing tests . If they have diabetes , asthma or infected gums , their conditions remain untreated and unchecked .For Kentucky as a whole , the negative impact is similar but larger â jacked-up costs , decreased worker productivity , lower quality of life , depressed school attendance and a poor image .The Affordable Care Act will address these weaknesses .Some 308,000 of Kentuckyâs uninsured â mostly the working poor â will be covered when we increase Medicaid eligibility guidelines to 138 percent of the federal poverty level .PricewaterhouseCoopers and the Urban Studies Institute at the University of Louisville concluded that expanding Medicaid would inject $ 15.6 billion into Kentuckyâs economy over the next eight years , create almost 17,000 new jobs , have an $ 802.4 million positive budget impact ( by transferring certain expenditures from the state to the federal government , among other things ) , protect hospitals from cuts in indigent care funding and shield businesses from up to $ 48 million in annual penalties .In short , we couldnât afford not to do it .The other 332,000 uninsured Kentuckians will be able to access affordable coverage â most with a discount â through the Health Benefit Exchange , the online insurance marketplace we named Kynect : Kentuckyâs Healthcare Connection .Kentucky is the only Southern state both expanding Medicaid and operating a state-based exchange , and we remain on target to meet the Oct. 1 deadline to open Kynect with the support of a call center that is providing some 100 jobs . Having been the first state-based exchange to complete the readiness review with the United States Department of Health and Human Services , we hope to become the first one to be certified .Frankly , we canât implement the Affordable Care Act fast enough .As for naysayers , Iâm offended by their partisan gamesmanship , as they continue to pour time , money and energy into overturning or defunding the Affordable Care Act . Itâs shameful that these critics havenât invested that same level of energy into trying to improve the health of our citizens .They insist that the Affordable Care Act will never work â when in fact a similar approach put into effect in Massachusetts by Mitt Romney , then the governor , is working .So , to those more worried about political power than Kentuckyâs families , I say , âGet over it.âThe Affordable Care Act was approved by Congress and sanctioned by the Supreme Court . It is the law of the land .Get over it ... and get out of the way so I can help my people . Here in Kentucky , we can not afford to waste another day or another life .
Conservatives appear to be really upset that liberals are actually taking on the facts in the anti-Obamacare ads they’ve been running . How dare you question whether the people in these ads are giving an accurate picture — they’re suffering !OK , we’ve seen this kind of play before . Remember how anyone suggesting that Dick Cheney and whatshisname misled us into invading Iraq was attacking American’s brave fighting men and women ?But there’s a different kind of struggle anyone trying to point out the facts encounters — a barrage of anecdotes . You say that the Obamacare horror stories are fake , but I kind of know this man who is being told that he has to buy a policy he can’t possibly afford / I read this sad story in the Wall Street Journal / I heard this tale on the radio / etc..How do you answer that ?Well , it can’t be done retail . If the Koch brothers are pouring money into ads featuring a person , or the GOP response to the SOTU tells a story , then it’s worth trying to track down the particulars of this case . But to deal with the broader problem of anecdotes , what you need is a framework that tells you which anecdotes are almost surely wrong .So here’s what you need to understand . The Affordable Care Act isn’t magic — it produces losers as well as winners . But it’s not black magic either , turning everyone into a loser . What the Act does is in effect to increase the burden on fortunate people — the healthy and wealthy — to lift some burdens on the less fortunate : people with chronic illnesses or other preexisting conditions , low-income workers .Suppose , then , that someone comes to you with an anecdote about a cancer patient , or just an older person in poor health , and tells you that this person is about to lose the care she needs , or face a huge increase in expenses , under Obamacare . Well , it’s almost certainly not true — people like that are overwhelmingly beneficiaries of health reform , thanks to community rating , which means that they can’t be discriminated against because of their condition .Or suppose that someone tells you about a struggling worker who had adequate coverage but is now being confronted with unaffordable premiums . You should immediately ask , what about the subsidies ? Because the Affordable Care Act has subsidies that are there specifically to keep premiums affordable for lower earners .If someone insists that he knows about someone in these categories who really is being grievously hurt , well , the burden of proof rests with the claimant . Basically , stories like that are going to be very rare .Obamacare opponents could , of course , go with the real losers — people in the one percent paying higher taxes , healthy young men who are getting by with cheap , minimalist policies . But they want sob stories — the sick middle-aged woman facing tragedy . And so far , every single one of those sob stories has turned out to be false — because the very nature of the reform is such that such things hardly ever happen .
Until just the other day , Obamacare was a total disaster ; no way would it meet its first-year enrollment targets , or come anywhere close .Now the opponents have retreated to their next line of defense : OK , people are signing up , but only because their existing policies were cancelled , so the program isn’t actually reducing the number of uninsured .Oops:Furthermore:These early estimates understate the full effects of the Affordable Care Act on the uninsured for two major reasons . First , the survey does not capture the enrollment surge that occurred at the end of the open enrollment period , because 80 percent of the responses to the March 2014 HRMS were provided by March 6 , 2014 . Second , these estimates do not reflect the effects of some important ACA provisions ( such as the ability to keep dependents on health plans until age 26 and early state Medicaid expansions ) that were implemented before 2013 .Remember , this is just the first year . It has been assumed all along that it would take several years for the word to spread , and the law to have its full effect .
You might think that the methodical extermination of millions of Jews by a brutal regime intent on world domination would resist appropriation as an all-purpose metaphor . You might think that genocide , of all things , would be safe from conversion into sloppy simile .Youâd be wrong .After Paul Ryanâs fact-challenged address at the Republican National Convention last year , the chairman of the Democratic Party in California actually compared him and his compatriots to the Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels . A short time later , the chairman of the Democratic Party in South Carolina likened that stateâs Republican governor , Nikki Haley , to Adolf Hitlerâs mistress , Eva Braun .At that point Abraham Foxman , the national director of the Anti-Defamation League , did what he shouldnât need to do even once , let alone the multiple times that heâs been forced to . He implored politicians and pundits to stop it already .No matter . Allusions to Nazi Germany were back for debates over gun control and , of course , Obamacare . Ted Cruz , the Senateâs prince of tirades , compared people who claim that the new insurance program canât be stopped to those who rolled over for Hitler and the Third Reich . This prompted a public reprimand from John McCain , who has developed something of a sideline career of swatting Cruz on the nose . Theyâre like a hapless master and his hopeless dachshund . The former keeps trying to housebreak the latter , while the latter just beams at every mess he makes .Itâs not only Nazis who are flourishing in this era of metaphors gone mad , of analogy bloat . Lynch mobs are also having a good go of it . A senator who was quoted anonymously in The Times last week used that term to describe the Republican lawmakers who had lit into Cruz during a private luncheon , and lynching was invoked more disturbingly by the chief executive officer of A.I.G. , who recently said that public complaints about Wall Street bankersâ bonuses were intended âto get everybody out there with their pitchforks and their hangman nooses.â This , he added , was âsort of like what we did in the Deep South.âHow absolutely bonkers . And yet how unsurprising . Weâre awash these days in metaphors as overworked as our political debate is overwrought , and itâs impossible not to wonder how much one contributes to the other . When nuance and perspective exit the language , do they exit the conversation as well ? When you speak in ludicrous extremes , do you think that way , too ?Obamacare has proved to be not just ideologically divisive but linguistically fertile . Thereâs seemingly no event or passage in American history to which it canât be compared .The terrorist attacks of 9/11 ? Check . Back when Mike Pence , Indianaâs Republican governor , was still in Congress , he summoned that dayâs horror to characterize the Supreme Court ruling that upheld the Affordable Care Act .Slavery ? Check . Ken Cuccinelli , the Republican candidate for governor of Virginia , has described opposition to Obamacare in terms of stands against fugitive slave laws .The hyperbole and hysteria make any constructive debate impossible , and they insult the past , robbing important events of the specific meaning and individual detail they deserve . Consider our recurring â-gateâ mania . We equate each new scandal , whether extra-large or fun-size , with Watergate , and by willfully misremembering President Richard Nixonâs crimes , we dilute them . Itâs just a suffix for the taking , a point of comparison for such wildly unrelated matters as the spilled secrets of Arkansas law enforcement officers who were supposedly privy to Bill Clintonâs private life . Troopergate , that was called .For President Obama , Benghazi was supposed to be his Watergate , and so was the I.R.S.âs scrutiny of conservative groups , and so were a bunch of other things I canât even remember anymore . They blur and fade , which is not to say they didnât matter . Itâs to say that when everything is supposedly like everything else , nothingâs distinctive . Itâs all one big mush .For that reason , among others , we should watch our words . They have consequences . As irresponsible and detestable as the recent actions of the most conservative wing of House Republicans have been , weâd be better off without figurative talk of hostage taking and guns to heads , without headlines like one in The Huffington Post that said : âBoehner Threatens to Shoot the Hostage.â That sort of language only turns up the heat .And I cringe at how pointlessly hurtful it must have been for a 9/11 widow or widower to listen to the right-wing moralist Gary Bauer exhort voters to fight back against President Obamaâs agenda the way passengers on United Flight 93 fought back against hijackers . Or for Holocaust survivors to hear all this gratuitous Nazi talk .You know whatâs just like Germany in the 1930s ? Germany in the 1930s . Weâre in an unfortunate place , but we neednât travel back there to describe it .
Like confused poll respondents , Scott Brown , the former Massachusetts Senator who’s running for Senate in New Hampshire , says he thinks the Affordable Care Act is disastrous , but seems to like everything it does .Via VoxIn an interview with WBUR , he called Obamacare a “disaster.” Then he was asked what he’s for — and he went on to describe Obamacare . “I’ve always felt that people should either get some type of health care options , or pay for it with a nice competitive fee , ” he said . “That’s all great . I believe it in my heart . In terms of preexisting conditions , catastrophic coverages , covering kids , whatever we want to do.” He even said it could “include the Medicaid expansion [ for ] folks who need that care and coverage.”Oh , he also promises his plan won’t raise taxes , cut spending on Medicare , or make people drive very far to go to the hospital . So his plan will have more generous insurance options and no way to pay for them . In other words , his plan will be like Obamacare , but even better ! Call it Fauxbamacare .
Ezra Klein , in his new capacity as one of the impresarios behind Vox , has written a pair of attention-grabbing posts — here , and then here — defending the proposition that Obamacare has , in some sense , “won , ” and that conservatives who can’t come to terms with that victory can’t come to terms with reality itself . Reading them , it struck me that this argument would benefit from laying down some specific markers for the near future , because Klein seems to move back and forth between two definitions of success . At times , as when he writes that Obamacare “has won its survival” and allows that that “there are still many good critiques to make” of the law , he seems to be using a narrow definition , with which I mostly agree — the law won’t collapse under its own weight , the enrollment levels are high enough to make a return to the coverage status quo ante unlikely , etc . But when he uses language like “the individual mandate … is working” and “the law is back on its expected track , ” and concludes that “ [ Kathleen Sebelius ] can leave with the law she helped build looking , shockingly , like a success , ” it implies a stronger definition of victory , in which Obamacare isn’t just continuing , isn’t just unlikely to be swiftly repealed , but is clearly succeeding as a policy in basically the way its advocates predicted that it would .So I think it would be useful for the law’s supporters to specify the metrics/numbers/outcomes that would vindicate the latter claim . Here are three fronts where specificity would be helpful:Enrollment . In the summer of 2012 , after the Supreme Court decision freeing up states to reject the Medicaid expansion , the C.B.O . projected that 14 million Americans would get coverage under Obamacare in the first year , and 33 million by 2022 . This February , after the botched rollout , the projections were 13 million in 2014 , 27 million in the long run . The latest estimate , out this month , drops the 2014 projection down to 12 million , and the long-term number to 26 million . Meanwhile , the question of how many previously-uninsured people have gained insurance as of right now is , as this Vox explainer suggests , quite difficult to answer ( and sadly , it may be about to become even more difficult ) , but a guesstimate of 9-10 million seems pretty plausible — and short , N.B. , of even the C.B.O.’s more modest projection for this year .So … how low can the numbers go before they start to make the law look like something less than a success ? I assume that liberals will declare victory , with some reason , if Obamacare meets the C.B.O.’s current ( reduced ) expectations , this year and beyond . But what if it doesn’t ? Suppose that by the end of 2016 , when the C.B.O . expects the total number of uninsured to have fallen by 25 million , it’s only fallen by , say , 15 million instead — and most of the previously uninsured are getting coverage through Medicare , while the exchanges are mostly populated by people whose prior individual-market coverage was cancelled , either in 2014 or once grandfathering runs out . Will that be a success story ? Presumably there’s some kind of shortfall that the law’s supporters would consider , if not a sign of outright failure , than at least a reason to be fairly disappointed with how Obamacare has worked . It would be helpful to know what they think that long-run number lies .The cost curve . Before we entered into the agony of the botched roll-out , the law’s supporters were eagerly citing the persistently low rate of health care inflation as a sign that Obamacare was already working as designed , already having a beneficial effect . But as Vox’s Sarah Kliff reported yesterday , the latest inflation numbers cast some doubt on that hopeful hypothesis , with federal data indicating “that health care spending is now growing just as quickly as it was prior to the recession.”Now this may be temporary : Some kind of cost inflation was always likely to be associated with this year’s roll-out of subsidies and Medicaid spending , and the law’s supporters can reasonably argue that we should wait a few years , until the coverage expansion ( however large ) has become a normal feature of the system , to judge Obamacare’s impact on inflation overall .But at a certain point that judgment will need to be made . So , again , what should be the standard ? What should be the baseline ? Does Obamacare need to hold inflation to the low 2011-2012 pace ( a pace , again , that many liberals wanted to credit to its early impact ) in order to be counted as a cost-containing success ? Does it just need to hold inflation below , say , a 10 or 20-year average ? ( Note that both on its own terms and relative to overall inflation , health cost inflation had been declining for seven years before Obamacare was passed — so just holding either rate below the average of 2000-2010 would not actually be that impressive . ) In other words — what does the Affordable Care Act have to achieve in order to live up to its name ?Health outcomes . It’s been crowded out by the website drama like everything else , but one of the major divides between Obamacare supporters and skeptics was over whether , and to what extent , the law would literally be a lifesaver — with writers like Klein famously invoking “lives saved” figures in the hundreds of thousands during the run-up to the law’s passage , while doubters cited the surprisingly-weak link between insurance status and health outcomes , and raised the potential public-health downsides , in terms of innovations lost or never sought , of increasing government control .Now public health data can be even fuzzier and more debatable than cost inflation and enrollment numbers . But even with lower-than-hoped-for enrollment figures overall , we should still be able to see some of the happy consequences , at some point , if Klein et . al . are right : Looking back from 2020 or 2025 , certainly , there should be some kind of disjuncture between U.S. health outcomes pre- and post-Obamacare ( maybe a reversal of this trend , at the very least ? ) , and some kind of outcomes gap should open between states that implemented the law fully and states that refused the extra Medicaid dollars .So here , too , I’m curious what liberals expect to see , what they’ll count as vindication , what would disappoint them , and what kind of results they think will be sufficient to prove that Obamacare is , in fact , a lifesaving success .And then for my own part , I’ll lay down this marker for the future : If , in 2023 , the uninsured rate is where the C.B.O . currently projects or lower , health inflation’s five-year average is running below the post-World War II norm , and the trend in the age-adjusted mortality rate shows a positive alteration starting right about now , I will write a post ( or send out a Singularity-wide transmission , maybe ) entitled “I Was Wrong About Obamacare” — or , if he prefers , just “Ezra Klein Was Right.”
TODAY marks the beginning of health care coverage under the Affordable Care Act’s new insurance exchanges , for which two million Americans have signed up . Now that the individual mandate is officially here , let me begin with an admission : Obamacare is awful .That is the dirty little secret many liberals have avoided saying out loud for fear of aiding the president’s enemies , at a time when the ideal of universal health care needed all the support it could get . Unfortunately , this meant that instead of blaming companies like Novartis , which charges leukemia patients $ 90,000 annually for the drug Gleevec , or health insurance chief executives like Stephen Hemsley of UnitedHealth Group , who made nearly $ 102 million in 2009 , for the sky-high price of American health care , the president’s Democratic supporters bought into the myth that it was all those people going to get free colonoscopies and chemotherapy for the fun of it .I believe Obamacare’s rocky start — clueless planning , a lousy website , insurance companies raising rates , and the president’s telling people they could keep their coverage when , in fact , not all could — is a result of one fatal flaw : The Affordable Care Act is a pro-insurance-industry plan implemented by a president who knew in his heart that a single-payer , Medicare-for-all model was the true way to go . When right-wing critics “expose” the fact that President Obama endorsed a single-payer system before 2004 , they’re actually telling the truth .What we now call Obamacare was conceived at the Heritage Foundation , a conservative think tank , and birthed in Massachusetts by Mitt Romney , then the governor . The president took Romneycare , a program designed to keep the private insurance industry intact , and just improved some of its provisions . In effect , the president was simply trying to put lipstick on the dog in the carrier on top of Mitt Romney’s car . And we knew it .By 2017 , we will be funneling over $ 100 billion annually to private insurance companies . You can be sure they’ll use some of that to try to privatize Medicare .For many people , the “affordable” part of the Affordable Care Act risks being a cruel joke . The cheapest plan available to a 60-year-old couple making $ 65,000 a year in Hartford , Conn. , will cost $ 11,800 in annual premiums . And their deductible will be $ 12,600 . If both become seriously ill , they might have to pay almost $ 25,000 in a single year . ( Pre-Obamacare , they could have bought insurance that was cheaper but much worse , potentially with unlimited out-of-pocket costs . )And yet — I would be remiss if I didn’t say this — Obamacare is a godsend . My friend Donna Smith , who was forced to move into her daughter’s spare room at age 52 because health problems bankrupted her and her husband , Larry , now has cancer again . As she undergoes treatment , at least she won’t be in terror of losing coverage and becoming uninsurable . Under Obamacare , her premium has been cut in half , to $ 456 per month .Let’s not take a victory lap yet , but build on what there is to get what we deserve : universal quality health care .Those who live in red states need the benefit of Medicaid expansion . It may have seemed like smart politics in the short term for Republican governors to grab the opportunity offered by the Supreme Court rulings that made Medicaid expansion optional for states , but it was long-term stupid : If those 20 states hold out , they will eventually lose an estimated total of $ 20 billion in federal funds per year — money that would be going to hospitals and treatment .In blue states , let’s lobby for a public option on the insurance exchange — a health plan run by the state government , rather than a private insurer . In Massachusetts , State Senator James B. Eldridge is trying to pass a law that would set one up . Some counties in California are also trying it . Montana came up with another creative solution . Gov . Brian Schweitzer , a Democrat who just completed two terms , set up several health clinics to treat state workers , with no co-pays and no deductibles . The doctors there are salaried employees of the state of Montana ; their only goal is their patients’ health . ( If this sounds too much like big government to you , you might like to know that Google , Cisco and Pepsi do exactly the same . )All eyes are on Vermont’s plan for a single-payer system , starting in 2017 . If it flies , it will change everything , with many states sure to follow suit by setting up their own versions . That’s why corporate money will soon flood into Vermont to crush it . The legislators who’ll go to the mat for this will need all the support they can get : If you live east of the Mississippi , look up the bus schedule to Montpelier .So let’s get started . Obamacare can’t be fixed by its namesake . It’s up to us to make it happen .
A panel of the D.C. federal appellate court ruled today that the federal government does not have the authority to administer insurance subsidies in states that refused to set up their own exchanges . If the ruling stands—a big if—it could deprive millions of enrollees of the support they need to purchase health insurance .Via The Incidental EconomistHow much will this decision cost the working poor ? The amount varies with income and other variables , but for a 40 year old individual making $ 30,000 a year , the tax credit was estimated at $ 1345 ( KFF estimate here ) . Retroactive tax bills under Halbig will be significant and everyone impacted will have trouble paying for health insurance going forward ( about 57 % of exchange participants were previously uninsured , according to a KFF survey ) . How many people will be hurt ?At first glance : anyone receiving tax credits in the 27 states with federally facilitated exchanges ( FFEs ) : ( AL , AK , AZ , FL , GA , IN , KS , LA , ME , MS , MO , MT , NE , NJ , NC , ND , OH , OK , PN , SC , SD , TN , TX , UT , VA , WI and WY ; KFF list here ) . But the government reports 36 states as having FFEs , including 9 additional states not included on the list above ( ID , NM , AR , DE , IL , IA , MI , NH , and WV ; more on this below ) . Using this broader definition , 4.683 million Americans may now have a surprising tax bill and be at risk of losing health insurance , being told retroactively that they didn’t qualify for tax credits after all .
The Times has a very nice survey of the results to date of the Affordable Care Act , aka Obamacare , aka death panels and the moral equivalent of slavery .The verdict : It’s going well . A big expansion in coverage , which is affordable for a large majority ; the main exceptions seem to be people who went for the minimum coverage allowed , keeping premiums down but leaving large co-payments . None of the predictions of disaster has come even slightly true .
Yesterday , Ohio governor John Kasich briefly made news when the Associated Press quoted him saying that repeal of Obamacare was simply “not gon na happen , ” and adding that “the opposition to it was really either political or ideological , ” and in either case insufficiently attuned to the “real improvements in people’s lives.” Liberals pounced , conservatives groaned , and Kasich quickly went into damage control mode , explaining that he was only talking about the Medicaid expansion , which he had already explicitly supported and implemented , and not the rest of the law , which he still officially wants to ( say it with me ) repealandreplace .That last is the official position , of course , of the entire Republican Party , which currently enjoys , per my colleagues at The Upshot , a 66 percent chance of seizing a Senate majority in two weeks time . But the controversy around Kasich’s comments are a useful reminder that not only is there no Republican consensus on how to actually replace the health care law , but almost no G.O.P . Senate candidates are actually campaigning on a politically credible replacement plan — with “politically credible” defined , for reasons I’ve elaborated on before , as “not rolling coverage levels back toward the pre-Obamacare status quo.”The one major exception is Ed Gillespie , running against Mark Warner in Virginia , whose plan Ramesh Ponnuru has commented on and defended here and here . ( Since Gillespie’s background is in what I’ve called the “donorist” wing of the party , which does not always distinguish itself in pushing middle-class-friendly economic policy , he deserves particular credit for taking the policy leap . ) But Gillespie is also , per current polling , unlikely to join a Republican Senate majority next year , whereas many G.O.P . candidates — the potential Majority Leader included — who have hemmed and hawed or talked in anti-Obamacare boilerplate and vague generalities when asked about health care policy are more likely to pull their races out . Which will be seen by some , no doubt , as vindicating the risk-averse , somewhat cynical approach to health policy that Republicans have taken throughout the health care debate …… except , of course , that in this cycle that debate is happening against the backdrop of a political map that heavily favors the G.O.P. , whereas in 2016 ( as in 2012 ) the map will be different , tougher , and the health care law ( while no doubt still unpopular overall ) will be more locked-in , more a part of people’s ordinary experience , and the promise of full repeal will look even sketchier than it does now . At which point a Republican Party that wants to be competitive nationally will start to feel a lot of pressure ( probably not quite enough to counteract the influence of the primary electorate , but we’ll see ) to drift toward something like Kasich’s ( quite popular , in a purple state ) position , which basically amounts to “if you like the single-payer part of Obamacare , you can keep the single-payer part of Obamacare , and let’s talk about the other stuff later.”For conservatives who don’t want their party to gradually , eventually , inevitably end up taking roughly that position in national elections , then , there’s a pretty narrow window to rally around something like the Gillespie approach instead . That window was open in this campaign ; I think it will be open again in 2016 . After that , though , the political risks ( already real enough ) associated with backing a legitimate Obamacare alternative will rise apace , the downsides of calling for outright repeal will likewise increase , and Republicans running for office outside red states will probably just end up endorsing the views that Ohio’s popular governor is dancing around right now .Of course events might intervene , but for now anti-Obamacare but reform-minded conservatives should be rooting for Gillespie to pull off a miracle comeback … because a party that can not imitate his Obamacre position today will almost certainly accept John Kasich’s position tomorrow .
A peculiar aspect of the Obama years has been the disconnect between the rage of Obama’s enemies and the yawns of his sort-of allies . The right denounces financial reform as a vast government takeover — and lobbies fiercely against it — while the left dismisses reform as symbols without substance . The right accuses Obama of being a socialist stealing the money of hard-working billionaires , while the left dismisses him as having done nothing to address inequality .On all these issues , the truth is that Obama has done far more than he gets credit for — not everything you’d want , to be sure , or even most of what should be done , but enough so that the right has reason to be furious .The latest case in point : taxes on the one percent . I keep hearing that Obama has done nothing to make the one percent pay more ; the Congressional Budget Office does not agree:According to CBO , the effective tax rate on the one percent — reflecting the end of the Bush tax cuts at the top end , plus additional taxes associated with Obamacare — is now back to pre-Reagan levels . You could argue that we should have raised taxes at the top much more , to lean against the widening of market inequality , and I would agree . But it’s still a much bigger change than I think anyone on the left seems to realize .
Or , actually , demonstrates by example what’s wrong with Washington .Matt Yglesias finds Ron Fournier saying this about health reform:On health care , we needed a market-driven plan that decreases the percentage of uninsured Americans without convoluting the U.S. health care system . Just such a plan sprang out of conservative think tanks and was tested by a GOP governor in Massachusetts , Mitt Romney .Instead of a bipartisan agreement to bring that plan to scale , we got more partisan warfare . The GOP resisted , Obama surrendered his mantle of bipartisanship , and Democrats muscled through a one-sided law that has never been popular with a majority of the public .The mind reels . How is it possible for anyone who has been following politics and , presumably , policy for the past six years not to know that Obamacare is , in all important respects , identical to Romneycare ? It has the same three key provisions — nondiscrimination by insurers , a mandate for individuals , and subsidies to make the mandate workable . It was developed by the same people . I and many others have frequently referred to ObamaRomneycare .Well , I’ve know for years that many political pundits don’t think that understanding policy is part of their job . But this is still extreme . And I’m sorry to go after an individual here — but for God’s sake , don’t you have to know something about the actual content of a policy you critique ?And what’s actually going on here is worse than ignorance . It’s pretty clear that we’re watching a rule of thumb according to which if Republicans are against a proposal , that means it must be leftist and extreme , and the burden on the White House is to find a way to make the GOP happy . Needless to say , this rewards obstructionism — there is literally nothing Obama can do to convince some ( many ) pundits that he’s making a good faith effort , because they don’t pay any attention to what he does , only to the Republican reaction .Awesome .
Very busy , so no substantive posting today . But I did want to share a thought from the past few days . I posted about the surprisingly good news , at least so far , on Obamacare premiums for 2015 — and as usual was met with a wall of rage from the right . The idea that this thing might be working inspires a level of anger nothing else ( except maybe climate science ) matches .No news there . Nor is it news that such people know things that ain’t so . But there’s something I’ve noticed from the combination of reactions to what I write and researching past coverage of Obamacare . It goes like this : a lot of the untrue beliefs people have about Obamacare come not so much from outright false reporting as from selective reporting . Every suggestion of bad news gets highlighted — especially , of course , but not only by Fox , the WSJ , etc.. But when it turns out that the news wasn’t really that bad , these sources just move on . There are claims that millions of people are losing coverage — headlines ! When it turns out not to be true — crickets ! Some experts claim that premiums will rise by double digits — big news ! Actual premium numbers come in and they’re surprisingly low — not mentioned .The result is that most news consumers — who form impressions rather than trying to work out details — have the sense that it’s been all bad news . This is true even for people who don’t rely on Fox — I get asked about the scary premium hikes by people on the Upper West Side ! And of course for those who do get their news from Fox , well , they know , just know , that Obamacare has reduced the number of Americans with insurance and caused premiums to double or something , even though even their favorite news source isn’t saying such things .We need a term for beliefs based on reports that have been superseded ; maybe fossils instead of zombies . Anyway , it’s striking .
One thing about the Obamacare denialists : they don’t give up . First nobody but the sick would sign up , so we’d have a death spiral . Then it was “OK , a lot of people have signed up , but they won’t pay — and anyway , even more people have lost coverage.” Now they face evidence like this:And the response I’m seeing is “It’s not Obamacare , it’s the improving economy” .But it isn’t . The decline is too sharp , too closely associated with the enrollment period to be driven by the at best gradual improvement in the job market . But wait , there’s more . The Urban Institute breaks down the decline in uninsurance by Medicaid adoption or not , which is closely correlated with the general question of whether states are helping implementation or blocking it . Here’s how it looks:Sorry , an improving economy can’t explain why the decline in uninsured is three times as large in pro-Obamacare states as it is in anti-reform states .It’s the policy , stupid .
President Obama wrote on Monday that the Federal Communications Commission should issue strong regulations to prevent cable and phone companies from dividing the Internet into fast and slow lanes .Writing in more detail than he has offered previously on the subject , Mr. Obama said the commission , which is independent of the administration , should undo a long-standing regulatory mistake by re-classifying broadband Internet service as a telecommunications service , not a lightly-regulated information service . That would allow the commission to ban cable and phone companies from blocking , slowing down or otherwise interfering with the videos , music and other content that their customers access on the Internet . As we wrote in an editorial on Sunday , under current rules companies like Verizon and Time Warner Cable have the right to favor some content over others . For example , they could decide to deliver content from a provider that pays them a fee faster than information from competing services . Such arrangements would limit consumer choice and the ability of start-ups to compete on the Web .“We can not allow Internet service providers ( ISPs ) to restrict the best access or to pick winners and losers in the online marketplace for services and ideas , ” Mr. Obama wrote .Not surprisingly , cable and phone companies and some of their supporters in Congress are not happy with Mr. Obama’s proposal . Comcast issued a statement calling it “a radical reversal that would harm investment and innovation , as today’s immediate stock market reaction demonstrates.” ( Shares of Comcast were down 3.8 percent at noon , but shares in Verizon and AT & T were up slightly . ) Senator Ted Cruz tried , confusingly and desperately , to link Mr. Obama’s proposal to health reform , a favorite whipping boy of Republicans that is actually working quite well:“Net Neutrality” is Obamacare for the Internet ; the Internet should not operate at the speed of government .— Senator Ted Cruz ( @ SenTedCruz ) 10 Nov 14The industry’s concerns are unfounded and self-interested . And the reaction of lawmakers like Mr. Cruz is partisan hyperbole . Mr. Obama made clear that he does not want the F.C.C . to regulate broadband as it regulates traditional telephone service even if it reclassifies it as a telecommunications service . For example , there is no reason for the commission to regulate the price of Internet service , as regulators do for traditional home phone lines .But other telecommunications rules should apply . For example , federal telephone regulations make sure that you can use your AT & T phone to call people using T-Mobile by requiring the companies to connect their networks to each other . The same should be true on the Internet – you should be able to use Netflix just as easily as you would be able to use Amazon’s streaming service .This is at the heart of what Mr. Obama is proposing:For almost a century , our law has recognized that companies who connect you to the world have special obligations not to exploit the monopoly they enjoy over access in and out of your home or business . That is why a phone call from a customer of one phone company can reliably reach a customer of a different one , and why you will not be penalized solely for calling someone who is using another provider . It is common sense that the same philosophy should guide any service that is based on the transmission of information — whether a phone call , or a packet of data .Mr. Obama’s reasoning might not satisfy phone and cable companies or their friends in Congress , who have a visceral allergic reaction to regulations . But that should not stop the F.C.C . from adopting his well-argued proposal .
The politics of Obamacare are clearly starting to shift . It’s not that the public is coming to love it — not yet , anyway . But it’s less and less of a bogeyman , with polls suggesting a majority of the public against flat-out repeal . So there’s increasing pressure on Republicans to lay out an alternative — and continuing surprise about their inability to articulate one .But this is an example of why it sometimes helps , even in straight political reporting , to understand how policy works . Here’s the essential fact about health care policy , which in turn fundamentally shapes health care politics:Obamacare looks the way it does because it has to .Once again , for those who missed it : if you want to cover people with preexisting conditions , you must have community rating . If you want to have community rating without a death spiral — that is , if you want to keep an acceptable risk pool — you have to have an individual mandate . If you want to have an individual mandate , you have to have subsidies for lower-income Americans . And that’s Obamacare : a three-legged stool , with all three legs essential .Republicans can’t offer an alternative because there isn’t one ( aside , that is , from single-payer ) . Their plan , such as it was , was to wait for the plan to implode , so they would never be put on the spot ; since that isn’t happening , Plan B is to bob and weave and avoid the question until the midterms . That’s all there is .
David Brooks : Well , that was pretty much a complete drubbing .Gail Collins : Don’t rub it in , David .David : I guess the Republicans will pick up between eight and 10 Senate seats once the dust settles in Alaska , Virginia and Louisiana . The victories at the gubernatorial level are even more impressive . Scott Walker’s win in Wisconsin was pretty significant . The biggest surprise to me was Larry Hogan getting himself elected governor of thoroughly blue Maryland . Plus Bruce Rauner’s win as governor of Illinois was unexpected and huge . This was a national verdict .Gail : Yeah , things were even worse than I expected . The most depressing result , for me , was Sam Brownback being re-elected governor in Kansas . If you can wreck the state’s economy and not get punished at all — I don’t know what there is to say .David : It seems to me the Republican challenge is to understand what the party has done right without getting carried away by triumphalism . The Democratic challenge is to understand where the party went wrong without giving way to despair . Maybe we can talk about strengths and weaknesses ?Gail : Well , I guess that’s better than staying here under the bed , curled in a fetal position . You first .David : I guess the beginning of Republican wisdom is to understand that this was more a case of the Democrats’ losing this particular election than it was a case of the Republicans winning it . The Democrats have talked a lot about wage stagnation and income inequality but they have offered nothing compelling to address these problems . President Obama lost the House four years ago because he seemed too liberal for the country after the passage of Obamacare . He lost the Senate this year because he seemed too passive , not competent , not in control . The rollout of Obamacare was the crucial moment of his second term .Gail : I agree that the president has often seemed passive . And there’s been a lot of misspeaking for somebody who’s supposed to be a great communicator . But I don’t buy the idea that the Democrats failed to address wage stagnation and income inequality . Raise the minimum wage , create good jobs improve the nation’s roads and bridges , expand quality pre-K programs to give the next generation a boost – that’s pretty much all they talked about .David : The big Republican accomplishment is that they have detoxified their brand . Four years ago they seemed scary and extreme to a lot of people . They no longer seem that way . The wins in purple states like North Carolina , Iowa and Colorado are clear indications that the party can at least gain a hearing among swing voters . And if the G.O.P . presents a reasonable candidate ( and this year’s crop was very good ) , then Republicans can win anywhere . I think we’ve left the Sarah Palin phase and entered the Tom Cotton phase .Gail : I wouldn’t call this year’s crop very good , except in the sense that they’re definitely a less extreme group than we saw in the last few seasons . Although some – like Joni Ernst , who won the Senate seat in Iowa – are still downright scary .But the Republicans have gotten very good at teaching their candidates how to tamp down political screechiness .David : I was especially struck by Ed Gillespie’s amazing showing in Virginia . He ran one of the more policy-oriented campaigns in the country . At a time when consultants around the nation insulted voters’ intelligence with dumb campaigns , he honored their intelligence by talking about policy and was rewarded for it , win or lose . Maybe it takes a guy who has been a professional consultant to not listen to the consultants .Gail : Virginia shocked me . And Kay Hagan’s loss in North Carolina saddened me . The new Democratic South seems to exist mainly in theory .David : Scott Walker’s victory in Wisconsin is also significant . The public is clearly unhappy with public sector unions , even in a traditionally progressive place like Wisconsin . Faced with a budget crisis , a mayor or governor can take on those unions and survive and even thrive . He’ll become a compelling national figure in 2016 .Gail : Yeah , when the only unions left standing are the ones composed of people who work for the taxpayers , the labor movement is in a pretty sad shape . The Republicans have done a very good job of making it almost impossible to organize in the private sector .David : I wouldn’t give up on private sector unions . I suspect some institution will grow up to give workers more bargaining power against employers , even if it doesn’t look like the 20th-century model .Republicans should be wary of over-interpreting their mandate . Scott Brown ran hard against immigration reform and he was a rare Republican loser last night .Gail : That seemed like a weird choice of themes for New Hampshire , but maybe Brown just forgot which state he was campaigning in . I will refrain from making any jokes about how his next move will be to buy a camper and head for California , where Barbara Boxer is up for re-election in 2016 . There will always be a woman running for the Senate somewhere who he can challenge .David : I would love to see a Brown-Boxer race . Sort of a setup for a U.P.S . advertising campaign . The deeper problem for Republicans is their party still has no growth agenda . Figuring out a set of policies commensurate with the size of the structural economic issues is the next big task .Gail : See , that’s the frustrating thing . For the last two years the Senate has had Democratic committee chairs who went out of their way to work with Republicans on economic issues . But they were stonewalled by the Republican leadership . And then the voters blamed the Democratic incumbents for gridlock .David : For Democrats , I guess one big lesson is : Stop talking to each other . Democratic politicians spent the early part of the year running against the Koch brothers . That argument may scare a lot of people in liberal bastions , but no one outside of these bastions knows about them or cares .Gail : It’s totally true that politicians and the media care much more about campaign contributors than voters do I always secretly thought that if God wanted Americans to care about campaign finance reform he would have made it easier to explain . Although there was that one brief , shining moment in 2000 – John McCain . Presidential primary . New Hampshire . Amazing to think back on how that one guy in a bus just went from town meeting to town meeting talking about how to get money out of politics .Gone but not quite forgotten .David : Then the Democrats came back with the 2012 playbook — all the talk about contraception and “women’s” issues . That was tone deaf , given where the country is .Gail : I don’t agree at all . Of course you can’t give the impression that reproductive rights is the only thing you’re running on . But the real problem for the Democrats was that the Republicans figured out how to defuse the issue.Ask me about abortion and I’ll tell you that birth control pills should be sold over the counter .The Democrats aren’t going to have the luxury of running against the kind of Cro-Magnon candidates the Republicans were putting up a few years ago . Although I was tickled to see that the congressman in Florida who held the men-only gathering went down the drain . You know , the one who felt guys needed to be by themselves so they could feel free to drink , smoke and discuss serious topics .David : Democrats also need to ask themselves what it will take for them to be a congressional party once again . That means winning in places likes Arkansas , once solid Democratic states . Over the near term it means shelving theories about an emerging Democratic majority — hoping that a tide of Democratic voters will sweep the Democrats into permanent power . That still may happen over the long term , but Democrats are just terrible at appealing to white voters , especially less-educated white voters .Gail : No matter what the demographics of the future are going to look like , you obviously want candidates who can appeal to poor white and poor minority candidates at the same time . But it’s not easy to do . I don’t think the Republicans are meeting uneducated white voters’ needs . They’re just appealing to their fear of change .David : The core problem for Democrats , it seems to me , is that voters are just too skeptical of government — at least as it currently exists . Obamacare may not have been a huge issue , but Republicans ran lots of ads about it , and it remains deeply unpopular . Democrats somehow need to figure out how to offer government programs when people are innately suspicious of government as something alien and ineffective .Gail : The Republicans have done a terrific job of making their base hate government , even when they benefit greatly from government programs . And it’s ironic that President Obama , who ran as a great communicator , has been so awful at countering that message .David : The final point is that this election marks the end of the Obama presidency’s power on the domestic front . In 2008 , I would not have expected it to come to this . The verdict is still out on what Obama’s legacy will be , but it’s certainly true that he did not succeed where F.D.R. , Reagan and even Clinton did — in building a plausible majority for his party .Gail : I know that the rule of our pundit profession is that now we must turn our attention completely away from the current administration and do nothing but speculate about the presidential race in 2016 . But I want to give Obama a little more time before I declare him a goner . If he leaves behind a national health care program and a significant start to the battle against climate change , he’ll have actually accomplished much more as president than Clinton did . But I guess the nation won’t learn to appreciate him unless he’s impeached .
For reference : I count at least six distinct predictions of Obamacare doom made by the usual suspects , not one of which has come true . Here they are:1 . Enrollment will be very low , and2 . Even if people sign up , they won’t pay their premiums .Reality : Signups exceeded expectations , and the vast majority paid .3 . More people will lose coverage cancelled by Obamacare than gain it .Reality : Sharp drop in the number of uninsured .4 . Rate shock .Reality : Like it says , affordable care .5 . Young people not signing up , and death spiral .Reality : Pretty good demographics .6 . Soaring health costs .Reality : Health costs are below anyone’s expectations .It’s quite an impressive track record , actually . And what’s even more impressive is that none of the usual suspects will even consider admitting having been wrong .
Many news reports are doing their best to somehow spin the final Obamacare surge as a negative story — yes , the website did go down a couple of times due to volume , which never , ever happens to commercial sites . The narrative of Obamacare-as-failure must not be challenged !But the narrative is getting really hard to sustain . Charles Gaba:There’s the usual yammering about “But how many have PAID ? ? ? ” , “But how many were ALREADY INSURED ? ? ? ” , “How many were YOUNG ? ? ? ” and “What METAL LEVEL did they get ? ? ? ” etc etc etc . All of these are reasonable questions for actuarials , accountants and so forth to ask , and the answers will indeed help shape our understanding of what the overall economic and health status of the population at large will be .For the moment , however , none of that matters . This is an outstanding number any way you slice it .Meanwhile , via Wonkbook , a guide to “unskewing” the numbers . Yep , I blame zombie ACORN .
You still encounter people claiming that Obamacare has been a disaster , that more people have lost insurance than gained it , etc. , etc . But the reality is that it has already made a big dent in the number of uninsured ; and the quality of insurance has gone up , too , because canceled policies were canceled because they offered little real protection .Of course , the coming of the law in January 2014 has been a big job-killer .. or maybe not:This is what success looks like .
My Sunday column considered various possible and partial explanations for President Obama’s long year of low approval ratings , which seem likely to help cost his party control of the Senate tomorrow . The big four I considered were structural forces ( the idea that polarization and gridlock alone suffice to send most second-term presidents regressing to the low 40s ) , the essential mediocrity of our “recovered” economy , the continued unpopularity of Obamacare , and foreign policy ( where the president’s approval ratings have fallen hard ) as a kind of synecdoche for larger doubts about the administration’s basic competence . Obviously there are many more factors one could consider , but since I write about the issue frequently I thought I should explain why I didn’t include immigration , another area where the president’s approval numbers have plummeted as his administration has stumbled in various ways over the last year .My reasoning , basically , was similar to the reasoning I use when analyzing the commonplace claim that immigration is about to doom Republicans forever : I just don’t see a lot of evidence that the issue usually moves that many votes , white or Hispanic or otherwise , no matter which way it happens to be cutting at the moment . It’s true that recent events ( the child migrant surge , the White House’s strange handling of its promised amnesty , the climate of Ebola-related anxiety ) have made the politics of immigration for favorable to conservatives than they were a couple of years ago , and the failure to pass immigration reform probably contributes something to Hispanic disappointment with the president . But I still feel that immigration is ultimately more a kind of subplot within the broader categories my column proposed — one reason among many to be anxious about presidential competence , or one reason among many to blame Obama for gridlock — than an issue that deserves pride of place in analyzing the president’s weakened position .Some evidence : If you look at some recent polls on voter priorities , immigration is ( of course ) swamped by the economy , but it also tends to be cited only about half as often the national security/international affairs/terrorism nest of issues , which I think has played a much larger role in undercutting the public’s approval of the president . Likewise , if you look at this feature that maps midterm-election conversations on social media , you’ll see immigration getting significant play mostly in districts in the south and west that are already “overwhelmingly represented by Republicans , ” rather than dominating the conversation in swing states . Again , that doesn’t mean it’s an inconsequential issue , but it does make me doubt its distinctive power over the president’s ( un ) popularity and his party’s midterm fate .I could be wrong , of course . If I were inclined to play Mickey Kaus for a day and elevate immigration’s significance a little higher , it would be on the grounds that the immigration debate is an important case study in just how easily cracks can can open up within the president’s 2008/2012 majority , and how the Democratic Party’s diversity-as-strength approach to coalition-building can turn into ex uno plures in a hurry . That is , up until recently , immigration was a policy area where the president was able to successfully promise a great deal to his base without paying any kind of major price among swing voters — because what he was promising to activists ( the DREAM Act ) was pretty popular and didn’t conflict with his parallel strategy of touting deportation numbers and an allegedly-secured border , because there’s broad support for some kind of immigration compromise and most voters aren’t exactly detail-oriented , and because the G.O.P.’s consultants were terrified of contesting the issue . But once the border started to look less secure ( in part , perhaps , because of DREAM-created incentives ) and activists started demanding something much bigger ( the sweeping executive amnesty that the White House seemed poised to offer , than walked back ) , Obama’s two-step turned into something that cost him with the base and the middle … effectively undoing one of his most successful first term strategies , emboldening Republicans to criticize his policies rather than just promising compromise or ducking , and opening space between the so-called “coalition of the ascendant” and the older , whiter voters the Democrats still need to win in , say , Iowa .I think this analysis has some merit ( not surprisingly , since I just spun it ) ; I just don’t think it proves immigration’s major salience in knocking down the president’s approval ratings and/or influencing this cycle . But we’ll get an interesting test in New Hampshire , where Scott Brown has campaigned heavily on the issue ; if he pulls out an upset , my estimation of immigration’s impact on Obama’s swoon and 2014’s outcomes will go up . And whether it explains a lot or just a little of Obama’s struggles , the way the issue has played out over the last 18 months does potentially foreshadow similar/broader difficulties for the Democratic coalition as it moves into the post-Obama era , in ways that I’m sure I’ll have reason to discuss again .
LEXINGTON , Ky. – Political campaigns aren’t generally associated with specificity or truth-telling and political debates are no different . But at Monday night’s debate in Lexington , both Senator Mitch McConnell and his Democratic challenger , Alison Lundergan Grimes , the Kentucky Secretary of State , reached absurd heights in the art of weasel-wording .Ms. Grimes knew the question was coming , since she’s fielded it several times in the last few days . The host of the debate , Bill Goodman , asked Ms. Grimes for whom she’d voted in the 2012 presidential election . I’ll take a wild guess here that Ms. Grimes , a Democrat who was a member of the Kentucky delegation to the Democratic National Convention two years ago , went for the Democrat : Barack Obama . But she refused to say — because she’s petrified of being linked with the president , who is deeply unpopular in Kentucky . Instead , she took umbrage on the grounds that the Kentucky constitution guarantees ballot box secrecy . She actually made the preposterous claim that by ducking the question she was standing on constitutional principle .Mr. McConnell then made her look foolish by freely sharing his votes in the 2008 and 2012 presidential contests , as well as in the 2010 Senate race , when he voted for Trey Grayson , who lost to Rand Paul , the Tea Party darling .Mr. McConnell , who’s been in Washington long enough —30 years — to know how to speak without communicating any information , had plenty of opportunity to show off his considerable obfuscation skills .Is the minimum wage a living wage , Mr. Goodman asked Mr. McConnell . “It’s an entry-level wage , ” said Mr. McConnell , hardly an answer .Is climate change real ? Before he could plead that he was “not a scientist , ” Mr. Goodman pointed out that although the senator was not an economist , he was willing to share his opinions on the economy . In a tight spot , Mr. McConnell said : “There are a bunch of scientists who feel there is a problem and maybe we can do something about it.”Lest he be accused of siding with environmentalists , he added the caveat that scientists in the 1970s thought we were moving toward an ice age , and closed by declaring that his job , as United States Senator from Kentucky , was to fight for coal jobs in the state .Mr. McConnell approached Ms. Grimes’s “ballot box secrecy”-level of absurdity when Mr. Goodman asked him if “Obamacare and Kynect” had been “a boon or bane” for the state . The difficulty for Mr. McConnell is that the Affordable Care Act is politically toxic in Kentucky , while Kynect — which is the state’s health insurance program created under the Affordable Care Act — is a runaway success .Mr. McConnell’s attempt to separate the two made no sense . The Affordable Care Act should be “pulled out root and branch.” As for Kynect , that’s just “a website . It was paid for by a grant . The website can continue.”Seeking clarity , Mr. Goodman asked if Mr. McConnell would support the continuation of Kynect . “Yeah , I think it’s fine to have a website , yeah , ” said the senator .That’s like saying that Google should cease to exist but that Google.com should live on .
Gail Collins : David , I was pretty confident that the United States had Ebola under control until the other day , when it appeared policy-making had devolved to Andrew Cuomo and Chris Christie . Chris Christie , who can’t keep bridge traffic moving . Andrew Cuomo , who failed to get his 2012 flu shot until 2013 .David Brooks : This is why we’re a republic and not a democracy . People running for office should not be making science policy . By the way , I’ve been against quarantines and overreaction through this whole thing , but there was a piece in The New Republic a few weeks ago that sobered me . Steven Beutler , an infectious disease specialist , was arguing for a maximalist response . Here’s one core point : “Medicine can be a very humbling profession , and after more than 30 years of practicing infectious-disease medicine , I have learned that the ‘unanticipated’ happens all too often , especially where microbes are involved.”Gail : Do you think the Ebola hysteria will have any effect on next week’s election ? There’s been a lot of complaint about the administration’s ineptitude . But I think the message on Ebola , at least , has been the opposite . Ebola in the United States began deep in the heart of Texas , a state whose health care system is so estranged from the federal government it refuses to accept the opportunity to get its millions of uninsured residents covered under Obamacare .David : Your love of all things Texas is well known . But you have to admit a few things about the place . It is economically vibrant beyond all reckoning . Houston and Dallas are exploding economically while the rest of the country dawdles .Gail : Texas is the last gasp of the Sunbelt boom . It has all the advantages of warm weather , plus an enormous amount of space which makes housing stupendously cheap . It could have done just as well without being politically crazy .But we were talking about Ebola .David : As for Ebola and the election , my pretentious theory is that Ebola is the objective correlative of the campaign .Gail : You’re using big words again .David : If I remember high school English correctly , an “objective correlative” is an object that gives explicit access to the meaning of vague and insubstantial things , like a mood or an emotion . It’s an object that correlates to a mood or emotion or idea . T.S . Eliot made it famous writing about Hamlet .Anyway , the country was already afraid . It felt like the people running things were not quite up to the job . Along comes a disease to perfectly embody that vague sense . That said , I don’t think Ebola is swinging too many votes . People are just sour and they are disappointed with the president .Gail : It certainly has been a tough season for President Obama . But before we start blaming him for anything bad that happens next Tuesday , I would like to give him a shout-out for that hug-the-Ebola-nurse photo . Which allows us to recall that when AIDS hit the United States in 1981 , President Ronald Reagan was criminally useless . Never said a word . As Laura Helmuth noted in Slate this week , Reagan’s press secretary made fun of the idea that the president would ever consider speaking out .David : I totally agree with you on that one . It’s not in the president’s job description to be the professional emoter and behavior model , but when he can display some truth by example , he might as well do it .Gail : I know I’m preparing my defenses in advance of next week . But I think the American people have been saying they want an effective government , not a smaller government . All the candidates are promising they’re going to end gridlock , but if there’s anything we’ve learned since Obama was elected , it’s that you don’t end gridlock by sending more Tea Party types to Washington .David : I guess I think it is more generalized than that . They just don’t trust government to get the job done . At least the federal government . I’m struck by how amazingly stable polling has been on the Affordable Care Act . Democrats in swing states don’t try to defend it . They just promise to fix it . The relatively good news on the health care front over the past year has done nothing to change minds .Gail : I find it sort of fascinating that the Republican Senate nominee in Iowa , who previously said she’d support a law to have federal officials arrested for attempting to implement Obamacare , is marketing herself as the “Iowa nice” candidate who can work across the aisle .David : I find it shocking that Iowans should steal Minnesota’s slogan . Minnesota is the nice state . Missouri is the skeptical state . New Jersey is the brash state . Iowa should be the quiet state .In her defense I think it is possible to arrest federal officials nicely . We call it compassionate conservatism .Gail : O.K. , this is the point at which we’re morally obliged to start making predictions . What’s yours ?David : I say this with no great confidence , but I’m guessing the Republicans pick up eight seats . I think the biggest surprise will be a G.O.P . win in Georgia .Gail : That would make me sad , if only because Michelle Nunn has run such a good race and her opponent has been so terrible . It just seems unjust .My guess is that we’re not going to know who gets control of the Senate for a while . Some state is going to be so close there’ll be a recount . And Alaska takes forever to just get the ballots together . Plus Georgia and Louisiana , which will probably go to runoffs , since they require their senators to get a majority of the vote .David : Great ! Why shouldn’t the decade’s most content-less campaign go into overtime ? I’m sort of amazed that this election hasn’t been about jobs and the economy . It hasn’t been about anything but a sort of fatalism .Gail : There’s something about the idea of the fate of the nation hanging on Louisiana that makes me very nervous . I still remember being down there in 1991 , covering the gubernatorial runoff between the Ku Klux Klan wizard David Duke and the deeply corrupt ex-governor Edwin Edwards . The Edwards supporters had those bumper stickers saying : “Vote for the Crook.” Which , blessedly , the people did .David : I’ll take an effective crook over an ineffective honest person any day .Gail : I should mention that at age 87 , Edwards is running for the House of Representatives this year . After getting out of jail , marrying a woman 51 years younger , and starring in a reality TV series . You can’t say Louisiana isn’t interesting . And if there’s a runoff at least then we’d be able to spend part of the winter in New Orleans . So much better than next year , when we’ll be spending it in Des Moines .David : I was just in New Orleans last week . I love every street in that city except Bourbon Street , which is filled with terrible pizza places , extremely drunk idiots and teenagers mortified to be walking with their parents .Gong there makes me want to reread my favorite political novel of all time , Robert Penn Warren’s “All the King’s Men.” Trollope’s “Phineas Finn” is second .And don’t knock Des Moines . Silence is golden .Gail : What’s the state you’re following most closely ? I have to admit Kansas is pretty darned fascinating . If the Republicans have to ferry in any more old party stalwarts to shore up Senator Pat Roberts , they’ll be resurrecting Alf Landon .I got a twinge watching Bob Dole campaign so vigorously for Roberts . Do you remember in 2012 when Dole was sitting in the Senate , in his wheelchair , watching his friends refuse to ratify the United Nations treaty on people with disabilities ? Which was based , of course , on the signature bill Dole got passed in 1990 when he was in the Senate .David : Somebody should please explain to me why senators don’t ever want to retire . What’s fun about attending Ag Committee hearings when you are 84 ? Maybe the napping opportunities .Gail : I talked with Dole after the treaty vote , and he kept coming back to the fact that both of the Republican Senators from Kansas had voted against ratification . But there’s Roberts now , in a deep ditch because he took his constituents so much for granted he didn’t even bother to pretend he lived in their state . Dole clearly has a much deeper sense of loyalty .David : I once went to the Dole center in Kansas . They’ve got a sort of museum display about his life . The thing that moved me most was the exercise equipment he used to build himself back into shape after his war injury . He had wasted away to nothing and had to build himself all the way back . Then I got to see the basement where they keep all the presents he had been given by foreign dignitaries during his Senate years . There were carpets , saddles , baseball bats . People give politicians portraits of themselves . I guess that’s called knowing your subject .Gail : It’s interesting how many elections there are this year where voters seem to despise both candidates . If Floridians were any more alienated by their governor’s race , they’d have been bringing alligators to the debates .David : I don’t think Floridians should be angry or alienated . It doesn’t suit them . Among other things , it doesn’t go with their pastels .Gail : I don’t want anybody to imagine that I’m making fun of other states because of my deep satisfaction with New York . Nothing is more humbling than spending a season covering New York politics . Where the phrase “not yet indicted” is regarded as a compliment .David : If Minnesota is nice and Iowa is quiet , what should New York be : Pompous ? Narcissistic ? I say this lovingly . It is my state too .Gail : Last question . Is there anything about this election that’s really surprised you ? I didn’t expect to see so much of Mitt Romney on the campaign trail . Do you think he’s actually interested in running again ? They say third time’s a charm .David : Trust me . He isn’t running . I think his wife sort of ruled that out . That documentary released after the election revealed him to be an authentically warm and nice guy . If there are three things that don’t seem to work in politics these days it’s authenticity , niceness and warmth . Doesn’t fit the national mood .
The Kaiser Family Foundation has a new survey ( pdf ) on Obamacare in California , and it’s full of remarkably good news . For those who haven’t been following this , CA — with its now-dominant Democratic Party — is where Obamacare was implemented the way it was supposed to be implemented : the website worked pretty well from the beginning , Medicaid expansion was implemented , and the state worked hard on outreach . It was also a place that really needed reform : the uninsured were a high percentage of the population , and an individual market without community rating meant that the mere hint of a preexisting condition was enough to prevent coverage .So it now appears that most of California’s uninsured — 58 percent of the total , or well over 60 percent of those eligible ( because undocumented immigrants aren’t covered ) have gained insurance in the first year . Considering the complexity of the scheme , that’s really impressive , and it strongly suggests that next year , once those who missed out have had a chance to learn via word of mouth , California will have gotten much of the way toward universal coverage for legal residents .But there’s something else the Kaiser report drives home : most of those gaining coverage are doing so not via the exchanges ( although those are important too ) but via Medicaid . And that’s important as an answer to critics of Obamacare from the left .There have always been critics complaining that what we really should have is single-payer , and angry that subsidies were being funneled through the insurance companies . And in principle they’re right ; the trouble was that cutting the insurers out of the loop would have made the plan politically impossible , both because of the industry’s power and because of the unwillingness of people with good coverage to take a leap into a completely new system . So we got this awkward public-private hybrid , which I supported because it was what we could get and despite its impurity it dramatically improves many people’s lives .But it turns out that many of the newly insured are in fact being covered under a single-payer system — Medicaid . And as I’ve pointed out before,Medicaid is actually the piece of the US system that looks most like European health systems , which cost far less than ours while delivering comparable results .All in all , liberals really should be celebrating . California shows how Obamacare can and should work , and it’s looking pretty good .
Greg Sargent notes that the midterm election , which was supposed to be a referendum on Obamacare , isn’t looking at all like that in practice ; Republican ads denouncing health reform have been dwindling month by month .The reason is fairly obvious , although it’s not considered nice to state it bluntly : the attack on Obamacare depended almost entirely on lies , and those lies are becoming unsustainable now that the law is actually working . No , there aren’t any death panels ; no , huge numbers of Americans aren’t losing coverage or finding their health costs soaring ; no , jobs aren’t being killed in vast numbers . A few relatively affluent , healthy people are paying more for coverage ; a few high-income taxpayers are paying more in taxes ; a much larger number of Americans are getting coverage that was previously unavailable and/or unaffordable ; and most people are seeing no difference at all , except that they no longer have to fear what happens if they lose their current coverage .In other words , reform is working more or less the way it was supposed to ( except for the Medicaid expansion in non-cooperating states ) .Many of us argued all along that the right’s chance to kill reform would vanish once the program was actually in place ; the horror stories only worked as long as the truth wasn’t visible . And that’s what seems to be happening .
These are tough times for opponents of health care reform . They bet everything on a debacle , but Obamacare has failed to fail — and their efforts to deny the increasingly obvious success of the law are beginning to look ridiculous .Oh , and they can’t come up with a conservative alternative ; Obamacare IS the conservative alternative , a way to achieve sorta-kinda universal coverage without single payer , and all of its main elements are essential parts of the package .So what’s left ? Claims that guaranteed health insurance is an assault on America’s freedom .Bill Gardner at The Incidental Economist offers a rather decorous , mild reply to the people making this argument . I’d put it more forcefully : the pre-ACA system drastically restricted many people’s freedom , because given the extreme dysfunctionality of the individual insurance market , they didn’t dare leave jobs ( or in some cases marriages ) that came with health insurance . Now that affordable insurance is available even if you don’t have a good job at a big company , many Americans will feel liberated — and this hugely outweighs the minor infringement on freedom caused by the requirement that people buy insurance . ( Also , if you don’t like the mandate , why not support single payer ? )But no discussion of this latest argument should fail to mention the original insurance-is-slavery campaign — Operation Coffeecup , in which the AMA recruited doctors’ wives to gather their friends and listen to a recording of Ronald Reagan declaring that Medicare would destroy American liberty .Strange to say , that didn’t happen . And Obamacare won’t turn into a form of slavery , either . On the contrary , as I said , it will be a liberating force for many Americans .
The good news for Obamacare just keeps coming in . Via Charles Gaba , the Rand Survey — which was the subject of a report in the LA Times , but which wasn’t publicly available — is now in . And it says that as of mid-March — that is , before the final enrollment surge — the Affordable Care Act had already produced a net gain of 9.3 million insured adults . Again , that’s a net gain ; so much for claims that more people are losing insurance than gaining it .At least some Republicans are realizing that ( a ) the ACA is not going to collapse and ( b ) they can’t simply take away insurance from millions of Americans . So they have to come up with an alternative .And as Sahil Kapur reports , at least a few of them are coming to a terrible realization : there is no alternative . You can’t just support the popular pieces of reform , in particular coverage for preexisting conditions , and scrap the rest . As Jonathan Gruber taught me , and I and others have said many times , reform is a three-legged stool that requires community rating , the individual mandate , and subsidies ; take away any leg and it collapses . And Kapur finds a GOP aide who admits to the awful truth : any workable GOP plan would look pretty much the same as Obamacare .I don’t know how many GOP leaders , as opposed to aides , understand this . And even those who do won’t dare to admit it . The party line , literally , has been that Obamacare is an unworkable monstrosity , and the base will destroy anyone who points out , this late in the game , that it’s both workable and pretty much the only doable alternative to single-payer .And if that’s not a case of politics making people stupid , I don’t know what is..
On Monday , I wrote that the apparent stabilization of Obamacare sharpens the political and policy challenge facing the law’s critics . Instead of the sort of easy unraveling that some Republicans had convinced themselves was in the offing , I argued ( in a point made rather more forcefully by Ramesh Ponnuru ) that it’s now much more likely that the only way the things conservatives dislike about Obamacare will ever change or go away is if conservatives actually unite around reforms or a replacement that sustains some of the current law’s coverage expansion ( albeit on significantly different terms ) .My sense is that some Republicans half-agree . That is , they’re willing to concede that the party needs an Obamacare replacement that’s more serious than some of the G.O.P.’s circa-2009 alternatives . But they also think the law will remain so unpopular , and that the number of losers will exceed the number of winners so dramatically , that conservative policymakers will have more room to maneuver , in terms of the initial coverage numbers a replacement might sustain , than my reading of the situation would suggest .The health care reform proposal rolled out by Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal this week offers a specific example of how this perspective cashes out . Unlike some other recent Republican proposals ( most notably , the bill co-sponsored in the Senate earlier this year ) , which promise tax cuts and savings relative to current policy , Jindal’s proposal explicitly starts with the 2008 baseline , and promises not to tax or spend a dollar more . His proposed reform would convert the open-ended deduction for employer-provided insurance into a flat deduction , extend the same deduction to people outside the employer market , and channel $ 100 billion over ten years to the states to provide for high-risk pools and other measures to help cover people with pre-existing conditions . What it conspicuously wouldn’t do is create the kind of tax credit for catastrophic coverage that you’ll often find in right-of-center health care alternatives — because that would cost money relative to the 2008 baseline , and/or require further disruptions elsewhere in the system . Which means , in turn , that if you replaced Obamacare with Jindalcare in 2017 , you’d see a coverage expansion relative to the Bush era , but a large number of the newly-insured would lose coverage without any immediate prospect of regaining it .Jindal was in D.C. yesterday to talk about his plan ( full disclosure , I was there ) , and the Washington Examiner’s Philip Klein has a good write-up of how he responded to , shall we say , pushback on this point:Jindal was pressed on why he chose to offer a tax deduction for individuals to purchase insurance rather than a refundable tax credit . Supporters of the tax credit approach argue that it would benefit more people , because lower-income Americans don’t pay enough taxes for the deduction to be valuable enough to make insurance premiums affordable .He said that he decided on the deduction approach because relying on tax credits would be so costly that it would require tax increases – and Jindal doesn’t want his plan to spend more or tax more than the system that existed prior to Obamacare’s passage . He also argued that credits would cause more disruption to the employer-based market and would be more prone to fraud .He said that whatever amounts of money conservatives were willing to allocate to address a problem , Democrats would always be willing to spend more , so conservatives can not get into a bidding war .Jindal cited previous estimates of similar reform proposals to his own , which he said could reduce family health insurance premiums by $ 5,000 annually and increase coverage by 9 million people relative to the number of people who were covered prior to Obamacare .“I don’t think conservative health care reform is about saying we’re going to compete with them in terms of how many people we say have an insurance card , ” he said . “That’s not the ultimate goal.”So obviously the governor and I have a substantive disagreement here : Like Jindal , I’m deeply skeptical of the “give everyone a Medicaid card” approach to health care reform , but that skepticism pushes me toward supporting a basic catastrophic protection ( and other reforms ) instead , rather than toward just accepting , for the foreseeable future , a health insurance marketplace that prices a lot of working class Americans out of affordable coverage of any sort .But for the purposes of this post , I’m more interested in the politics of the debate . Politically , I don’t think there’s any question that Jindal’s argument — go back to the pre-Obamacare baseline , expand coverage modestly relative to that — would play well with at least part of the G.O.P . electorate in a primary campaign . For a case , contra myself and Ponnuru , that it could also play pretty well in the general election and in a subsequent legislative battle , here’s Ben Domenech , writing in yesterday’s edition of his newsletter The Transom:… when President Obama sold his health care law to the American people , he sold it to them primarily on the basis of cost . He did this because the polling was so unanimous : people weren’t demanding massive increased regulation of the insurance marketplace to achieve any particular moral goal about coverage levels or anything of the sort – the vast majority of Americans just cared that their premiums cost too much . So Obama made the case for his law based not on increasing coverage , but on decreasing costs – and along the way , he promised that no one would lose their doctor , their plan , or see worse coverage because of his law . In each case , his case was in line with the polling data on what the American people wanted .But what about making the case for health policy reforms in the post-Obamacare era ? For most center-right health policy experts and opinion-makers , the assumption has taken hold that coverage levels must be sustained or even increased under any comparable reform . They believe the argument in favor of universal coverage has been lost , and that any plan which kicks people off of an entitlement program is doomed to fail , politically .This is an assumption held by most people in Washington and the media . But I wonder how accurate it is . Post-Obamacare polling data on this question is lacking , but given the behavior of so many individuals and entities in reaction to Obamacare it’s possible that the bulk of Americans still hold the same views they did prior to the law’s passage : that they want to retain their current plans , that they dislike disruption in their insurance experience , but that most of all , they want lower costs for themselves , not broader coverage for everybody else .I agree that support for universal coverage has tended to be soft , rising when it seems theoretical and then diminishing when the trade-offs actually present themselves . But my expectation is that with Obamacare in place , the psychology of loss aversion changes this calculus in two ways . First , indirectly — because it seems worse to most people to lose a benefit than to have never enjoyed it , voters will feel more morally uncomfortable supporting a candidate who promises to strip other people’s coverage than they would have felt voting for a candidate who opposed the expansion originally . And second , directly — because over the next few years , even voters who dislike Obamacare and aren’t getting subsidies are likely to internalize the idea that they now have an additional backstop in the event of job-loss or illness , and so voting to roll the program back completely and start afresh without that backstop will , again , be more unpopular than never creating it in the first place would have been . ( The consistent presence , in most polls , of an anti-Obamacare demographic that prefer changes to outright repeal suggests to me that the idea of maintaining some kind of quasi-universal guarantee has relatively strong appeal . )I’d also make a broader point : Yes , the health care law remains unpopular , but it was unpopular in 2012 as well , and the economy was worse , and the Republican nominee still went down to defeat — not least , I would submit , because of the perception that he couldn’t be trusted to safeguards the interests of the non-rich . So even if people generally care more about cost than coverage , it still seems quite likely that this fatal impression of the party’s priorities would be accentuated , rather than diminished , in a 2016 campaign where the Republican nominee would be quite directly promising to drive the uninsured rate up .My expectation could be confounded , I concede , if the next few years are a true disaster of spiking premiums and stagnant newly-insured numbers . And I would certainly agree with Domenech that the structure of the law is a lot more vulnerable than exuberant liberals seem to think this week .But I also think that in political terms , it’s actually slightly crazy for Republicans to bet this way given the other options available to them . The Jindal theory , that the right shouldn’t bother competing with liberals on certain policy fronts because they’ll always be outbid , is generally problematic ( why does his proposal have any coverage expansion , then ? ) but it’s a particularly odd idea to embrace in a case where the liberal program may not , as even its defenders allow , actually end up delivering the scale of coverage expansion that was expected .By which I mean that if the current enrollment trends persist , there is a good chance that some version of a more catastrophic-focused reform could actually enroll somewhat more Americans in some kind of basic coverage than Obamacare , at a substantially lower cost . ( A preliminary private score of the Senate Republican bill suggested it could get slightly higher coverage numbers , and that was — I believe — using the C.B.O . projections for Obamacare , which may turn out to have been too high . ) Which in turn would offer Republicans an opportunity to effectively outbid the Democrats on enrollment while significantly underbidding them on spending . ( The Democrats could , of course , counter with single-payer — but the G.O.P . should want to provoke that debate ! ) And to pass up that unusual opportunity in favor of a probably-doomed fidelity to a nearly decade-old baseline … well , I suppose it would be very much like the Republican Party I’ve come to know and love so well .
Gail Collins : David , you’ve been enthusiastic about the Senate race in Kansas , where an independent , Greg Orman , became a surprise front-runner . Now the same kind of thing seems to be happening in South Dakota . Are you excited ?David Brooks : Have you ever heard of negative panic ? In times of chaos or extreme excitement , before a fire or an oncoming tornado , some people act with extreme calm , as if everything is normal . Their brains just don’t know how to handle the extreme circumstances so they pretend those circumstances don’t exist . Many people die because they don’t take the simple evasive action that would save their lives .I am so excited by the prospect of an independent candidate in South Dakota that I am behaving as if everything is normal . I give off the appearance of extreme calm . But deep down I’m rippling with excitement . Next to me John Thune and Tom Daschle seem manic .Gail : I may have gotten carried away . I remember now that I recently humiliated myself by announcing how thrilled I was by a Senate candidate debate in Iowa .But we’ve only got three more weeks of this election season , so you have to humor me . In South Dakota , Mike Rounds , the Republican Senate candidate , was supposed to win . Then he got mired in a scandal . It’s one of those extremely complicated matters that we in the media try to summarize with a phrase like “allegations of corruption.”David : Do you know that South Dakota was the last state among the 48 that I have visited ? Now I’ve been there a few times . What impresses me about the place is that the eastern and western sides of the state are rivals with each other . You’d think that there would be so much resentment north/south in the Dakotas that they wouldn’t have time for east/west . I guess the winters are long .I don’t know why I mention this except that I think people would be more forgiving toward Mike Rounds if there was more of a love-thy-neighbor mentality .Gail : Well , Rounds hasn’t run any attack ads because he feels South Dakotans don’t like that tone . Although to be fair , until recently he didn’t think he had any competition . People who are basically running unopposed love the high road .The Democrat , Rick Weiland , has been running as a populist-liberal , and until recently the national party rewarded him for his principled candidacy by ignoring his race entirely . Then Larry Pressler , a former Republican senator now turned independent , began to get traction . Now anything seems possible .David : I love the fact that Pressler is back , once again disproving the most untrue truism in American literature , that there are no second acts in American life .Gail : Oh my gosh , I totally agree with you . Bill Clinton alone has had about fifteen second acts .David : Pressler is on his seventh or eighth act . The guy was a Rhodes Scholar , a Vietnam vet . He first entered Congress before Jimmy Carter was president . That’s a long time ago . He was also the senator who came off looking good during the Abscam scandal . Here’s a passage from a 1980 Washington Post story:“Thanks to the F.B.I.’s undercover ‘sting’ operation , there now exists incontrovertible evidence that one senator would not be bought . Preserved among the videotape footage that may be used as bribery evidence against a number of members of Congress , there is a special moment in which Sen. Larry Pressler ( R-SD ) tells the undercover agents , in effect , to take their sting and stick it . Pressler , according to law enforcement sources , was the one approached member of Congress who flatly refused to consider financial favors in exchange for legislative favors , as suggested by undercover agents posing as Arabs . At the time he said he was not aware that he was doing anything quite so heroic.”Gail : I do love listening to you read the news . And you brought back Abscam ! It’s comforting , at minimum , to know there was at least one senator who didn’t immediately buy the phony-sheikh hustle .David : So yes , I guess I have a soft spot for a guy like that who wants to re-enter the Senate . That said , I think it will be hard to stay up in the polls once the other guys set their sights on him .Gail : So we agree South Dakota is – yes ! – exciting . And I know you like the idea of electing bipartisan independents .Here’s what worries me about that . There are already two official independents in the Senate , Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine . Suppose we wound up with a Senate that was 48-48-4 ? If the independents formed their own little caucus , they’d have the deciding votes on everything . The fate of every bill and nomination would depend on four guys from Kansas , South Dakota , Vermont and Maine . Four people whose states represent less than 2 percent of the American population .David : Are you worried about this because the United States Senate is not a model of legislative excellence ? I of course think the Senate is way more polarized than the country so it would be a good thing to have a little ballast in the center . Even if that ballast does come from extremely even-tempered states .Gail : Do you think South Dakotans will be troubled by the fact that the independent Senate candidate Larry Pressler seems to actually live in Washington , D.C ? At least he rents an apartment in Sioux Falls , which is more than Pat Roberts , the endangered Kansas senator , bothered to do .David : I wished all senators lived in D.C. Congress worked better when its members couldn’t fly home every week . I don’t think it’s the time at home that ruins them ; it’s the airport food .I know people like me are always saying this , but I do think if members of the Senate were here for more than three days at a stretch they would actually learn to like each other a little more . Plus , members of Congress are not primarily in office to directly represent their constituents ; they are in Congress to offer their best judgments on the issues of the day .Gail : Well , sort of . Until the budget or the farm bill comes out , and everybody’s trying to figure out what it means to the folks in East Cupcake .We do have a lot of close races that are roiled by residency issues this year . Besides South Dakota and Kansas , there’s Louisiana , where Senator Mary Landrieu’s official state residence is in her parents’ house . And in Alaska , the Republican Senate candidate is getting criticized for having what might be called shallow Alaskan roots .David : We’ve got to start paying these people more . With Washington real estate prices shooting toward N.Y.C . levels , it’s expensive to maintain a home there and a house back in the home state . I really think this residency business is a crazy issue .Gail : Maybe we could put up dorms . Nice big ones like colleges have for married graduate students .This is the point at which I get nostalgic and recall that in one of the first elections I ever covered , one of the big issues was whether the voting address of the incumbent was actually a North Haven , Connecticut , Burger King outlet .David : I didn’t know Chris Christie began his career in Connecticut .Gail : Ach , low blow .But it still seems to me that people are better off choosing between two parties that have reasonably clear , competing agendas — plus the ability , at least in theory , to deliver on some of their promises .David : If one party or another had a total grip on the truth I’d agree with you . Hard issues usually require a balancing between competing values and competing legitimate interests . Independents , if they know their job , can help find this balance . If they don’t know their job they just waffle in the middle .Gail : Well , I do admit that the last several seasons in Washington have not done a whole lot for my let-the-parties-deliver theory .David : So true .Gail : Maybe the good news from this election season is that Obamacare is fading as an issue . Can you foresee a time when the House will give up voting several dozen times a season to repeal it and actually start working with the other party to fix its weak spots ?I don’t want to force your opinion , but maybe I should point out that there are a lot of us who would grab onto a positive response as a tiny glimmer of hope in an otherwise hopeless election season .David : Sorry . I do think health care inflation is declining , which is fabulous news , either because of Obamacare or some other reason . But I’m afraid this issue will be with us forever . When Larry Pressler stages his next comeback in 2056 , we’ll still be talking about it .
As we await an official presidential response to last night’s Democratic debacle , here are two quotes that seem likely to frame the political class’s discussion of how the president might respond . First , from Politico , days before the drubbing , when the White House could still hope for just a modest setback at the polls:Administration officials tell us that Obama’s political and policy teams are planning a big counterattack if the Republicans win the Senate—introducing a slate of legislative proposals and executive actions on immigration , infrastructure and early childhood education that are popular with the Democratic base and that he will dare the GOP to oppose .And second , from an anonymous Dem bigwig talking to Business Insider last night:
I love voting . I love pretty much everything about it . My polling place is and has been for many years the Alfred E. Smith School , P.S . 163 , an elementary school . The voting booths are arrayed around a mottled , parquet gym floor , and there are always mothers running a bake sale outside to raise money for the school .Up until a few years ago , we voted on huge , metal machines that seemed like relics from the first days of the industrial age . Exercising the franchise was a pleasing combination of sacred civic ritual and theatricality . You waited in line , gave your name , signed the voting rolls , then were ushered behind a curtain that you closed by slamming a red-handled lever big enough to have served as a prop in “Modern Times” to one side . You flicked more mechanical switches to choose your candidates behind the curtain — a rare oasis of total privacy out in public Manhattan . You could even change your mind and flip them back , at least until the end , when you gave the lever a satisfying slam back the other way , and the curtain slid open . You half-expected the Wizard of Oz to appear .Now that was casting a vote !That’s all changed , thanks to our supposed concern about voter fraud . Since New York instituted its new , computerized voting system , the way things work are as follows : We line up to give our names and get a ballot . We then go a second line for the next available , barely private voting “booth” — in reality a table with a sort of sneeze guard around three sides . When we’re finished , we line up a third time to run our ballots through the next available computer , which assures us that our votes have been registered as we wanted , although who can possibly say . Knowing how protected vital American computer systems are against hackers , I’m waiting for the Election Day the screen tells me my candidate is stuck in Nigeria , and desperately needs a money order to get home and take office .The whole process not only takes three lines — something New Yorkers just love — and is barely private . Volunteers at the polls can easily see whom you voted for at the computers , and often must run the ballots through the scanners for the more elderly or infirm voters . So much for the sanctity of the ballot . The bake sales are still great , though .The lines were fairly sparse at the Smith school today , which inevitably led me to think back to the very long lines and the wild enthusiasm that imbued our first opportunity to vote for Barack Obama for president , in 2008 .“All politics is national” now , which made this midterm election yet another referendum on President Obama , and it has turned out to be another overwhelming repudiation of the president , who already suffered one debacle back in 2010 .This appears to have been a baffling rejection to this supremely detached president , whose supporters have been protesting that the public just does not appreciate all he has done — a list that invariably includes Obamacare , a revived stock market and an unemployment mark that has inched slowly downward .What the White House doesn’t seem to appreciate is just how little a dent this has made in the devastating loss of wealth , security and opportunity so many Americans have experienced in the last few years . But this administration has also been afflicted almost from the start with the inability to decide just whom it is trying to appeal to .Like Bill Clinton before him , this New Democrat president early on dismissed traditional liberals as “professional leftists” as his first press secretary once put it . But just a few months ago he also let his new F.C.C . chairman suggest an end to net neutrality , and his secretary of education heartily endorse the decision of a Republican judge ending teacher tenure , in which said judge claimed “there are a significant number of grossly ineffective teachers currently active in California classrooms.”Well , which is it ? Are you trying to build the new , white-collar Democratic Party or not , and if so , where do you expect these people to come from ?This sort of confusion about practical politics has long bedeviled New Democrats . And in fairness , we did let the president down , after that cool , cool fall day in 2008 . The sorts of sweeping , groundbreaking reforms we were hoping for — the change we could believe in — has never been accomplished from the top down in America , but has always meant a president gathering up the strands of many useful ideas and experiments , and working with the power , and often the hands , feet , elbows and knees , of grass-roots movements at his back .Franklin D. Roosevelt’s leading advisers , Harry L. Hopkins , Frances Perkins , Harold L. Ickes and Henry A. Wallace , among others , had labored long in the trenches on crucial issues of social welfare , labor rights , and land and farm preservation . The Tennessee Valley Authority came out of a decades-long struggle for public power , by Senator George W. Norris . No one in the Congress or Mr. Obama’s cabinet has provided anything like this sort of counsel , or experience .Nor has there been anything like the sorts of longstanding , populist , militant farm and labor movements that put the New Deal over . In the turmoil of the 1930s , worker uprisings literally took over waterfronts , factories , department stores and even the city of Minneapolis . Occupy Wall Street took over Zuccotti Park , then evaporated . It takes more than that — more than casting a vote every couple of years — to make change .
Now that Obamacare has finished with an amazing surge in signups , apparently passing the 7 million mark for the exchanges , there have been two main responses . Republicans are in full-on denial — the books are cooked ! Nobody has paid ! It’s only because people have been forced to do it ! Benghazi ! Vince Foster ! Meanwhile , progressives are full of caution . It’s just a start , we don’t know how well this will work in the longer run , too soon to celebrate .The right-wing reaction is , of course , ludicrous . But the cautious progressives are being too cautious . This really is what Joe Biden would have called a Big Frothing Deal , or something like that .The key question you need to ask is , what would make Obamacare fail if it did fail ?Contrary to what the right has been saying , there’s nothing at all wrong with the concept of a government guarantee of health insurance — every other advanced country does it , and they all have much cheaper care than we do . The question , instead , was whether the compromises made to get past the political barriers to universal insurance had produced a system too complex to work .I’ve always thought of Obamacare as a sort of Rube Goldberg device that awkwardly simulates the results of a single-payer system . It’s run through private insurance companies in part to buy off the industry , in part to let most people with good insurance keep it . It relies on a mandate plus subsidies , rather than full funding via the tax system , in part to keep down the headline spending number . And so on . The resulting system isn’t what anyone would design from scratch ; it was , however , probably the only kind of system we could get .So , the risk was that it would be too Rube Goldbergy — that it would be too hard to get the system up and running , that people wouldn’t hear about their options or be able to navigate their way through the choices available . And for a while , with the botched website , it looked as if this worst-case scenario was coming true .But now we know : despite the initial botch , despite difficulty getting the word out to Latinos and others , we have a lot of people signing up . And that was the hard part . When the next signup window opens , even more of the bugs will have been worked out , and many people who didn’t sign up for 2014 will be hearing word-of-mouth stories about the benefits .We’ve had proof of concept , and that means we’re over the hump . This was a very big day .
Whenever Barack Obama seems in danger of falling , do we have to hear that George W. Bush made the cliff ?It happened with the economy . For the president’s staunchest defenders , legitimate questions about whether the stimulus was wisely crafted and whether Obamacare was rushed took a back seat to lamentations over the damage that his predecessor had done . Obama wasn’t perfect , but at least he wasn’t Bush .And with the Middle East , those defenders sometimes turn Bush’s epic mistakes into Obama’s hall pass . Perhaps he hasn’t figured out what’s right , but he isn’t guilty of the original wrong , which is constantly being litigated anew , as if a fresh verdict on the events of 2003 could alter the challenges and stakes of 2014 .On Tuesday there was another spasm of this . As Congress debated the escalation of airstrikes against Islamic extremists , Representative Lloyd Doggett , a Texas Democrat , digressed to inveigh against “the wholly unnecessary Bush-Cheney invasion of Iraq , ” a bell that was rung 11 1/2 years ago and can’t be un-rung now .And to judge from my inbox lately and the chatter I overhear , what matters to many of Obama’s most stalwart fans isn’t whether he erred in the way he spoke of those extremists , turned his attention to them quickly enough or is now confronting them with the correct dose of belligerence : not too little , not too much .At least he’s not Bush . He didn’t hallucinate weapons of mass destruction , make a spurious case for war or condone torture . I hear so much about Bush’s failings and Bush’s sins that you’d think he were still huddled over a desk in Washington rather than dabbing at a canvas in Texas .Enough . It’s true that Obama hasn’t replicated Bush’s offenses , and it’s consoling . But it isn’t exactly reason for a parade , and it doesn’t inoculate him . The culpability that lies elsewhere doesn’t relieve the responsibilities that are now his .And not being as bad as someone else is hardly the same as being good . Obama can rise far above Bush and still fall short . The presidency isn’t “The Voice” ( though it is a little like “Survivor” ) . You’re not judged only in relation to the other performers who’ve been on stage . You’re judged by how well you respond to the unique circumstances of your time and place — by your ability to clean up the mess , not whether you made it .This not-as-bad-as defense is a pointless partisan tic . We’ve seen a lot of it over the course of this presidency and will no doubt see a lot of it during the next , be it Democratic or Republican .The I.R.S . scandal was not as bad as Watergate . ( Nothing’s ever as bad as Watergate , which serves a nifty historical function as the gold standard of executive malfeasance and mendacity . )The bungled rollout of Obamacare was not as bad as the botched response to Katrina .It’s apples and hurricanes , but they’re put in the same basket , in a manner that recalls a child trying to evade punishment by ratting out a sibling for something worse . Don’t be mad , Mommy , about Operation Fast and Furious and all those guns that ended up with Mexican drug cartels . Ronnie traded arms for hostages as part of this whole Iran-contra affair !I sometimes like to imagine presidential campaigns waged along these lines and what the candidates’ not-as-bad-as bumper stickers might say .“Fewer Lies Than Nixon.” “Fewer Sweaters Than Carter.” “Fewer Interns Than Clinton.” “Better Speller Than Quayle.”It works in the other direction , too , and Obama has definitely suffered plenty of not-as-good-as slings . Former presidents are held up not merely as yardsticks ; they’re rulers used to rap the knuckles of the Oval Office’s current inhabitant and beat him over the head .Smack : That Teddy Roosevelt certainly understood the power of the bully pulpit ! Thwack : That L.B.J . really knew how to schmooze ! A president is like a second spouse living in the saintly shadow of a first one who perished too soon .George Santayana famously said that those who don’t know history are destined to repeat it . But are those who fixate on it blind to how peculiar the present is , and to the fact that no degree of longing for a lost hero or blaming of a departed villain is going to change what lies ahead ?If we’re determined to glance back at a figure who flatters Obama , let’s really have at it and look all the way to Warren Harding . Golf wasn’t his only distraction . He also had a thing for poker . And when it came to seeming and feeling overwhelmed , the 29th president , an Ohio Republican , reputedly confessed to friends that he was lost in the job .By that measure Obama is a rock . But it doesn’t make him a boulder .
Noah Smith has the definitive piece on what’s wrong , so far , with the new FiveThirtyEight . For all the big talk about data-driven analysis , what it actually delivers is sloppy and casual opining with a bit of data used , as the old saying goes , the way a drunkard uses a lamppost — for support , not illumination . Smith:In sum , this so-called “data-driven” website is significantly less data-driven ( and less sophisticated ) than Business Insider or Bloomberg View or The Atlantic . It consists nearly entirely of hedgehoggy posts supporting simplistic theories with sparse data and zero statistical analysis , making no quantitative predictions whatsoever . It has no relationship whatsoever to the sophisticated analysis of rich data sets for which Nate Silver himself has become famous .The problem with the new FiveThirtyEight is not one of data vs. theory . It is one of “data” the buzzword vs. data the actual thing .So what would real data-driven reporting look like ( beyond what goes on at the sites Noah mentions , and also at the Times ) ? Well , here’s an example : Charles Gaba’s ACASignups.net . Gaba , a website developer , realized that nobody was systematically keeping track of enrollment data for Obamacare , and has turned himself into one-stop shopping on the law’s progress . And he really fills a need : when you read news reports on Obamacare , you can tell right away which reporters have been reading Gaba and know what’s happening and which reporters are relying solely on official announcements — or , worse , dueling political spin .For the record , Gaba’s take on the program so far is fairly optimistic : he projects 6.3 million signups by March 31 , and has very carefully debunked claims that the vast majority of those signing up were previously insured . But the main point is that he’s filling a niche by using a lot more data than the mainstream media . That’s what we thought Nate Silver would be doing , and maybe he eventually will . But for now , Gaba is the model .
Three blog posts and a column should probably suffice to cover the debate over Obamacare and work incentives , but I don’t want to let the topic drop without first stepping back and talking about the actual health policy disagreement here . My column and posts last week criticized what struck me as a kind of insouciance from liberals about this issue , shading into a post-work utopianism that doesn’t wrestle with what , in practice , the decline of work is actually likely to mean for issues of class , mobility , and social equality . But it’s also important to recognize that for many liberal writers , the controlling assumption here is not anti-work or pro-work . It’s just pro-universal health care as a basic standard for a decent society , with the consequences taken as they come .I would prefer that this perspective was accompanied by less chatter about how the only people working less because of Obamacare will be The Most Hardworking Amazing Moms in America , and fewer suggestions that it’s indecent and unpatriotic to worry about how welfare policy influences economic decision-making . But stripped of the Panglossian window dressing , it’s entirely reasonable to believe that some public goods are too important to be withheld just because they might have a few perverse consequences . ( I can certainly think of a few policies I would support even if they took a bite out workforce participation . )At least where the center-left is concerned , then , if you dig deep enough into the work-incentives debate you’ll hit the same old argument about the importance of universal comprehensive insurance . That’s why you keep seeing Obamacare’s defenders argue that the law’s income effect — where people work less because they’re getting insurance benefits at a much-reduced cost — is mostly fine , because we don’t want people having to work to afford a basic good like health insurance . And it’s why , when they talk about the substitution effect — the way the the subsidy phase-out creates an effective marginal tax that discourages working longer hours or taking a higher-paying job — they usually concede the existence of a problem , but then argue that the best way to solve it would be to extend Obamacare’s existing benefit further up the income ladder , or make it universal … in each case , at an expense that conservatives would inevitably oppose .What’s being implicitly ruled out , in both cases , is the possibility that government should be subsidizing insurance , but also subsidizing less of it than Obamacare does , and that the scope of the existing insurance model is making both the income and the substitution effects larger than they need to be . This is basically the theory behind the most plausible conservative alternative — a flat subsidy for catastrophic coverage — to the health care law we actually got . And though liberals mostly reject it , I think it’s a theory worth entertaining even if you believe absolutely in the kind of redistribution inherent in Obamacare … because even granted the pro-redistribution premise it’s still not obvious that subsidizing comprehensive insurance is the best way to go about it .Think about it this way . The welfare state delivers a basket of subsidies to lower-income Americans . Some of these subsidies take the form of cash , and some are direct subsidies for various goods ( food , housing , health insurance ) . Some are tied to work — the earned income tax credit is the notable example — and some of them are not . Pre-Obamacare , the main subsidy for health insurance was tied to work , which both conservatives and liberals tend to regard as a less-than-ideal design ; it was also open-ended and regressive , making it a lousy deal for low-income Americans , period .So we can agree that we should be transitioning away from that model . But there’s no necessary reason why , in the course of that transition , we should just set the new “health care” share of the low-income basket at the levels suggested by the existing insurance model , when that model plainly isn’t delivering value for those dollars overall . Maybe , instead , it would make more sense to take some of the money that Obamacare spends chasing the goal of comprehensive coverage and spend it , say , on giving single workers some of the same E.I.T.C . benefits as families . Or on a larger child tax credit . Or on a straightforward payroll tax cut . Or — to pick a liberal cause , instead of a reform conservative idea — new experiments in universal pre-kindergarten !If severing health insurance from work inevitably reduces workforce participation , that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t gradually sever it , and seek to subsidize insurance in a different way . But it means that we should think seriously about what else we should be doing , and whether we should be spending as much as Obamacare spends on insurance when there are other transfers that might not offer as many work disincentives , might give a stronger boost to upward mobility , and might do more long-term good .On the last point , I don’t want to rehearse the entire debate about catastrophic versus comprehensive coverage , and the good that health insurance does or doesn’t do . I’ll just note two recent items that I think are relevant to this debate . The first is a big Times story , running today:One of the largest and most meticulous studies of mammography ever done , involving 90,000 women and lasting a quarter-century , has added powerful new doubts about the value of the screening test for women of any age .It found that the death rates from breast cancer and from all causes were the same in women who got mammograms and those who did not . And the screening had harms : One in five cancers found with mammography and treated was not a threat to the woman’s health and did not need treatment such as chemotherapy , surgery or radiation .The study , published Tuesday in The British Medical Journal , is one of the few rigorous evaluations of mammograms conducted in the modern era of more effective breast cancer treatments . It randomly assigned Canadian women to have regular mammograms and breast exams by trained nurses or to have breast exams alone .Researchers sought to determine whether there was any advantage to finding breast cancers when they were too small to feel . The answer is no , the researchers report .The second is a study published this month in the Journal of Development Economics . Here’s the executive summary:We examine the impact of removing user fees for healthcare in rural Ghana using data from a randomized experiment that includes rich information on objective measures of child health status . We find that free care increased use of formal healthcare shifting care seeking away from informal providers , with particularly strong effects for children who were anaemic at baseline . There was no health effect on the intervention population taken overall . [ emphasis mine — R.D . ] However , consistent with the utilization findings , there were health improvements amongst those with anaemia initially . Further benefits included a large reduction in health spending , with the effect greater at higher levels of the medical spending distribution . Free care was found to have no influence on a range of malaria prevention behaviours or on the incidence of self-reported illness , suggesting that ex-ante moral hazard is unlikely to be a concern in this particular setting .If you want a reason to doubt the wisdom of redistribution-via-insurance , these are the places to start : In the evidence , widespread and accumulating , that what we spend on medical treatment — and what the government spends for us — does not have a clear connection to how healthy we are and how long we live .This evidence does not make the case for excluding health insurance , and the financial protection it supplies , when you design a safety net . But it does make a case against Obamacare as designed , especially given some of the trade-offs that design requires . And it makes a positive case for deploying resources somewhat differently , focusing more on the nexus of work and money income , and spending less on a benefit that can only be spent in ways that don’t seem to be producing the promised results .
CONVENTIONAL wisdom holds that firearms are the preserve of conservative white men . You would never know this at my local shooting range , which happens to be in a majority African-American area , and has a clientele that reflects that fact . There , as a white man , I’m often in the minority ; just one more guy who likes to fire weapons — another person to chat to and share stories with . It is , I’d venture , how things should be .By rights , the Second Amendment should serve as a totem of African-Americans’ full citizenship and enfranchisement . For centuries , firearms have been indispensable to black liberation : as crucial a defense against tyranny for Frederick Douglass and Martin Luther King Jr. as for Sam Adams and George Washington . Today , however , many black Americans have a decidedly mixed relationship with the right to bear arms .In August , as the outrage over the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson , Mo. , dominated the news , an African-American group calling itself the Huey P. Newton Gun Club took to the streets of Dallas , rifles in hand , to protest . Local businesses were supportive , and the city’s police chief confirmed in a statement that his department “supports the constitutional rights of all.” On Twitter , the hashtag # blackopencarry prompted a warm response from conservatives .And yet , that same month , a 22-year-old black man named John Crawford III was shot dead by the police in an Ohio Walmart after a white customer claimed excitedly that a man was pointing a gun at his fellow patrons . Later , the store’s security footage revealed that Mr. Crawford had been holding a BB gun that he had picked up in the sporting goods department , and that the caller’s testimony had been wrong . Ohio is an open carry state . That didn’t make much difference for Mr. Crawford .Until around 1970 , the aims of America’s firearms restrictionists and the aims of America’s racists were practically inextricable . In both the colonial and immediate post-Revolutionary periods , the first laws regulating gun ownership were aimed squarely at blacks and Native Americans . In both the Massachusetts and Plymouth colonies , it was illegal for the colonists to sell guns to natives , while Virginia and Tennessee banned gun ownership by free blacks .In the antebellum period , the chief justice of the United States , Roger B. Taney , wrote a grave warning into the heart of the execrable Dred Scott decision . If blacks were permitted to become citizens , Taney cautioned , they , like whites , would have full liberty to “keep and carry arms wherever they went.”White Southerners would eventually be forced to accept blacks as their fellow citizens . But old habits died hard . After the Civil War , many Southern states enacted Black Codes to prohibit ownership of guns by blacks . The measures served their purpose . In her remarkable 1892 disquisition on the evils of lynching , the writer Ida B . Wells noted that “the only times an Afro-American who was assaulted got away has been when he had a gun and used it in self-defense.” Wells offered some blunt advice : “a Winchester rifle should have a place of honor in every black home , and it should be used for that protection which the law refuses to give.”At the height of the civil rights movement , black freedom fighters took Wells’s counsel seriously . Although he was denied a concealed-carry permit , the Rev . Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. had what his adviser Glenn E. Smiley described as a veritable “arsenal” at home .Far from being a digression from the principle of nonviolence , this willingness to defend oneself was heir to a long , proud tradition . Considering in 1850 what he believed to be the best response to the Fugitive Slave Act , Frederick Douglass proposed : “a good revolver.”The first major ban on the open carrying of firearms — a Republican-led bill that was drafted after Black Panthers began hanging around the State Legislature in Sacramento with their guns on display — was signed in 1967 by none other than Gov . Ronald Reagan of California . The federal Gun Control Act of 1968 was primarily a reaction to the scourge of “Saturday night specials” — cheap handguns owned by the poor and the black . The National Rifle Association opposed neither law .So the fact that one of the seminal Second Amendment cases in American history is named for a black plaintiff is a beautiful and moving thing indeed . McDonald v. Chicago , argued in 2010 , was brought by Otis McDonald , a 76-year-old black man tired of watching his neighborhood give way to crime and gang warfare . The Supreme Court ruled 5 to 4 that the Second Amendment applied not just to all people , but to the states as well as to the federal government , and that Chicago was therefore not permitted to prohibit Mr. McDonald from keeping a handgun for his defense .Yet African-American activists typically refrain from involvement in the issue of gun rights . In October 2013 , Shaneen Allen , 27 , a black single mother of two , was arrested in New Jersey for carrying a firearm without a license ( she was under the impression that her Pennsylvania concealed-carry permit was accepted across state lines ) , and threatened with a prison sentence of up to 11 years for her mistake .But it was conservative publications , such as my own National Review , and the N.R.A . that came to her defense . The N.A.A.C.P . and the usual champions remained unusually quiet . ( There was no news conference featuring the Rev . Al Sharpton . ) They have been largely absent , too , from the case of Marissa Alexander , a black Florida woman given a 20-year sentence for firing a warning shot near her abusive husband .It’s a problem of perception , an assumption that the Second Amendment is the province of whites , that cuts both ways . In 2009 , as the first Tea Party rallies swept the country , Contessa Brewer of MSNBC showed a video of a man at an anti-Obamacare rally with a pistol on his hip and suggested that “there are questions about whether this has racial overtones ... white people showing up with guns.” Later , it came out that the man in the video was actually black .At least 15 percent of African-Americans report that they own guns — about the same rate as all other “nonwhites.” But as anybody who has attended an N.R.A . convention can attest , there is a gaping hole in the organization’s membership . Look around the convention center and you will see plenty of women , a good number of Asians and Hispanics , and even a smattering of children . Blacks ? Not so much .This is a tremendous shame . It is one thing for the N.R.A . to celebrate black Second Amendment advocates such as its spokesman Colion Noir , and Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. of Milwaukee County , but it is quite another for Wayne LaPierre to inveigh against “home invaders , drug cartels , carjackers , knockout gamers , and rapers , and haters , ” and for the camera to then pan around a sea of white faces clapping in unison .Malcolm X may have a deservedly mixed reputation , but the famous photograph of him standing at the window , rifle in hand , insisting on black liberation “by any means necessary , ” is about as American as it gets . It should be celebrated just like the “Don’t tread on me” Gadsden flag . By not making that connection , the movement is losing touch with one of its greatest triumphs and forsaking a prime illustration of why its cause is so just and so crucial .If supporters of the right to keep and bear arms want their pleas to be heard in their proper context , they might consider talking a little less about Valley Forge and a little more about Jim Crow — and attempting to fill their ranks with people who have known much more recently what tyranny really looks like .
Sorry about blog silence — real life intruded , plus I did have to write a column . But I shouldn’t let the day pass without mentioning the latest big Obamacare news . Final enrollment for 2014 , we now know , will be more than 8 million . The age mix has also improved , with more young people signing up at the end ; as Jonathan Cohn points out in the linked article , the age mix in Obamacare’s first year is now just about identical to the age mix in Romneycare’s first year . Goodbye , death spiral .How did enrollment manage to surge so impressively despite the initial debacle of healthcare.gov ? Obviously they fixed the website ; but the broader issue , as Sarah Kliff rightly points out , is that being uninsured is truly terrible . Uninsured Americans really , really wanted coverage , and they weren’t ready to give up .Kliff doesn’t make this point too explicitly , but this diagnosis has another crucial implication : the benefits of Obamacare , for all its imperfections , are immense . Millions of people who lived extremely anxious lives now have far more security than before . Compared with those benefits , the complaints of some already insured people that they have less choice of doctors than before , or that they’re no longer allowed to retain minimalist plans , look like whining . ( And of course not one of the more serious-sounding stories about soaring premiums and all that has held up under scrutiny . )And speaking of whining , the GOP response seems to be to make every possible insinuation to the effect that the numbers are somehow fraudulent . I actually don’t think there’s a game plan here ; their whole position was premised on the inevitable collapse of health reform , and they have no plan B .All around , as Cohn says , a very good day for reform .
The good news about Obamacare so far shouldn’t be considered disputable . Enrollments really are above target ; multiple independent surveys show a sharp drop in the uninsured population ; health care cost growth really has slowed dramatically , whatever the reason ; the newly insured are generally satisfied with their coverage . If you want to insist that big problems lie ahead , fine ( but please explain ) , but the facts so far are pretty good .But what I’m getting — and what you get whenever you suggest that things are going OK — is an outpouring , not so much of disagreement , as of fury . People get red-in-the-face angry , practically to the point of incoherence , over the suggestion that it’s not a disaster .What’s that about ? Partly it may be Obama derangement syndrome . I was struck by mail I received after my last column accusing me of shilling for Obama and refusing to admit what a disaster he’s been — when the column didn’t so much as mention the guy . Obamacare was a label stuck on the Affordable Care Act by its opponents , to tie the president to the disaster to come ; now they’re livid that it , and he , are turning out OK .Partly it may be general hatred for any kind of program that helps the less fortunate , especially if they happen to be , you know , not white . Such programs must be disasters — don’t bother me with evidence .And partly , I suspect , there’s now an element of shame . If this thing is actually working , everyone who yelled about how it would be a disaster ends up looking fairly stupid .But , you know , sometimes looks don’t deceive .
Over at Talking Points Memo , they seem bemused by the violent reaction on the right to any suggestion that Obamacare is working as well as all the evidence suggests it is . Josh Marshall and Ezra Klein both made a fairly obvious point : Kathleen Sebelius’s resignation was almost surely timed to follow good news , so that her departure wouldn’t be easy to spin as part of a narrative about failed reform . The right , however , went ballistic — not so much expressing skepticism over the good enrollment numbers and the encouraging survey data as expressing total outrage and bewilderment that anyone believes the good news . On the right they know , just know , that it’s a total disaster .What’s interesting about this is that conservative health wonks , however much they may like to spin facts , know better : even on the right , everyone who knows anything about the subject has been telling people not to expect a collapse , a death spiral , whatever , and even suggesting that Republicans may need to accept that much of Obamacare is irreversible . But not many people in that camp read , say , Avik Roy ; they’re getting their information from Fox News and Rush , and they hear nothing but tales of disaster .But why would they place so much faith in these sources ? These are , after all , the same sources that told them that Romney was going to win big , that we were headed for hyperinflation , and much much more . How can such experiences not have instilled at least a bit of doubt ?Well , we basically know the answer . One thing I learned from reporting on the Madoff affair was the term “affinity fraud” : people are easily duped by con men who seem to be like them , to be their kind of people . What Fox , Rush etc . do is build a cultural and emotional bond with their audiences , based mainly on who they dislike and attack . And that bond induces those audiences to believe that what comes from these sources is the obvious truth , never mind what those arrogant elitists with their “facts” and “data” may be saying . ( I’m turning into Stephen Colbert as we speak . )Anyway , it’s quite a sight to behold .
My post yesterday on the new study of post-Romneycare mortality rates in Massachusetts set up a contrast between two policy scenarios : One in which health insurance expansions have a substantial effect on health ( as the Massachusetts mortality data suggests ) , and another in which insurance’s connection to public health is much more limited ( as the data from the Oregon Medicaid experiment had indicated ) .But there’s also a third possibility , which Avik Roy — who knows the Romneycare story as well as anyone on the right — elaborates on here . It may be , he argues , that private insurance does improve outcomes but Medicaid mostly does not , and that the Massachusetts effect is the result of private coverage expanding in that state much faster than in the country as whole . ( There was also a Medicaid expansion under Romneycare , but it accounted for a very modest portion of the newly-insured . )This is a very important issue , obviously — if Roy is right , then even in the light of the Massachusetts data Republican opposition to the Medicaid expansion isn’t as “deadly” as its liberal critics insist — and it will be interesting to see if we end up with Obamacare-era studies that successfully address it . In terms of policy implications , better outcomes for private insurance would tend to make the case for a reform of Obamacare that privatizes low-income coverage and moves Medicaid beneficiaries onto the exchanges ( as Roy and other conservatives have proposed ) , and against the kind of “Medicaid-for-most” scenario that lies at the end of at least one left-of-center policy path .On the other hand , even if Roy is correct it wouldn’t settle the crucial question of how much private coverage people need to purchase to see significant health gains . If most of the mortality improvements were associated with expensive comprehensive coverage , then migrating people from Medicaid to private insurance would only get you better outcomes at a much steeper fiscal price , which neither party ( and yes , especially the G.O.P . ) is particularly eager to pay .Anyway , we’ll see what the future holds , and what the next big study says . ( And so we beat on , boats against the current , borne back ceaselessly into the health care debate … )
Gail Collins : David , it’s less than five weeks until Election Day . And people are so — um — how would you characterize the mood ?David Brooks : Let’s see . Giddy with disinterest . Tingling with unconscious ennui . Quivering with apathy . I’d say the public mood is paradoxical .Gail : Yet control of the Senate hangs in the balance ! And it’s all up to the voters in five to 10 states , which neither you nor I inhabit .David : I’m really glad to have been spared the agony of swing state envy . I’ve never lived in any state that isn’t solidly blue . So I’ve never known what it feels like to live in a place that has the excitement of competitive races . Hence I don’t feel the lack when that excitement goes away . You , coming from Ohio , are not so fortunate . Do you feel pain , perhaps in your wrists and other joints , watching faraway states get all the attention now that you live in a state of political indifference ? Swing state envy is like a concussion , not to be underestimated . I think I may start wearing a purple wrist-band as a sympathy statement .Gail : Our big New York news was that Gov . Andrew Cuomo , who’s up for re-election , found it necessary to go to Afghanistan this week . He sort of spun it as an effort to learn more about homeland security . But I honestly think you can do that in the homeland .David : I’m presuming this was not a hiking the Appalachian Trail sort of thing . Maybe he went to curry favor with the Pashtun population in Rye . Or for the golfing .Gail : Meanwhile his opponent , whose name recognition is limited to his immediate family , reprised that old Lyndon Johnson “Daisy” ad where the little girl is picking petals off a flower and then suddenly – countdown to Armageddon ! In this version , when the nuclear bomb goes off , Andrew Cuomo’s face comes out of the cloud .Did not expect an ad about atomic warfare in the New York gubernatorial race . Possible high point of the political week for me . How about you ? I know you’ve been taking the occasional gander at the big Senate races . What strikes you as interesting ?David : First the money . There’s been a ton of it , more than $ 228 million by outside groups alone so far . But the surprise in this post-Citizens-United era is that the Democrats are winning the money race so easily . I knew that the Democrats were the party of the rich plutocrats , but I didn’t realize how big the lead was . In North Carolina , pro-Democratic groups have a spending lead , $ 13 million to $ 8 million . In Iowa , the Democrats lead $ 9 million to $ 6 million . In Colorado , Democrats lead $ 10 million to $ 5 million . And so on in most states . If this continues Democrats are going to start loving that decision .Gail : I hope it keeps going like this . I’d love to watch Mitch McConnell and John Boehner demand that we do something about the poison of “super PACs.”Meanwhile , on the issues front , I’ve been fascinated by how much Republicans have come to love contraception . Really , if they get any more enthusiastic they’re going to start passing out condoms at the debates .David : Or wearing them on their heads like Howie Mandel .Gail : I’ve heard several Republican Senate candidates announce that they wanted to see birth control pills sold over the counter . This usually starts with a question about Obamacare – and the requirement that employers cover contraceptives in their health insurance plans . Then the Republican says that if birth control pills were sold like aspirin or Tums , they’d be much cheaper . Which may be true , although having them paid for by your insurance is certainly a better deal .David : That’s clearly true . I’m struck , though , by how much the Democrats’ war-on-women charge against the G.O.P . doesn’t seem to be working . In the last Times poll , women were split down the middle , supporting Republicans almost as much as Democrats , 42-43 .Gail : They were still more Democratic-leaning than men . And I do think it’s working in some races , particularly the ones where the Republican candidate supported the personhood amendment . You know , the one that declares all fertilized eggs have the full rights of a human being .That came up in the Iowa Senate debate , which I am slightly embarrassed to admit I watched from beginning to end .David : Wow . You do have swing state envy . Are you listening to reports on corn prices too ?Gail : Iowa debates are always worthwhile . I enjoy the moment when the fiscal conservative calls for less federal spending , and then is forced to make it clear that underwriting the manufacture of corn-based ethanol does not count as wasteful .David : My problem with the ethanol subsidies is purely selfish . You used to be able to drive around Iowa and see some crop diversity . Now it’s corn , corn , corn . I bet that even the field of dreams is covered with corn . It’s tedious .Gail : There’s been a growing attempt on the part of Republicans to bring ISIS into the campaign . Most of the ads I’ve seen don’t have a coherent theme . It’s like , “When terrorists were beheading Americans in Syria , Senator X supported the Obama administration and also missed a public hearing of the Veterans Affairs Committee.”David : I’m just glad to see any foreign policy in this election . We should have at least some form of national debate on ISIS . I guess this is also a Republican effort to nationalize the election . As observers like Sean Trende have noted , earlier in the campaign there was a disjunction between the fundamentals and the polls . The fundamentals — the president’s low approval ratings — suggest this should be a big Republican year . But the polls were much closer . Many Democratic candidates were hanging in there , even in states Romney carried . Over the past month the polls have moved slightly toward the fundamentals — that is in a slightly Republican direction .Gail : People are so angry at Barack Obama . Their ire seems to be mainly about the economy , yet compared to many other countries , the United States is doing pretty well economically . I’m happy to accept the theory that people are angry because of income inequality and the struggling middle class . But the solution to that wouldn’t be electing a Congress that’s determined to cut federal spending . You’d just wind up with more laid-off state employees , highway construction workers , even schoolteachers .Want to explain that to me ?David : It’s possible that people don’t think they’re getting their money’s worth . It could be they’re not crazy about boondoggles like ethanol or gubernatorial trips to Afghanistan . It’s possible that they think they could spend money more wisely than Congress does . Can’t imagine how they could leap to that conclusion .Gail : Well , that’s Congress . But they’re trying to make it all about the president . I’m expecting that Georgia voters will soon be seeing ads in which Michelle Nunn’s picture morphs into Barack Obama .David : What strikes me about this is that the movement is similar across many races , suggesting that there is a national dynamic in place . That makes sense . Over the past five midterms we’ve pretty much seen national dynamics in place most of the time . There was a wave for one party or another . This year that should favor Republicans , who are trying to build the election around national issues , not local candidates .Gail : Do you think these elections matter ? There’s a lot of sentiment that they don’t – that if the Republicans take over the Senate , there’ll be the same stalemate we’ve got now . That it might even make it easier for the Democrats in 2016 , because there’ll still be gridlock and the Republicans will be more clearly to blame .David : I’m simple-minded . I think winning is better than losing . Remember , once an incumbent gets in , he or she is likely to stay there for a long time . I don’t think Democrats should be pre-rationalizing this year’s results .Gail : Me neither . Although it would be pretty interesting if the Republicans won control of the Senate , and we got to spend two years watching them complain about the evils of the filibuster .David : I can’t imagine much legislation will be passed either way . After Obamacare , which was signed into law in March of 2010 , I can’t think of a major piece of legislation that has passed in any of the last four years , and I suppose we’ll go another two in the same stagnation .Gail : You must be forgetting the Responsible Helium Administration and Stewardship Act .But about these elections – I admit that I am jealous of the big swing states . If I was in Iowa or Alaska or North Carolina , I’d be obsessed with the senate race . I’d talk about it all the time , and people would run away when they saw me coming .David : You’ve got it bad .Gail : Here in New York , everything’s pretty much preordained . Except in Staten Island , where the Republican congressman who threatened to throw a TV reporter over a Capitol balcony might be in trouble .David : Is that because TV reporters are so light ? Throwing a print reporter would be way more impressive .Gail : Well , he failed to follow through . Maybe his constituents are irked that he was all show and no throw . But he’s also under multiple indictments for perjury and tax evasion . And yet his defeat is not a foregone conclusion .David : I’d think a perjury record would be a plus . Practice makes perfect .
Jonathan Cohn looks at the evidence so far on health insurance premiums , and finds things not too bad:Coverage will get more expensive for the majority of consumers , as it almost always does . Changes in premiums will vary enormously , from state to state and from plan to plan . But , overall , the 2015 premiums increases will not be significantly worse than they were in the past . They might even be a little better .Charles Gaba finds much the same . Furthermore , there’s a clear trend within the trend : states that did their best to make Obamacare work are also delivering good deals to their residents . California is heading for an increase of only 4.2 percent . On the other hand , things are not looking too good in Florida:In Florida , by contrast , the Republicans in charge did very little to promote the law and , at times , seemed determined to undermine it . Never was this more clear than in 2013 , when the legislature passed and Governor Rick Scott signed a bill that suspended state government’s ability to reject excessive premium increases .Overall , yet more evidence that this reform works wherever politicians let it work .
Three somehow related stories of the day:1 . Brent Bozell’s Media Research Center is an important part of the machinery that has , for the most part , successfully intimidated the news media into adopting a right-wing slant . ( I’ve faced mass mailings , concerted attacks on my university email , and so on . ) But Jim Romenesko finds something interesting : Bozell doesn’t write his own columns or books , forcing a staffer to do it .2 . The Koch brothers have been running ads in Louisiana with distressed citizens facing ruination from Obamacare . But the people in the ads are all paid actors .3 . Best of all is the news from The Can Kicks Back , which is a Bowles-Simpson-run outfit that was supposed to be the youth arm of Fix the Debt . It has always been an astroturf operation , and a clumsy one at that , doing things like hiring dancers to stage fake flash mobs and placing identical ghostwritten articles in college newspapers . Now , The Can Kicks Back’s campaign against debt is running into trouble , because it’s , um , running out of money .What these stories have in common is that they show how much of what passes for genuine expression of public concern is really just a bought and paid-for ( or , in the case of The Can , not sufficiently paid-for ) front for plutocratic priorities .
The Commonwealth Fund is out with a new report comparing advanced-country health care systems , and the ( mostly pre-Obamacare ) US system looks very bad indeed : vastly higher spending per capita than anyone else , with worse results .Of course , this is nothing new . And as always pointing out the obvious brings out claims that the US system is somehow superior despite its lousy outcomes . Aaron Carroll helpfully reminds us that all of the arguments surfacing here are zombies – arguments that should have died in the face of clear evidence that they’re wrong , but keep on shambling along nonetheless . ( I actually learned the term “zombie idea” from the health care discussion , specifically the unending attempts to trash the Canadian system . )I think it’s important , however , to be explicit about something Carroll obviously knows but doesn’t emphasize : the reason for the prevalence of zombies in this field . Some of it is chauvinism . But the main reason for the zombies is unwillingness to accept facts that conflict with ideology . The American health care system is by far the most privatized , most market-oriented system in the advanced world ; it’s also far and away the most expensive , without any sign of getting anything for all that money .If you are committed to the view that the magic of the market solves all problems , this is disturbing – so it must not be true . Bring on the zombies !
One of the truly amazing ( and disheartening ) things about the Great Recession and its aftermath has been the continuing insistence of many economists that it’s somehow a supply-side slump , driven by the evils of Obamacare or something . This tends to come from people who view stagflation in the 1970s as having permanently refuted all things Keynes .So I guess it’s worth pointing out repeatedly that the recent slump shows all the hallmarks of a demand-side shock ; in particular , rising unemployment has been associated with falling inflation — the opposite of stagflation . Here’s an international comparison I happen to have produced for other purposes , comparing the change in unemployment from 2007 to 2013 with the change in inflation over the same period:An interesting point : if you fit a linear equation to these points , the slope of the implied Phillips curve is -0.16 — which is the same number the influential recent paper by Kiley ( pdf ) finds using combined time series and cross-section on US metropolitan areas . Just a coincidence , probably , but I had expected the international relationship to look weaker .
The Iowa Senate candidate who charmed the Internet recently with her hog-castration ad—a disturbing metaphor for her claim that she would “cut pork” in Washington—has joined the distinguished club of political aspirants who shoot things they don’t like , on camera .Here’s Joni Ernst at a firing range , taking “aim at wasteful spending” and setting her “sights on Obamacare.”Before Ms. Ernst brought a gun to a political fight , Ron Gould , an Arizona State Senator who ran for Congress in 2012—but didn’t get past the Republican primaries—blew away a copy of the Affordable Care Act .Before that , a man and a young girl in a Herman Cain ad hurled a rabbit out of a catapult and shot it . The rabbit represented the tax code .And before that , Joe Manchin , now the junior senator from West Virginia , killed a cap-and-trade bill .Mr. Manchin won his race . Mr. Cain and Mr. Gould lost theirs . If Ms. Ernst succeeds , she’ll even out the odds for armed politicians in years to come .
Noah Smith writes that one should not be rude about people you disagree with , because they might turn out to be right . Indeed ; what possible purpose can be served by , say , referring to Austrian economics as a brain worm ? Oh , wait .Actually , I think that Noah was doing the right thing when he brought in the brain worms , and is off on the wrong track on the civility thing . So let me make the case for brain worms .First , picturesque language , used right , serves an important purpose . “Words ought to be a little wild , ” wrote John Maynard Keynes , “for they are the assaults of thoughts on the unthinking.” You could say , “I’m dubious about the case for expansionary austerity , which rests on questionable empirical evidence and zzzzzzzz…” ; or you could accuse austerians of believing in the Confidence Fairy . Which do you think is more effective at challenging a really bad economic doctrine ?Beyond that , civility is a gesture of respect — and sure enough , the loudest demands for civility come from those who have done nothing to earn that respect . Noah felt ( and was ) justified in ridiculing the Austrians because they don’t argue in good faith ; faced with a devastating failure of their prediction about inflation , they didn’t concede that they were wrong and try to explain why . Instead , they denied reality or tried to redefine the meaning of inflation .And if you look at the uncivil remarks by people like , well , me , you’ll find that they are similarly aimed at people arguing in bad faith . I talk now and then about zombie and cockroach ideas . Zombies are ideas that should have been killed by evidence , but keep shambling along — e.g . the claim that all of Europe’s troubled debtors were fiscally irresponsible before the crisis ; cockroaches are ideas that you thought we’d gotten rid of , but keep on coming back , like the claim that Keynes would never have called for fiscal stimulus in the face of current debt levels ( Britain in the 1930s had much higher debt to GDP than it does now ) . Well , what I’m doing is going after bad-faith economics — economics that keeps trotting out claims that have already been discredited .Nor are zombies and cockroaches the only kinds of bad faith ; the worst , as far as I’m concerned , involves refusing to take responsibility for your actual statements . “The failure of high inflation to materialize doesn’t mean that I was wrong , because I only said that there was a risk of inflation” . “When I said that Obamacare spending adds a trillion dollars to the deficit , I wasn’t misleading readers , because I didn’t actually deny that the ACA as a whole reduces the deficit.” And of course , people who engage in that kind of bad faith screech loudly about civility when they’re caught at it .When there’s an honest , good-faith economic debate — say , the ongoing controversy about the effects of quantitative easing — by all means let’s be civil . But in my experience demands for civility almost always come from people who have forfeited the right to the respect they demand .
Ezra Klein’s new venture Vox is up , and so far , so OK — some fairly interesting pieces , and nothing like Nate Silver’s lamentable decision to make a professional concern troll his chief writer on climate . I am troubled by Ezra’s big inauguratory think piece , but that’s because I think the piece raises a genuine intellectual puzzle .What Ezra does is cite research showing that people understand the world in ways that suit their tribal identities : in controlled experiments both conservatives and liberals systematically misread facts in a way that confirms their biases . And more information doesn’t help : people screen out or discount facts that don’t fit their worldview . Politics , as he says , makes us stupid .But here’s the thing : the lived experience is that this effect is not , in fact , symmetric between liberals and conservatives . Yes , liberals are sometimes subject to bouts of wishful thinking . But can anyone point to a liberal equivalent of conservative denial of climate change , or the “unskewing” mania late in the 2012 campaign , or the frantic efforts to deny that Obamacare is in fact covering a lot of previously uninsured Americans ? I don’t mean liberals taking positions you personally disagree with — I mean examples of overwhelming rejection of something that shouldn’t even be in dispute .Or look at how liberals reacted to the woes of healthcare.gov . We heard a lot of talk about how it was Obama’s Katrina , or his Iraq . But was there anything like Bush’s “heckuva job” moment — which was matched by widespread insistence on the right that he was actually doing a great job ? Was there anything like the years-long denial that anything was going wrong with the Iraq occupation ? On the contrary , liberals were quick to acknowledge that the rollout was a disaster , and in fact sort of freaked out — which , as Noam Scheiber says , is what they usually do in the face of setbacks . And what’s more , as Scheiber says , that’s a good thing : faced with setbacks , liberals rush to fix things , rather than denying the problem . Hence the stunning Obamacare comeback .At this point I could castigate Ezra for his both-sides-do-it article — but instead , let me pose this as a question : why are the two sides so asymmetric ? People want to believe what suits their preconceptions , so why the big difference between left and right on the extent to which this desire trumps facts ?One possible answer would be that liberals and conservatives are very different kinds of people — that liberalism goes along with a skeptical , doubting — even self-doubting — frame of mind ; “a liberal is someone who won’t take his own side in an argument.”Another possible answer is that it’s institutional , that liberals don’t have the same kind of monolithic , oligarch-financed network of media organizations and think tanks as the right .Whatever it is , I think it’s important : people are people , but politics doesn’t seem to have the same stupiditizing effect on left and right .
“The facts have a well-known liberal bias , ” declared Rob Corddry way back in 2004 — and experience keeps vindicating his joke . But why ?Not long ago Ezra Klein cited research showing that both liberals and conservatives are subject to strong tribal bias — presented with evidence , they see what they want to see . I then wrote that this poses a puzzle , because in practice liberals don’t engage in the kind of mass rejections of evidence that conservatives do . The inevitable response was a torrent of angry responses and claims that liberals do too reject facts — but none of the claims measured up .Just to be clear : Yes , you can find examples where *some* liberals got off on a hobbyhorse of one kind or another , or where the liberal conventional wisdom turned out wrong . But you don’t see the kind of lockstep rejection of evidence that we see over and over again on the right . Where is the liberal equivalent of the near-uniform conservative rejection of climate science , or the refusal to admit that Obamacare is in fact reaching a lot of previously uninsured Americans ?What I tried to suggest , but maybe didn’t say clearly , is that the most likely answer lies not so much in the character of individual liberals versus that of individual conservatives , as in the difference between the two sides’ goals and institutions . And Jonathan Chait’s recent thoughts on the inherently partisan nature of “data-based” journalism are , I think , helpful in bringing this better into focus .As Chait says , the big Obamacare comeback and the reaction of the right are a very good illustration of the forces at work .The basic facts here are that after a very slow start due to the healthcare.gov debacle , almost everything has gone right for reform . A huge surge of enrollments more than made up the initially lost ground ; the age mix of enrollees has improved ; multiple independent surveys have found a substantial drop in the number of Americans without health insurance .Opponents of Obamacare could respond to these facts by arguing that the whole thing is nonetheless a bad idea , or they could accept that the rollout has gone OK but call for major changes in the program looking forward . What they’re actually engaged in , however , is mass denial and conspiracy theorizing strongly reminiscent of their reaction to polls showing Mitt Romney on the way to defeat , or for that matter evidence of climate change . Acceptance of the facts is , well , unacceptable .Nothing illustrated this better than the reaction to Ezra Klein’s own note about the resignation of Kathleen Sebelius , which was intended as analysis rather than advocacy ; Klein simply made the fairly obvious point that the HHS secretary was in effect free to resign now because Obamacare has been turned around and is going well . But Klein’s statement was met with a mix of outrage and ridicule on the right ; how dare he suggest that the program was succeeding ?Why is it , then , that the right treats statements of fact as proof of liberal bias ?Chait’s answer , which I agree is part of the story , is that the liberal and conservative movements are not at all symmetric in their goals . Conservatives want smaller government as an end in itself ; liberals don’t seek bigger government per se — they want government to achieve certain things , which is quite different . You’ll never see liberals boasting about raising the share of government spending in GDP the way conservatives talk proudly about bringing that share down . Because liberals want government to accomplish something , they want to know whether government programs are actually working ; because conservatives don’t want the government doing anything except defense and law enforcement , they aren’t really interested in evidence about success or failure . True , they may seize on alleged evidence of failure to reinforce their case , but it’s about political strategy , not genuine interest in the facts .One side consequence of this great divide , by the way , is the way conservatives project their own style onto their opponents — insisting that climate researchers are just trying to rationalize government intervention , that liberals like trains because they destroy individualism .But this can’t be the whole story . It doesn’t explain , for example , the rejection of polls in 2012 , or the refusal of the right to admit that things weren’t going well in Iraq — both cases in which conservatives really did have an interest in the outcomes . So what else differentiates the two sides ?Well , surely another factor is the lack of a comprehensive liberal media environment comparable to the closed conservative universe . If you lean right , you can swaddle yourself 24/7 in Fox News and talk radio , never hearing anything that disturbs your preconceptions . ( If you were getting your “news” from Fox , you were told that the hugely encouraging Rand survey was nothing but bad news for Obamacare . ) If you lean left , you might watch MSNBC , but the allegedly liberal network at least tries to make a distinction between news and opinion — and if you watch in the morning , what you get is right-wing conspiracy theorizing more or less indistinguishable from Fox .Yet another factor may be the different incentives of opinion leaders , which in turn go back to the huge difference in resources . Strange to say , there are more conservative than liberal billionaires , and it shows in think-tank funding . As a result , I like to say that there are three kinds of economists : Liberal professional economists , conservative professional economists , and professional conservative economists . The other box isn’t entirely empty , but there just isn’t enough money on the left to close the hack gap .Finally , I do believe that there is a difference in temperament between the sides . I know that it doesn’t show up in the experiments done so far , which show liberals and conservatives more or less equally inclined to misread facts in a tribal way . But such experiments may not be enough like real life to capture the true differences — although I’d be the first to admit that I don’t have solid evidence for that claim . I am , after all , a liberal .
“They call me a long shot , ” Estakio Beltran , a congressional candidate in Washington state , declares in a TV ad , never once disclosing that he’s a Democrat but taking aim with his shotgun at a piñata — an elephant piñata in case anyone doubts what he’s gunning for . Bam ! the gun goes off and the sad-eyed , paper-tattered toy elephant topples . Mr. Beltran’s ad is one of many bamming and kerpowing across the land from candidates pandering to gun enthusiasts . He may not win an election , but his seems the most entertaining or at least the silliest . Particularly so when he racks the empty shell from his gun in macho triumph and rides off like Clint Eastwood , heading east toward the Capitol on a loping donkey ( a Democratic donkey ? ) .Gun ads come and go as political staccato punctuating the electioneering season . They play out as an entirely separate reality from such familiar Americana as the accidental Uzi death last week at the hands of a nine-year-old in Arizona . The latest ads were collected by National Public Radio and , unsurprisingly , shooting a thick wad of “Obamacare” legislation is the cliché of choice among Republicans bearing arms . Will Brooke , a Republican congressional candidate in Alabama , has “a little fun , ” showing off his considerable arsenal of favored weapons — everything from gleaming pistol to ominous assault rifle — and shooting them all at what the Supreme Court has pronounced the law of the land . Joni Ernst , a leather-clad Republican running for Senate from Iowa , dismounts her motorcycle and gets off six rounds and a promise to “unload” on the Affordable Care Act . “Give me a shot ! ” she implores voters in her sign-off .So it goes , to the point where Republicans choosing other sorts of targets provide merciful relief . Matt Rosendale , a Montana candidate for the House , blasts up and away at what he would have you believe is a federal drone snooping on his sacred freedoms . Dan Sullivan , an Alaska Republican running for the Senate , drills a defenseless old TV set , standing his ground against out-of-staters flooding the airwaves with mudslinging campaign ads .So far , no one is making a commercial about the new Idaho law that allows teachers and students to bring guns to class . A professor exercising his “enhanced concealed carry” rights at the state university in Pocatello accidentally shot himself in the foot Wednesday .But in truth , there are moments of substance in the politics of the gun . The ballot in Washington state has competing gun initiatives this fall , with rival check writers going at it to finance TV commercials . Initiative 594 aims to close the notorious loophole that lets people buy guns without background checks online and at gun shows . Backing it are such major donors as Bill and Melinda Gates and Nick Hanauer , the Seattle venture capitalist . In contrast , initiative 591 would prevent the expansion of background checks . The gun lobby stands behind this as the ballot duel plays out .
WOODSTOCK , Ga. â THEREâS a political axiom that says if nobody is upset with what youâre doing , youâre not doing your job . Weâve seen this proved time and again in the liberal attacks on conservatives like Sarah Palin and Dr. Benjamin Carson , who provide principled examples to women and minorities and are savaged by the left for doing that job so well .But cheap-shot politics isnât relegated to Democrats . Last week the House speaker , John A. Boehner of Ohio , attacked conservative groups who criticized the budget deal , hashed out by Representative Paul D. Ryan , Republican of Wisconsin , and Senator Patty Murray , Democrat of Washington , for failing to reduce spending and for raising taxes .âTheyâre using our members and theyâre using the American people for their own goals , â he said , calling the opposition âridiculous.âIn one way , Mr. Boehner is correct . The goals of groups like ours are those that congressional Republicans once espoused : smaller government , less spending and lower taxes . Alas , those who demand such things today from their elected officials face unfounded attacks .Make no mistake : The deal is a betrayal of the conservatives who fueled the Republicansâ 2010 midterm shellacking of Democrats .It raises discretionary spending above $ 1 trillion for 2014 and 2015 . It reneges on $ 63 billion of sequester cuts . Its $ 28 billion in deficit reduction over the next decade is a pittance compared with the $ 680 billion deficit piled up in 2013 alone . And it raises taxes , particularly on airplane passengers through new travel fees .Perhaps most troubling is that the deal locks in spending for President Obamaâs Affordable Care Act , ensuring that the worst parts of Obamacare will continue unfolding to the shock of increasing numbers of Americans .But the budget plan is about more than taxes and spending . It was a slick means by which Senate Republicans could appear to oppose the deal while in fact allowing it to sail through the chamber .Take Senator Mitch McConnell , Republican of Kentucky , the minority leader , who opposed efforts to defund Obamacare earlier this year while claiming to do everything possible to stop it .After attacking conservative groups for their efforts to prevent the funding of Obamacare , Mr. McConnell , who is facing a primary challenge in his 2014 re-election race , is now seeking to portray himself as a conservative darling , championing fiscal austerity by voicing opposition to the budget proposal . ( My organization has not endorsed a candidate in that race . ) Doing so gives him some nifty talking points that align with most conservative groups , but it is little more than parliamentary sleight of hand .Consider how he handled the vote on the bill . To defeat a filibuster , its supporters needed 60 senators to win cloture and move to a final vote . Instead of rallying his troops against the vote , Mr. McConnell allowed a handful of Republicans in battleground states â who needed to be seen as supporting the bill â to vote for cloture , while he and the rest railed against it , casting themselves in the role of budget hawks .With cloture accomplished , a dozen Republicans were then free to vote against final passage if they need wiggle room when theyâre confronted on the campaign trail next fall by voters demanding action on government spending . Mr. McConnell and many Senate Republicans used the vote to manipulate the system , allowing them to cast themselves as deal makers or principled conservatives , depending on their audience .This is not principled policy making ; what weâre seeing is simple gamesmanship that raises legitimate questions about which values Republicans truly hold and which are merely interchangeable with those of Democrats .The job of Tea Party groups and other conservatives is pretty simple : to inform Americans about the need for restraint in spending , tax relief , pro-growth economic policies and individual liberty â and to support the men and women who pledge to promote these positions . To the extent that the speaker of the House and Senate Republicans are attacking such groups , it looks as if weâre doing our job .But after this budget vote , our job expands to include informing Americans about who keeps their word in Congress and who does not .When establishment Republicans call spending increases spending cuts , deny that raising taxes is a hike , and champion deficit reduction that doesnât scratch the surface of our nationâs debt , it suggests a detachment from the facts . But when those who voted for them criticize their elected officials for not keeping their promises , and are then attacked for doing so , it suggests that Kurt Vonnegut was right in observing , âA sane person to an insane society must appear insane.â
IN just over a decade the United States will need 130,000 more doctors than medical schools are producing . So says the Association of American Medical Colleges , which warns of a doctor shortage that will drive up wait times , shorten office visits and make it harder for Americans to access the care they need .The road to Obamacare has seen its share of speed bumps , as well as big potholes . But a physician shortage is unlikely to be one of its roadblocks .Shortage forecasters point to two major factors . One is an aging population . The proportion of Americans who are 65 and older will increase to 19 percent in 2030 from 12.9 percent today , according to federal projections . Second , Obamacare will insure 30 million more Americans by the end of the decade , dramatically increasing demand for physicians . Extrapolating forward from todayâs 2.4 physicians per 1,000 Americans would mean we will need at least 90,000 more physicians by 2020 , or so the reasoning goes .Regardless of your political views , there are good reasons to be skeptical of these predictions . Take Massachusetts , where Obamacare-style reforms were implemented beginning in 2006 , adding nearly 400,000 people to the insurance rolls . Appointment wait times for family physicians , internists , pediatricians , obstetricians and gynecologists , and even specialists like cardiologists , have bounced around since but have not appreciably increased overall , according to a Massachusetts Medical Society survey . Massachusettsâs experience may differ from other areas , particularly rural regions , but the results of reform there suggest shortage fears are exaggerated .The population is indeed aging fast , but the methods of treating illness in old age are also changing quickly . Today , more patients can be cared for in subacute settings rather than in hospitals . And new technologies are turning the treatment of many medical conditions into less resource-intensive endeavors , requiring fewer doctors to manage each episode of illness .Innovations , such as sensors that enable remote monitoring of disease and more timely interventions , can help pre-empt the need for inpatient treatment . Drugs and devices can also obviate the need for more costly treatments . Minimally invasive procedures , like laparoscopic surgeries , can be done more quickly with faster recovery times and fewer physicians . An average patient stay in the hospital is about two days or less following a stent but about seven days following a coronary bypass operation . Research on radiation treatments for breast cancer suggests that 15 treatments can be just as effective as the traditional 30 treatments . Likewise , one larger dose of radiation can be as good at relieving pain from bone metastases as five to 10 separate , smaller treatments . Thereâs every reason to expect the pace of these timesaving medical innovations to continue .Other medical personnel can also expand the reach of physicians to care for a larger population . Nurse practitioners , health aides , pharmacists , dietitians , psychologists and others already care for patients in numerous ways , and their roles should expand in the future . The rise of nonphysician providers will enable more team care . Skilled health aides will monitor patients at home and alert a doctor if certain medical parameters decline . Nurses will provide wound care to diabetic patients , adjust medications like blood thinners and provide the initial management of chemotherapy side effects for cancer patients . Pharmacists will provide more counseling and urgent care . Physicians will remain essential to the proper diagnosis and treatment of disease , but will be backed up by teams who will help manage the more routine features of chronic illness .The opportunity exists to deliver more services and care with fewer physicians , but itâs not a foregone conclusion . Policy changes will be necessary to reach the full potential of team care .That means expanding the scope of practice laws for nurse practitioners and pharmacists to allow them to provide comprehensive primary care ; changing laws inhibiting telemedicine across state lines ; and reforming medical malpractice laws that force providers to stick with inefficient practices simply to reduce liability risk . New payment models must reward investments in technologies that can save money in the long run . Most important , we need to change medical school curriculum to provide training in team care to take full advantage of the capabilities of nonphysicians in caring for patients .Instead of building more medical schools and expanding our doctor pool , we should focus on increasing the productivity of existing physicians and other health care workers while incorporating new technologies and practices that make care more efficient . With doctors , as with drugs or surgery , more is not always better .
Like so many other parts of health care , childbirth has become a more medically intense experience over the last two decades . The use of drugs to induce labor has become far more common , as have cesarean sections . Today , about half of all births in this country are hastened either by drugs or surgery , double the share in 1990 .Crucial to the change has been a widely held belief that once fetuses pass a certain set of thresholds — often 39 weeks of gestation and five and a half pounds in weight — they’re as healthy as they can get . More time in the womb doesn’t do them much good , according to this thinking . For parents and doctors , meanwhile , scheduling a birth , rather than waiting for its random arrival , is clearly more convenient .But a huge new set of data , based on every child born in Florida over an 11-year span , is calling into question some of the most basic assumptions of our medicalized approach to childbirth . The results also play into a larger issue : the growing sense among many doctors and other experts that Americans would actually be healthier if our health care system were sometimes less aggressive .The new data suggest that the thresholds to maximize a child’s health seem to be higher , which means that many fetuses might benefit by staying longer in the womb , where they typically add at least a quarter-pound per week . Seven-pound babies appear to be healthier than six-pound babies — and to fare better in school as they age . The same goes for eight-pound babies compared with seven-pound babies , and nine-pound babies compared with eight-pound babies . Weight , of course , may partly be an indicator of broader fetal health , but it seems to be a meaningful one : The chunkier the baby , the better it does on average , all the way up to almost 10 pounds .“Birth weight matters , and it matters for everyone , ” says David N. Figlio , a Northwestern University professor and co-author of the study , which will soon be published in the American Economic Review , one of the field’s top journals .Mr. Figlio — 5 pounds , 15 ounces at birth — is quick to add that birth weight is not destiny . Its effects are considerably smaller than those of social class , for example . A lighter baby of well-educated parents is likely to do much better in life than a heavier baby of high-school dropouts .Yet within every group the researchers studied , birth weight appeared to have a noticeable effect , even after controlling for a long list of other factors . Mr. Figlio estimates that , all else equal , a 10-pound baby will score an average of 80 points higher on the 1,600-point SAT than a six-pound baby . Another way to see the pattern is to look only at top-scoring students : Among the top 5 percent of test scorers in elementary school , one in three weighed at least eight pounds at birth , compared with only one in four of all babies .The Florida study will not be the last word on birth weight and timing . As the authors acknowledge , they can not rule out the possibility that weight is a proxy for other aspects of fetal health that more time in the womb would not improve . And late and heavy babies also bring some risks . Still , the results are sufficiently striking — across a very large population , and present in every subgroup — that they’re likely to influence the debate about the medicalization of birth .In 2011 , the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and other groups began pushing to eliminate induced labor before the 39th week of pregnancy absent a clear medical reason . The induction rate has since fallen . If further research confirms the Florida findings , it will be easy to see an argument for further declines , as well as for a serious look at whether the induction rate is also too high in the 40th week . Many inductions today are elective , rather than coming after a woman’s water has broken or after a medical problem .The notion that fetuses may benefit from being in the womb beyond the 39th week , says Dr. Brent C. James , who runs the Institute for Health Care Delivery Research in Salt Lake City , “makes perfect clinical sense.” As in much of biology , he added , “You don’t have a hard cutoff , a cliff edge.”These issues are part of a debate that extends well beyond childbirth . The notion that Mother Nature should more often trump Pitocin and other induction drugs fits with a broad questioning of the American health care system , famously the world’s most intensive and expensive . Starting about a decade ago , an inchoate group of reformers — doctors , nurses , hospital executives , social scientists and others — began pushing the idea that there was a better way . Yes , intensive medicine can bring lifesaving benefits , but technologically advanced treatments often don’t work any better than more basic forms .In particular , treatments that work wonders on a small group of patients often spread to a much wider group of people , including many who don’t benefit from them . Induced labor , which does indeed help women and babies facing health risks , is one example . Others include cardiac stents , back surgery and prostate treatment .Armed with reams of evidence , the reformers began pushing hospitals and insurers , including Medicare , to change . In the private market , among other things , insurers have excluded some high-cost doctors from their networks . For all the problems and waste that still exist , the effort has had an effect : Health costs have slowed sharply in the last several years , surprising nearly every expert . Remarkably , per-person spending in Medicare is on a pace to be about 6 percent lower this year than it was three years ago .It’s impossible to know whether the trend will last . But Obamacare , while not the main reason for the slowdown , may be sustaining it . Even as the law has added people to the health-insurance rolls , which increases costs , it has also targeted unnecessary , expensive care .Whether the slowdown will continue is among today’s biggest economic questions . Yet the economic implications aren’t even the most important ones . The health implications are . The idea that we can be healthier with less health care is no longer just wishful thinking ; it’s a serious theory , with growing evidence .Childbirth makes for a crucial case study . It affects everyone , and for centuries was among the biggest dangers women confronted . The maternal death rate per childbirth long approached 1.5 percent , historians estimate .So the notion that modern medicine should be removed from childbirth altogether is clearly wrong . In the United States today , the death rate for mothers in childbirth is less than 0.02 percent . Modern medicine saves the lives of millions of childbearing women — and their infants — every year .Yet as with stents , back surgery and prostate treatments , many believe the medicalization of childbirth almost certainly went too far . “Too much intervention is not a good thing , ” said Dr. Barbara S. Levy , vice president for health policy at the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists . Researchers now agree that nonmedical inductions before 39 weeks are a problem . The next question is whether fetuses continue to get substantial benefits from being in the womb — without much additional risk , for mother or baby — after 39 weeks .It’s a question that affects a lot of births . In 2012 , 30 percent of births came between 39 and 40 weeks , 20 percent came between 40 and 41 weeks and 14 percent came after 41 weeks .Florida offers a window on the issue because the state tracks children from birth through college . ( Historically , most databases that follow individuals over time have been small . ) The authors of the new study — Mr. Figlio ; Jonathan Guryan and Krzysztof Karbownik , also of Northwestern ; and Jeffrey Roth , of the University of Florida College of Medicine — used the data to compare birth weight with test scores from third through eighth grades , as well as with kindergarten readiness scores . They controlled for , among other factors , the health and sex of the baby , the length of the pregnancy and the health , age , race and education of the mother .To test their results , the researchers also looked at twins . Twins are a frequent subject of research , because they share many unobservable environmental conditions . And the effect of birth weight on twins was similar to its effect on single babies . Importantly , the effect was also very similar for same-sex twins ( who can be identical twins , with the same genes ) and different-sex twins ( who can not be identical ) . That similarity suggests that birth weight was not merely a proxy for hidden genetic factors — or hidden fetal conditions — that would remain unaffected by an extra pound or two .The relationship between birth weight and test scores was present by the time children enrolled in kindergarten and remained fairly constant throughout elementary and middle school . Other research has found that children who do better in elementary school are more likely to graduate from college , earn more as adults and live longer .This pattern would fit with the so-called Barker hypothesis . It is the once controversial theory proposed by the late British epidemiologist Dr. David Barker — now largely accepted — that conditions in the womb and infancy cast a lifelong shadow . Many forms of cancer and heart disease , among other conditions , have roots in the earliest stages of life , Dr. Barker argued .The authors of the new paper are continuing to study Florida children and say other researchers should try to confirm or cast doubt on the findings . Without more research , many doctors may be skeptical of changing their habits . Dr. Wendy M. White of the Mayo Clinic said that she would want to make sure that often unobserved health problems , including those unconnected to genes or fetal conditions , weren’t causing both lower birth weights and cognitive gaps .Whatever the uncertainty , the prevalence of the effects across so many groups , in one of the nation’s largest , most diverse states , offers reason to take the results seriously . Some of the implications seem straightforward . Other studies , for example , have found that anti-poverty programs , like food stamps , can increase the weight of babies born to poor mothers . By extension , those programs , which are often derided as wasteful , may have very large health , education and economic benefits .The issue of how to time births is thornier . If the results hold up , we are probably inducing too many babies too soon . On the other hand , there are some risks for babies , and pain for mothers , with longer pregnancies , especially beyond 41 weeks . “There are two patients here , and you want to optimize the outcome for both , ” as Dr. Levy says . It is conceivable that fewer inductions could bring better overall results while also making some rare newborn complications slightly more common .The trade-offs are sometimes unavoidable . But acknowledging and grappling with those trade-offs would still represent a significant shift . For a long time , we have fooled ourselves into thinking that more health care meant better health . The truth may actually be more reassuring .
OK , we’re obviously in for a lot of breathless hype about the new conservatism , as supposedly exemplified by Room to Grow , which self-consciously lays out what are supposed to be bold new conservative policy ideas . One thing you don’t find amid the hype , however , is much actual description of the new ideas in question . That’s because the ideas don’t bear too much scrutiny .The truth is that conservatives have a big intellectual problem . Thirty-five years ago they really did have something new to say — basically , the claim that tax cuts and deregulation would produce widely shared economic gains , a rising tide that would lift all boats , etc.. That hasn’t happened , of course , although the Paul Ryans will never admit it and just keep pushing for more of the same . The new conservatives are at least aware that things haven’t quite worked out as promised — but they’re not willing to challenge fundamental assumptions . So what they write conveys a kind of desperate feeling — they’re trying to tweak the paradigm at the edges , but without straying over the invisible border that would make them basically modern liberals .If you look at the health care chapter , for example , it does two main things . First , it tries to trash Obamacare with borderline dishonest claims — it will leave 31 million American uninsured ! It will cost $ 2 trillion ! If you look at the CBO estimates ( pdf ) these claims are based on , you learn that about a third of those remaining uninsured are unauthorized immigrants the law was never intended to reach , a significant number will be uninsured because Republican-controlled states are refusing to expand Medicaid , and the rest will be uninsured because for whatever reason they choose not to sign up . Oh , and it’s $ 1.8 trillion , fully offset by cost savings and additional revenue .And the conservative alternative is the Coburn plan , which claims to cover as many people as Obamacare much more cheaply . But aside from doubts about the analysis — and would you really want to describe Douglas Holtz-Eakin’s operation as “nonpartisan” ? — as far as we can tell the low cost comes from the fact that many of those who would be supposedly insured would have policies offering very little protection . The point is that the whole thing feels a lot like supply-side snake oil , promising something for nothing .The chapter on tax reform does break some new ground , but some ground shouldn’t be broken . It suggests that the big problem with the welfare state is that people no longer count on their children to support them when they’re old , so birth rates drop — because nothing makes children feel loved and valued like knowing that their parents viewed them as organic 401 ( k ) s. And the answer is tax credits — nonrefundable , of course , so only worthwhile to people with enough income .There’s more . But really , this is all about conservatives trying to deal with the fact that their policy agenda has left ordinary families behind without challenging the mindset and prejudices behind that agenda . As you might guess , the results aren’t impressive .
The estimable Sarah Kliff tabulates all the predictions of Obamacare disaster that didn’t come true ; she puts it at seven major themes , ranging from “the website will never work” to “nobody will sign up” . We can presume , then , that people like John Boehner — who declared that it would never work and that more people would lose insurance than gain it — are spending some time now trying to understand how they could have been so wrong .April fools ! ( Yes , I know it’s July . )I guess there’s always been a human tendency to claim that you were right even when you have been totally wrong . George Orwell put it clearly in “In Front of Your Nose“:The point is that we are all capable of believing things which we know to be untrue , and then , when we are finally proved wrong , impudently twisting the facts so as to show that we were right . Intellectually , it is possible to carry on this process for an indefinite time : the only check on it is that sooner or later a false belief bumps up against solid reality , usually on a battlefield .Actually , if you look at the complete unrepentance of the Cheneys et al , even bumping up against reality on a battlefield seems not to be enough these days . And it does seem to me that denial runs even deeper than it used to ; consider the impossible-to-be-more-wrong Rick Santelli angrily declaring that he was right .It’s probably about partisanship , which means both living in an information bubble and being so deeply committed to a worldview that you literally can’t consider facts that don’t fit .But it’s quite something to behold .
Noah Smith has another post on John Cochrane’s anti-Keynesian screed , in which he takes on various “structural” stories about the continuing weakness of the economy . As usual , Noah is very mild and eager to give the benefit of the doubt , although even so there’s not much there .What I’d like to point out , however , is that there’s an overarching reason not to take any of this stuff seriously . All the anti-Keynesian stories ( except “uncertainty” , which as Nick Rowe points out is actually a Keynesian story but doesn’t know it ) are supply-side stories ; Cochrane even puts scare quotes around the word “demand” . Basically , they’re claiming that unemployment benefits , or Obamacare , or regulations , or something , are reducing the willingness of workers and firms to produce stuff .How would you test this ? In a supply-constrained economy , the kind of monetary policy we’ve had , with the Fed quintupling the size of its balance sheet over a short period of time , would be highly inflationary . Indeed , just about everyone on the right has been predicting runaway inflation year after year .Meanwhile , if you had a demand-side view , and considered the implications of the zero lower bound , you declared that nothing of the sort would happen:Now , the equation [ the quantity equation for money ] still holds . But all that tells us is that any changes in the money supply are offset one for one by changes in velocity …Actually , in the real world it’s even worse , because central banks don’t control the money supply , they only control the monetary base . Broad aggregates like M2 may well be unaffected by what the central bank does : increase the monetary base , and all that happens is an offsetting fall in the money multiplier .( I was arguing against neomonetarism , but the point holds more generally . )Reality:It seems to me that the failure of the inflation predicted by anti-Keynesians to appear — and the fact that this failure was predicted by Keynesian models — is a further big reason not to take what these people are saying seriously .
Alert ( or at least health-care-obsessed ) readers have no doubt been following the coverage of a new study on mortality in Massachusetts in the years following Romneycare’s coverage expansion , the gist of which — the authors found a striking , Massachusetts-specific decline in death rates for the non-elderly — tends to confirm liberal assumptions about the benefits of health insurance , and undercut the conservative and libertarian argument that insurance doesn’t have the impact on health and mortality that most people expect . The study’s findings are an almost-diametrical reversal of the results from Oregon’s Medicaid experiment , which were much discussed around this time last year ( here’s my contribution ) , and which seemed to strengthen the conservative critique of Obamacare’s pursuit of comprehensive coverage . So now it’s liberalism’s turn to claim vindication , and to press Obamacare’s critics to give ground in the debate .And some ground-giving is appropriate . Megan McArdle , among right-of-center writers , has probably written most extensively on the insurance-and-health question , so I think her response to the new study deserves to be quoted at length:… here’s my basic take : The study looks pretty good . It is hard to reconcile these results with Oregon . Good Bayesians will update their beliefs accordingly .… I can think of reasons to believe Oregon rather than Massachusetts : It’s a real [ randomized controlled trial ] , rather than a comparison of counties that are supposed to be similar but might not actually have been in practice . There are surprising results that might be red flags about the data : For instance , cancer mortality dropped , even though the study only ran four years . If the benefit is coming from early detection , I would expect it to take longer to have a significant impact on the data … Massachusetts also has differently sized samples — the control group has about 10 times the population of the treatment group . Since larger groups should tend to have less variance , this might increase the odds of getting a surprisingly good or surprisingly bad result with your treatment group .Most worrying is the period they compared : 2007 to 2010 … The authors are not stupid ; they control for unemployment and poverty . But if the financial crisis affected Massachusetts differently from the rest of the country — and it did — then that may well show up in mortality in ways that are hard to measure .That said , I can also think of reasons to believe Massachusetts over Oregon . The treatment group sample is smaller than the control group by quite a lot , but it’s still huge by comparison with Oregon : 3,900,000 rather than around 6,000 . And Massachusetts is a single comprehensive system , unlike Medicaid , which people might drop in and out of as their income changes , dampening the effect of insurance . The authors find mortality that’s amenable to treatment dropping more rapidly than overall mortality . And comparisons with nearby counties , and with the state’s elderly population , also deliver the same result .So what should we believe ? I haven’t changed my beliefs radically : I still basically think that health insurance improves mortality rates , but that that improvement is unlikely to be huge if you can get results like Oregon . However , after yesterday’s report , I’ve revised the probability of “huge benefits” upward , and you should do the same . And beware of those who are only willing to revise their beliefs in one direction .I completely agree , and I would only add the following point : To the extent that we should revise up the potential health benefits of insurance , we should revise down the extent to which the most rigorous conservative alternative to Obamacare — a reform that would shift the system toward flat , universal subsidies for catastrophic coverage — represents a kind of public policy free ( or at least relatively-inexpensive ) lunch . That is , if the preponderance of the evidence suggests that insurance’s health benefits are relatively limited , policymakers can hope to reap the cost-containing benefits of bigger co-pays and higher deductibles and health savings accounts without worrying too much that they’re creating gaping chasms between the care people need and the care they can afford and get . But if the Massachusetts study , rather than the Medicaid data or the famous RAND health insurance experiment , gets closer to the typical reality of what a health insurance expansion does , then policymakers are faced with a more explicit trade-off , in which what’s saved through market forces by giving people more responsibility for their own health spending has to be balanced against what’s lost in foregone care and treatment . And while having that trade-off suddenly look a lot starker than it has to date wouldn’t settle the overall debate , it would give liberals a stronger case for their approach .As I noted in an earlier post , the mortality issue is one of several plausible metrics for assessing whether Obamacare succeeds or disappoints , and because of the variance in coverage expansions between red and blue states , presumably researchers will be able to push further on this question over the next five or ten years , and the evidence on one side or the other will look more dispositive . Right now , I would only offer a word of caution for liberals , who are ( understandably ) folding this study together with other positive data points ( falling uninsured numbers in Gallup’s polling , a brighter deficit picture , good news on some specific policy targets ) to make a case that the empirically-driven conservative critique of Obamacare is in the early stages of collapse .For all we know it might be , but the reality is that on most questions — mortality , deficits , cost containment , and coverage — we are by definition years away from remotely dispositive assessments . The Massachusetts research is only significant because the authors had years of post-Romney data to examine ; going forward , on just about every metric that matters for Obamacare , we’re looking at a similar timeframe for meaningful numbers and outcomes and results . So if either side , on any of these issues , is going to need to give substantial ground , the only intellectually-responsible way to do it will be … slowly .
Update : And the 4th-ranking Republican in the Senate is already accusing the administration of cooking the books . I really think the possibility that the ACA might actually work never occurred to them .It’s not in itself that big a deal , but I’m somewhat amazed by what amounts to a de facto blackout by major news media on a developing story that’s really obvious if you read the invaluable Charles Gaba , or even the White House blog : a huge surge in Obamacare enrollments in the final days of the signup period . The print sources I read are still putting out basically downbeat reports about the ACA , with maybe a mention 10 paragraphs in that exchange enrollments passed the 6 million mark last week . I don’t watch cable news , but from what I hear it’s all still Malaysian airways .In the end , I guess it won’t matter in a direct sense ; the final number for year 1 , which looks likely to be very close to the original 7 million projection , will eventually come out . But you wonder why news media that are happy to speculate about the 2016 election aren’t interested in at least putting out a heads-up about the strong possibility of a bombshell number next week .And where I think this does matter is that it shows a persistent slant in much reporting toward emphasizing the negatives about health reform . The website woes were , and deserved to be , a big story ; the quite amazing comeback somehow doesn’t fit the preferred narrative , and is being ignored — and this despite the fact that , as Gaba notes , it offers great visuals too .
Did you wake up this morning wondering what would happen at the Conservative Political Action Conference ? No ? Good , you’re a normal person . CPAC , like Christmas , only comes once a year . It’s an occasion for far-flung conservatives to come together in the Washington , D.C. , area and snuggle in that big tent they’re always talking about . At CPAC , conservatives take stock of all things right wing and set the tone for the year ahead . There’s nothing like it on the liberal side , unless you count Burning Man .Long before the main event , pundits parse the speakers list as if it were a sacred , prophetical text , looking for hints of what’s to come . Chris Christie’s invited ! And so is Ted Cruz ! That must mean they’ll both be president . The scheduled panel discussions are less talked about , but equally telling . You can learn quite a bit about the conservative movement , its hopes , obsessions and anxieties , just from the titles .Today’s discussions include:• Does the U.S. Congress Matter Anymore ? Executive Orders AND the Hopelessness of EVER Curtailing Federal Spending . [ Weird capitalization in the original . ] • Healthcare After ObamaCare : A Practical Guide for Living When No One Has Insurance and America Runs Out of Doctors • The American Dream vs. the Obama Nightmare : Income Inequality • When the Feds Stop Buying and the Mint Stops Printing ; Rebuilding the American Economy After a Real Crash • What’s the Deal with Global Warming ? • Rocky Mountain High : Does Legalized Pot Mean Society’s Going Up in Smoke ?The apocalyptic tone is striking . Imagine an America … without doctors , where Congress doesn’t matter , the mint has stopped printing and the best minds of every generation have been destroyed by cannabis ! It’s the stuff of bad movie trailers — with the notable exception of the global warming bit , which sounds like a Jerry Seinfeld joke .That says something about modern conservatism , doesn’t it ? Everything seems dire except the state of the environment . What’s the deal with chopsticks ? Also , what’s the deal with sea levels rising and all that ? You know , the thing all those scientists keep whining about ?
Jared Bernstein agonizes over the role of wonkish analysis ( which spell-check keeps trying to change to “monkish” ) in a political environment in which “facts and smart policy are on the run.” It’s something I worry about too .On one side , if wonks don’t point out what we really should be doing , who will ? To take a current pressing example , it may be that nobody in the British political mainstream is willing to take a stand against austerity , but economists should nonetheless keep pointing out that it’s really bad policy .On the other hand , if wonks only propose things that won’t happen , what good are they ?The best answer I can come up with is to work on two tracks — to talk about first-best policies but also be prepared to support second-best policies if that’s what is on offer . Obamacare is a Rube Goldberg device that is nonetheless much better than nothing — and it’s working . Carbon taxes would be the way to go in a better world , but in this one various administrative actions may be the best you can do .It’s a tricky balancing act . You don’t want to give up on good ideas and make it seem as if flawed political compromises are better than they are — and if they’re bad enough , you have to oppose them . ( And how do we know if they’re bad enough ? Um … . ) But you certainly haven’t done your job if you just lay out your fine theory and walk away from the real choices on offer .Nobody said life would be easy .
The states , said Louis Brandeis , are the laboratories of democracy — although that may not work as well as it used to now that the “I’m not a scientist” wing has taken complete control of the GOP . Still , state experiences can tell the rest of us something . There’s been a lot of talk lately about how the great Kansas tax-cut experiment is doing , namely very badly . But what about the anti-Kansas — California ? It’s a state with a Democratic supermajority . Its policies aren’t left-wing in the way Kansas’s are right-wing , but it’s enough of a liberal agenda to have the right frothing at the mouth . So how is it going ?I wrote about the California comeback more than a year ago , to much vitriolic scorn from the usual suspects . But how’s it going now ?Well , David Cay Johnston tells us that job growth remains fast despite predictions of doom from tax hikes . I found myself wondering , however , whether this was just bounceback from an especially severe slump — after all , California was a major housing bubble state , suffered for it , and you would expect a period of relatively fast growth thereafter even if overall performance was lagging the nation .If you look at the numbers , however , what you see is that while fast job growth has indeed largely reflected recovery from an especially deep slump , at this point California’s performance ( blue ) since the Great Recession began has fully matched that of the nation ( red ) ; that is , there is no sign of growth being hurt by liberal policies or whatever:Meanwhile , the budget is in good shape , with room for some much-needed spending increases .Oh , and California — which enthusiastically went about implementing health reform — appears to have cut the number of uninsured by half in the first year of Obamacare .Is it a miracle ? No — or at any rate not unless you consider any deviation from supply-side predictions miraculous . But it’s looking like a pretty solid record .
Participants in Tennessee’s judicial elections on Thursday rejected a malodorous effort to oust three capable sitting state Supreme Court justices : Chief Justice Gary Wade and Justices Cornelia Clark and Sharon Lee .Conservative Republican groups , including the Republican State Leadership Committee and Americans for Prosperity — part of Charles and David Koch’s big-dollar political operation — underwrote a campaign against the judges . For weeks before Thursday’s election , they bombarded Tennessee with ads depicting them as “soft on crime , ” hostile to business interests and supporters of “the Obama agenda” and “Obamacare.” But this was all nonsense : In fact the judges never ruled on a case involving the health care law .Tennessee voters apparently saw through the lies , a victory not only for the three judges but for elected judges everywhere . The outcome of the election is a sign that judges can sign on to controversial decisions without losing their jobs — despite attack ads .The downside of the judges’ success is that , to achieve it , they raised more than $ 1 million , much of it from lawyers who may appear before them . The judges’ next challenge is to be diligent about avoiding the appearance and reality of improper conflicts-of-interest by recusing themselves from cases involving significant financial backers .“People can smell court tampering and tend to get their backs up , ” says Bert Brandenburg of Justice at State , a group that advocates for the preservation of fair and impartial courts . But he warned that if judges take away from it the need to go out and raise lots more money , courts and ultimately justice will lose .
James Pethokoukis and Ramesh Ponnuru are frustrated . They’ve been trying to convert Republicans to market monetarism , but the right’s favorite intellectuals keep turning to cranks peddling conspiracy theories about inflation . Three years ago it was Niall Ferguson , citing a bogus source . Ferguson was widely ridiculed , by moderate conservatives as well as liberals — but here comes Amity Shlaes , making the same argument and citing the same source . The “reform conservatives” have made no headway at all .Why this lack of progress ?The answer is that inflation paranoia isn’t a simple misunderstanding that can be corrected by pointing to evidence . It’s deeply embedded in the modern conservative psyche . Government action must , by definition , have disastrous results ; and whatever market monetarists may try to say , their political comrades will continue to lump monetary policy in with fiscal stimulus and Obamacare . And fiat money can’t work — Francisco D’Anconia said so , and it must be true . So it’s always the 70s , if not Weimar , and if the numbers say otherwise , they must be cooked . Evidence has a well-known liberal bias .Even the rare conservative willing to admit that we don’t yet have high inflation won’t admit that this suggests something wrong with models that predicted a huge inflation surge . No , it’s just a miracle .So market monetarism isn’t going anywhere , politically . It was conspicuously absent in the Eric Cantor-sponsored book of supposed new ideas — and Cantor himself was knocked out of Congress by a faith-based Randite ( which doesn’t make sense , but sense also has a well-known liberal bias . )Sorry , guys , but you have no home .
HAVING spent the last year reporting for a series of articles on the high cost of American medicine , Iâve heard it all . There was Fred Abrahams , 77 , a skier who had surgery on both ankles for arthritis â one in New York for more than $ 200,000 and one in New Hampshire for less than $ 40,000 . There was Matthew Landman , 41 , billed more than $ 100,000 for antivenin administered in an E.R . after a small rattlesnake bite . There was Robin Miller , a Florida businessman , who needed to buy an implantable defibrillator for his ill brother , who was uninsured ; the machine costs tens of thousands of dollars , but he couldnât get a price for a make or a model .Extreme anecdotes , perhaps . But the series has prompted more than 10,000 comments of outrage and frustration â from patients , doctors , politicians , even hospital and insurance executives .As of Jan. 1 , the Affordable Care Act promises for the first time to deliver the possibility of meaningful health insurance to every American . But where does that leave the United States in terms of affordable care ?Even supporters see Obamacare as a first step on a long quest to bring Americans affordable medicine , with further adjustments , interventions and expansions needed .There are plenty of interesting ideas being floated to help repair the system , many of which are being used in other countries , where health care spending is often about half of that in the United States . For example , we could strictly regulate prices or preset payment levels , as is currently done for hospital stays under Medicare , the national insurance program for people over 65 , or at least establish fair price corridors for procedures and drugs . We could require hospitals and doctors to provide price lists and upfront estimates to allow consumers to make better choices . We could stop paying doctors and hospitals for each service they performed and instead compensate them with a fixed monthly fee for taking care of each patient . We could even make medical school free or far cheaper and then require service afterward .But the nation is fundamentally handicapped in its quest for cheaper health care : All other developed countries rely on a large degree of direct government intervention , negotiation or rate-setting to achieve lower-priced medical treatment for all citizens . That is not politically acceptable here . âA lot of the complexity of the Affordable Care Act arises from the political need in the U.S. to rely on the private market to provide health care access , â said Dr. David Blumenthal , a former adviser to President Obama and president of the Commonwealth Fund , a New York-based foundation that focuses on health care .With that political backdrop , Obamacare deals only indirectly with high prices . By regulating and mandating insurance plans , it seeks to create a better , more competitive market that will make care from doctors and hospitals cheaper . But it primarily relies on a trickle-down theory of cost containment . The Princeton health economist Uwe E. Reinhardt has called it âa somewhat ugly patchâ on âa somewhat ugly system.âWith half a billion dollars spent by medical lobbyists each year , according to the Washington-based Center for Responsive Politics , our fragmented profit-driven system is effectively insulated from many of the forces that control spending elsewhere . Even Medicare is not allowed to negotiate drug prices for its tens of millions of beneficiaries , and Americans are forbidden by law to re-import medicines made domestically and sold more cheaply abroad .And so American patients are stuck with bills and treatment dilemmas that seem increasingly Kafkaesque . The hopeful news is that American health care spending has grown at a slower pace over the past four years . While that is partly because of the recession , economists say , many credit the cost-containing forces unleashed by Obamacare with a significant assist . Even at that rate , many models suggest that nearly 25 percent of gross domestic product will be eaten up by health care in 20 years . That is not sustainable .âItâs like a diet you canât just stop , because itâs starting to work , â said Michael Chernew , an economist at Harvard Medical School . âAnd remember , we havenât even lost weight yet , weâre just gaining weight more slowly.âMany health economists say we must move away from the so-called fee-for-service model , where doctors and hospitals bill every event , every pill , every procedure , even hourly rental of the operating room . Though insurers try to hold down costs by negotiating discounts or limiting reimbursement , this strategy has limited power because armies of consultants now advise hospitals on what is known as âstrategic billingâ : Losing money from trauma patients ? Hospitals can add on a $ 10,000-plus âtrauma activation fee.â Medicare not paying enough for a broken wrist ? Add a separate âcasting feeâ to the bill .
PRIVACY . Selfie . Geek . Science . Four dictionary publishers each selected one of those words as its word of the year for 2013 .

Interest groups love keeping scorecards measuring the fidelity of lawmakers , but to judge the new leaders that House Republicans elected today all you really need to know is how they’d answer the question : Do you believe in governing by consensus or by destruction ? Republicans today elected one of each type , which will probably lead to more tension , more obstruction , and less progress .Kevin McCarthy of California , the new majority leader , is the consensus guy . He supported a clean increase in the debt ceiling in February and helped end the government shutdown last fall . Steve Scalise of Louisiana , the new majority whip , is the obstructionist . He voted against the debt ceiling increase , clearly unconcerned about the effects of a credit default on the economy and on his constituents . And last August , he was one of 80 hard-right members ( right up there with Michele Bachmann , Ted Yoho and Steve King ) who signed a letter saying that their “efforts to repeal Obamacare” were so important that the health law must be de-funded in appropriations bills . That letter , advocating a tactic that was the brainchild of Senator Ted Cruz , helped spark the shutdown .Mr. Scalise’s new job will be to round up votes and enforce the leadership’s will when a bill needs to pass . In the months to come , Congress will have to choose whether to refill the highway trust fund ( which conservatives want to cut ) and reauthorize the Export-Import Bank ( which they want to kill ) . They will have to choose whether to keep the government open when funding runs out at the end of September . And there’s a little thing called “immigration reform.” If Mr. McCarthy and Speaker John Boehner want to cut deals on those measures to avoid further Republican embarrassments just before the midterm elections , just what is Mr. Scalise going to say when he’s asked to find the votes ?The Republican Study Group , the band of policy conservatives that Mr. Scalise has led since 2012 , will want him to say “no” . ( In fact , there are some House extremists who think he isn’t conservative enough , and has tried to push the study group toward the center . The true ideologues live for these battles over minuscule differences . ) He might try to do so behind closed doors , but there will be limits to his ability to dissent . Mr. Scalise has chosen to serve in the leadership , and he will have to do some leading .
By now it’s routine : Another election season , another round of expensive state judicial elections destined to undermine the core American principle of fair and impartial courts .Things got started in earnest at the beginning of May with North Carolina’s judicial primary . Attack ads underwritten largely by out-of-state Republican interest groups charged that a sitting state Supreme Court justice , Robin Hudson , coddled child molesters and “sided with predators” in a dissent while on the bench . Somehow she prevailed despite the negative publicity .Now , a similar battle is taking place in Tennessee in advance of the state’s judicial elections on Aug. 7 . Three capable members of Tennessee’s 5-member Supreme Court — Gary Wade , Cornelia Clark and Sharon Lee — are campaigning to keep their seats in up-or-down retention elections . Distorting attack ads portray the three as soft on crime and the death penalty ( citing a case involving ineffective assistance of counsel ) and as supporters of “the Obama agenda” and “Obamacare” ( even though they have never ruled on a case involving the health care law ) .There is such a thing as reasoned discussion of candidates’ judicial records and philosophy . Plainly , 30- second cheap shots don’t rise to that level .Tennessee’s three targeted judges were appointed by the state’s former Democratic governor , Phil Bredesen ; and the defeat of even one would permit Tennessee’s current Republican governor , Bill Haslam , to name a replacement , creating a Republican majority on the powerful court . These stakes explain the intense assault unleashed against the trio , led by Tennessee’s Republican lieutenant governor , Ron Ramsey , and aided and abetted , it appears , by well-heeled conservative groups .It’s clear from the startling 2010 defeat of three Iowa Supreme Court justices — who’d participated in the unanimous decision to allow same-sex marriage — that judges under attack can’t expect to prevail without fighting back . And that’s exactly what the three targeted judges are doing , raising significant sums and otherwise relying on support from lawyers who appear before them .But no one should feel good about judges having to grovel for money and campaign like ordinary politicians . In their effort to counter the charge they are too liberal for the red state , moreover , the three targeted judges have engaged in some injudicious politicking themselves , stressing that they’ve upheld nearly 90 percent of death sentences , for example . For judges to campaign based on their decisions in criminal cases is a dicey business even when provoked .Still , those who care about judicial independence and integrity should be rooting for the three well-qualified judges . Their ouster would only accelerate the politicization of state justice and send an intimidating message to elected judges nationwide , who may hesitate to render correct but controversial rulings , especially near an election .
Before I continue with my string of posts on the theme of reform conservatism’s correct views on everything , let me make a brief foray into real-world politics : Yesterday Senator Marco Rubio gave a domestic policy speech , co-hosted by Hillsdale College and the YG Network , that’s worth reading if you’re interested in what a reformist vision looks like when it’s an actual Republican politician ( rather than a tribe of conservative scribblers ) giving it form and substance . Naturally , it strikes me as a very impressive and encouraging speech . But I think I would say that even if I were less inclined to agree with its policy specifics , because purely as a rhetorical matter , it does something that Mitt Romney didn’t manage to do in 2012 until , well , basically the first presidential debate : That is , it tries to meet non-conservative voters where they are and talk about the issues that they say they care about , rather than lecturing them on what they should be concerned about ( too few people are paying income tax ! Obama doesn’t like entrepreneurs ! ) and assuming that they’re already persuaded . It’s a speech rooted in conservative principle without being trapped by the conservative talking points , in other words , and that’s something we saw very little of in the 2012 campaign .So where Republicans are inclined to disagree with some of Rubio’s proposals , I would join my friend Reihan Salam in suggesting that they should treat his speech as an opportunity to demand that other would-be leaders ( a Ted Cruz , a Scott Walker , whomever ) step forward with alternatives — and just as importantly , explain how they “expect to secure a durable majority” in their favor . The Republican Party in recent years has featured a great deal of non-substantive debate : The ’12 primary season was full of it ( excepting , of course , 9-9-9 ! ) , and the clashes in the House and Senate leading to the government shutdown over who really wants to repeal Obamacare and who’s a sell-out squish followed a similar pattern , in which affect and tactics were often the main things up for dispute . But that does not have to be the case in the 2016 campaign : If the party’s presidential contenders follow Rubio’s example , the party could have an actual debate about what it believes should replace Obamacare ( a universal tax credit , or something more limited , like what Bobby Jindal has proposed ? ) , what the details of a potential tax reform should look like ( the vigorous online debate over the child tax credit versus deeper top rate cuts belongs in an actual political campaign ) , how the safety net should actually work ( as opposed to just vague promises to cap its growth ) , even how Social Security should be reformed ( champions of private accounts , tell us why Rubio’s proposals don’t go far enough ! ) . Of course it won’t always be a high-minded debate — perish the thought ! — but just having these kind of arguments would be immensely constructive , not only for the party , but for the country it aspires to govern .I would add one other other thought on the speech : I see that Rubio was attacked by Danny Vinik at The New Republic for being insufficiently wonky ( because he hasn’t specified pay-fors for all his education/safety net proposals ) and by Laura Ingraham on Twitter for being insufficiently exciting ( “dare you to try to make it to end of speech w/out nodding off , ” she writes ) . As I’ve said before regarding Rubio’s proposals , the insufficient-specificity complaint strikes me as a bit ridiculous given that 1 ) he’s the only 2016 contender offering anywhere close to this level of detail on policy at this point and 2 ) he’s explicitly endorsed reforms to Medicare and Social Security that would have a much larger impact on the budget than any of his possible tweaks to education outlays . And Ingraham’s insufficiently-exciting complaint sounds a lot like what critics of Bill Clinton always said about his speeches — so long , so much policy , surely voters won’t like this . But they did , and they still do .With that said , though , this is a pincer movement that a substantive G.O.P . campaign will have to cope with — parts of the base will find the approach insufficiently combative and exciting , while the liberal press will demand that every policy proposal meet a legislative , C.B.O.-ready standard that I don’t precisely recall every Obama campaign promise reaching . So Rubio and any other Republican politician who follows his example will need to be prepared for it .
The two big achievements of the Obama administration are health reform and financial reform . ( Maybe carbon regulation will be added to the list ; stay tuned . ) For the most part , however , neither has gotten much respect . I think this may finally be changing on health reform , as the evidence piles up for a dramatic improvement in coverage in states that didn’t obstruct the law . But financial reform is still unloved , attacked by the right as anti-business and by the left as too weak to work .There is , however , an important new GAO report suggesting that reform is mattering a lot on one key hot-button issue : too big to fail . I’m not , however , seeing much clear writing about this ; the always excellent Mike Konczal is on the case , but I suspect that most readers won’t know enough about the background to appreciate what’s going on .So here’s an explanation . If you go back to what happened in 2008 , you had a situation in which the impending collapse of some key financial institutions threatened to bring down the whole world economy . So they were bailed out — with many people complaining that the bailouts rewarded bad behavior . Indeed , some people — including me — argued for taking troubled banks into receivership , so that none of the bailout would go to stockholders . But key officials at Treasury argued that they didn’t have the legal authority .This episode created a concern : now that everyone knew that big financial institutions would be bailed out if they went bad , wouldn’t this ( a ) give such too-big-to-fail institutions a continuing advantage , because their government guaranteed safety would make them able to borrow cheaply , and ( b ) encourage irresponsible behavior ? And there was a fair bit of evidence for ( a ) : large financial institutions did indeed seem to have a funding advantage .To deal with this , Dodd-Frank created Ordinary Liquidation Authority , otherwise known as resolution authority — giving the government the legal authority to seize institutions the way it arguably should have in 2008-2009 .But Republican leaders fiercely opposed financial reform — and claimed that resolution authority actually made too-big-to-fail worse , because it institutionalized bailouts . This always seemed implausible ; bailouts will happen in crises , one way or another . And if financial reform was a giveaway to the banks , why did Wall Street , which used to look relatively favorably on Democrats , turn overwhelmingly Republican after reform passed ?Still , you’d like some evidence . And GAO has the goods . There was indeed a large-bank funding advantage during and for some time after the crisis , but it has now been diminished or gone away — maybe even slightly reversed . That is , financial markets are now acting as if they believe that future bailouts won’t be as favorable to fat cats as the bailouts of 2008 .This news is part of broader evidence that Dodd-Frank has actually done considerable good , on fronts from consumer protection to bank capitalization . Of course it should have been stronger ; and I don’t expect it ever to look as good as Obamacare increasingly does . But claims that it was counterproductive now look like claims that black is white . Are you surprised ?
I AM a genetic Republican .Five generations of Tafts have served our nation as unwaveringly stalwart Republicans , from Alphonso Taft , who served as attorney general in the late 19th century , through William Howard Taft , who not only was the only person to be both president of the United States and chief justice of the United States but also served as the chief civil administrator of the Philippines and secretary of war , to my cousin , Robert Taft , a two-term governor of Ohio .As I write , a photograph of my grandfather , Senator Robert Alphonso Taft , looks across at me from the wall of my office . He led the Republican Party in the United States Senate in the 1940s and early 1950s , ran for the Republican nomination for president three times and was known as âMr . Republican.â If he were alive today , I can assure you he wouldnât even recognize the modern Republican Party , which has repeatedly brought the United States of America to the edge of a fiscal cliff â seemingly with every intention of pushing us off the edge .Throughout my familyâs more than 170-year legacy of public service , Republicans have represented the voice of fiscal conservatism . Republicans have been the adults in the room . Yet somehow the current generation of party activists has managed to do what no previous Republicans have been able to do â position the Democratic Party as the agents of fiscal responsibility .Speaking through the night , Senator Ted Cruz , with heavy-lidded , sleep-deprived eyes , conveyed not the libertarian element in Republican philosophy that advocates for smaller government and less intrusion into the personal lives of citizens , but a new , virulent strain of empty nihilism : âblow it up if we canât get what we want.âThis recent display of bomb-throwing obstructionism by Republicans in Congress evokes another painful , historically embarrassing chapter in the Republican Party â that of Senator Joseph McCarthy , chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations , whose anti-Communist crusade was allowed by Republican elders to expand unchecked , unnecessarily and unfairly tarnishing the reputations of thousands of people with âRed Scareâ accusations of Communist affiliation . Finally Senator McCarthy was brought up short during the questioning of the United States Armyâs chief counsel , Joseph N. Welch , who at one point demanded the senatorâs attention , then said : âUntil this moment , Senator , I think I never really gauged your cruelty or your recklessness.â He later added : âHave you no sense of decency , sir ? At long last , have you left no sense of decency ? âWatching the Republican Party use the full faith and credit of the United States to try to roll back Obamacare , watching its members threaten not to raise the debt limit â which Warren Buffett rightly called a âpolitical weapon of mass destructionâ â to repeal a tax on medical devices , I so wanted to ask a similar question : âHave you no sense of responsibility ? At long last , have you left no sense of responsibility ? âThere is more than a passing similarity between Joseph McCarthy and Ted Cruz , between McCarthyism and the Tea Party movement . The Republican Party survived McCarthyism because , ultimately , its excesses caused it to burn out . And eventually party elders in the mold of my grandfather were able to realign the party with its brand promise : The Republican Party is ( or should be ) the Stewardship Party . The Republican brand is ( or should be ) about responsible behavior . The Republican party is ( or should be ) at long last , about decency .What a long way we have yet to go .
The health care ads being run by Americans for Prosperity — one of the many frantically waving arms of the Koch brothers — are a gift to fact checkers everywhere . Because they deliberately twist the truth to persuade people to “stop supporting Obamacare , ” they have become a machine for producing “Pinocchios , ” the mendacity rating system used by Glenn Kessler at The Washington Post .In today’s installment , Mr. Kessler gave two Pinocchios ( out of four ) to three A.F.P . ads that went up this week . He dinged the ad below for falsely claiming that health insurance premiums are up by 90 percent in New Hampshire .And he criticized this series of ads for suggesting that hundreds of thousands of people in Michigan and Colorado lost their insurance because of the Affordable Care Act , without pointing out that many of those policies were later extended or renewed .Those Pinocchios are fine as far as they go . But since this is an editorial-page blog , we can go a little further than Mr. Kessler and toss many more long noses at the Koch ads . ( Does this dial go to 11 ? )What’s truly erroneous about all these ads ( the full series of which is available on the A.F.P . website , if you have the fortitude ) isn’t so much what they say as what they never say . They give viewers the impression that all the pre-existing problems with the health insurance system are the fault of Mr. Obama’s law , never bothering to explain how bad things have been for decades .For example , it’s true that health insurance premiums will be going up for some people under the new system , in most cases because they will have better coverage . But premiums for private insurance have been rapidly escalating for years , far beyond inflation . Since 2003 , they went up by 80 percent , according to the Kaiser Family Foundation , nearly three times as fast as wages and inflation . And the ads never mention the millions who will now get insurance coverage for free or extremely low cost because of the program’s subsidies . Those people aren’t the Kochs’ intended audience .Similarly , insurance companies used to routinely cancel individual policies , sometimes because the policy holders got sick , or because the companies decided not to do business in a state or region anymore . They can’t do that now . But the ads never mention that , instead falsely suggesting that vast numbers of ordinary people have been left without coverage because of the law .As Politico reported yesterday , a new study says that millions of the so-called “cancelled” policies under the Affordable Care Act ( which were actually policy upgrades ) would have been cancelled anyway by the policyholders . Most people who have individual policies don’t keep them for longer than a year , either because they join a new employer’s plan or change their own policies .That’s the kind of context you will never get in a Koch ad , whether or not the texts of the ads are literally correct . The billionaires behind this effort are on a crusade to end Democratic control of the Senate and ultimately to discredit the idea that government can improve people’s lives through a social program . Context just gets in their way .
If you care deeply about the distinctions between various types of Republicans – not a hobby I’d recommend for those without professional training – you might be aware that Thad Cochran of Mississippi is not a particularly conservative senator .Most liberals probably dismiss him as hopelessly retrograde , like the rest of his party . After all , as he put it in an ad for his re-election , he’s the only candidate in the race who has been endorsed by the National Rifle Association . He’s “voted against Obamacare more than 100 times.” And he has what he calls a “100 percent pro-life voting record , ” as compiled by the National Right to Life Committee .But for conservatives , Mr. Cochran is no conservative . He might have been by the standards of 1978 , when he first came to the Senate , but the Republican Party has passed him by on its rush to the right , and now a Tea Party candidate has a pretty good shot at defeating him in the June 3 primary . Mr. Cochran spent too many years getting federal projects for his state , and even provided federal aid after Hurricane Katrina .By contrast , his opponent , a state senator named Chris McDaniel , isn’t even sure he supports federal disaster spending .Mr. McDaniel is being assisted by several well-funded outside groups who have long had their eyes on Mr. Cochran for various crimes against conservatism . In an ad released on Monday , the Club for Growth goes through the list : Mr. Cochran voted with President Jimmy Carter ( the narrator practically laughs at the last name ) to “massively expand federal control of education.” That’s apparently a reference to the 1979 vote that created the Department of Education . He supported the 1990 tax increase that made President George H.W . Bush break his “read my lips” pledge . And worst of all , he voted with President Obama to “raise the national debt by trillions” ( this refers to a decision not to let the government default on its debts ) .“Thad Cochran — five decades in Washington is enough , ” the ad says .Freedom Works Action , a Tea Party group , has an ad calling Mr. Cochran “the ultimate insider . “In just the last six years , he’s voted for over $ 36 billion of pork , ” the ad says . “And not a dime of that money came to Mississippi.”The last sentence muddies the message a bit , a reminder of the old axiom that there’s nothing worse than pork that doesn’t benefit local voters .But the larger point is clear : Mr. Cochran no longer fits in a Republican Party that values purity above governance , and needs to be purged as Richard Lugar and Robert Bennett were before him .As another right-wing insurgent group , the Madison Project , explains on its website , Mr. Cochran may have voted against various health-reform provisions , but he has voted for federal budgets that paid for the law . ( In other words , he opposes shutting down the government to block the law . ) He’s voted for background checks for guns , and his anti-abortion record isn’t as solid as he says it is .They’re right about that . Mr. Cochran’s “100 percent pro-life voting record” is only true for the last few Congresses . If you go back a few years on the National Right to Life website , you’ll see that Mr. Cochran dared to vote for stem-cell research in 2006 , and fetal-tissue research in 1997 .Those kinds of votes — courageous if he repeated them now — are why Mr. Cochran is struggling hard against the new mainstream of his party in a close primary race that seems eons away from 1978 .
THE Obama administration has made a curious strategic choice in its defense of the constitutionality of the health care reform act . The central issue before the Supreme Court , which will begin hearing oral arguments on Monday , is whether the act’s requirement that everyone buy health insurance — the so-called individual mandate — exceeds Congress’s constitutional power .The act’s other provisions regulating health insurance — like the requirement that health insurance companies take all applicants , regardless of pre-existing illnesses , and the prohibition against charging sicker patients higher rates — have not been challenged . And yet the administration is arguing that the individual mandate is not “severable” from these regulations ; if the mandate falls , they must as well , and health insurance companies would once again be free to choose whom to cover .But if the court were to strike down the individual mandate , it should stop there : that would be quite bold enough . The Supreme Court has long affirmed a “presumption in favor of severability , ” meaning that when it rules that a statutory provision is unconstitutional , the decision should affect as little of the law as possible . As Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said , while speaking for the court in 2010 , making more extensive changes would constitute “editorial freedom” that “belongs to the legislature , not the judiciary.”It is Congress , not the court , that has the constitutional power and responsibility to make difficult legislative policy decisions like these . By arguing against severability , the Obama administration — and the law’s opponents , who are making an even more radical claim — is urging the Supreme Court to abandon its tradition of judicial restraint , to ignore longstanding precedents and to undermine the separation of powers .Perhaps it comes as no surprise that the opponents of the law , which they call “Obamacare , ” agree with the administration on this crucial point . They have even urged the Supreme Court to strike down the entire statute , including the act’s many provisions that have nothing to do with health insurance coverage , like those relating to doctor training and the regulation of certain drugs . They would like nothing more than for the court to save Congress the trouble of having to muster the votes to try to repeal the law .To this end , the law’s opponents have advanced several specious arguments . Because the act is so complex , they say , the court does not have the expertise to decide whether only one provision can be excised from it . In addition , because the statute was the product of hard-fought political compromise , every provision was necessary to secure a majority of votes , and the removal of any one would upset the delicate deal that was struck .But complexity is a key reason for the severability doctrine in the first place : it is Congress that has the expertise and responsibility to decide what should be kept absent the individual mandate . And virtually every statute reflects a bundle of political deals . If either of these arguments is accepted , it would destroy the doctrine of severability entirely .Both the Obama administration and the law’s opponents have one argument in common . They express concern about what might happen to health insurance markets if the mandate is severed from the statute but the requirements that insurance companies cover sick patients and don’t charge them higher rates remain . If healthy people do not have to buy insurance and insurance companies are forced to cover the sick , they warn , insurance would be far more expensive . No doubt rates would rise as a result . But the size of that increase — whether it would be 10 percent or 20 percent , as some claim — is unknown , and the Supreme Court is in no position to make that judgment on its own .It’s not clear why the Obama administration has chosen this course . Perhaps it made a strategic choice to raise the stakes of striking down the mandate by asking the court to also invalidate the law’s more popular provisions . Or it may be concerned that , if the mandate alone is struck down , there would not be enough votes in Congress to pass new provisions to compensate the insurance industry for its loss . But as a legal matter , the court should reject the argument .We believe that imposing the mandate was within Congress’s powers to regulate commerce and that the legislation should be upheld . But if the Supreme Court strikes the mandate down , the rest of the law should stand , and Congress should have to decide what happens next .Why should an unelected court free the insurance industry from having to do its own political lobbying work in Congress ? Why should the court choose whether or not to deny injured and sick Americans health insurance ? These crucial decisions must be left to our elected officials , who — unlike the Supreme Court — can then be held accountable for them by the voting public .
My Sunday column divided American conservatism’s would-be populist reformers into two camps , “reform conservatives” and “libertarian populists , ” and tried to briefly describe the overlap and distinctions between the two . I’ve made this distinction before , and like any binary it’s in some sense artificial : You could easily fold both groups into a broad reformist tendency , or disaggregate them further into smaller camps . But I do think the typology is pretty useful , for various reasons — one of which is that it helps clarify two of the gravitational pulls ( from very different directions ) that today’s conservative reformers need to at least partially escape .To see what I mean about those pulls , let me quote Ben Domenech , who first popularized the term “libertarian populist , ” using his newsletter to respond to my own and Ramesh Ponnuru’s attempts to distinguish our ideas from Bush-era compassionate conservatism:… compassionate conservatism such as it is – a marketing gimmick which deploys altruism in defense of big government solutions – is very much alive … among the nation’s Republican governors . John Kasich and Mike Pence and Chris Christie are all expanding Medicaid under Obamacare by deploying the same familiar terms of caring about the downtrodden and having a heart for the poor – citing the need to follow the path of Jesus and Reagan as their motivation for taxing others to pay for entitlements . Describing a permanent expansion of an entitlement for childless able-bodied adults as a hand up not a hand out is classic compassionate conservatism …Now in context , this talk of compassionate conservatism rebranding is aimed at the efforts of the reform conservatives , who are eager to avoid the critique that this is just a bunch of Bush veterans attempting to rebrand their past policy agenda in terms which can survive in the new climate of the right .To the extent that their ideas are attempting to make compassionate conservatism actually conservative , their work has merit – to the extent that their ideas are relocation grants and wage subsidies and Keynesian transportation projects , not so much ( “Everybody always starts with Michael Strain ! ” ) . To a large extent , the more skeptical reformers are of government action , the more their ideas resist this accusation . As John Podhoretz noted in his 2008 review of Michael Gerson’s Heroic Conservatism , the most troubling aspect of this defense of compassion was its historically revisionist depiction of the heartlessness of welfare reform … Thus I don’t think it’s fair to describe Paul Ryan’s attempts , which largely accept the lessons of those reforms , in these terms .… That’s why what reformers are advancing requires the acceptance of the anti-cronyism , anti-corporatist element of the agenda as essential , not just window dressing . In a sense , it’s a demonstration of good faith : that they are willing to take on established interests in a way which could prove painful , just as we’ve seen politicians on the left do in the past . The more one is willing to take sides against such interests , the more you can be trusted as someone who isn’t just trying to rebrand the Bush domestic policies .I think that most of this argument is both fair-minded and important . For reform conservatism , there is an obligation to explain ( as we’ve tried to do ) why ours isn’t just a politics that reliably deploys the rhetoric of altruism or compassion “in defense of big government solutions , ” and why our preferred policies wouldn’t just cycle the G.O.P . back into the same K Street Project/”deficits don’t matter” miasma that came to define the Bush era’s attempt at a fresh center-right policy approach . And Domenech is right that the anti-corporatist , anti-insider element in the reform agenda is one of the places ( the other , I would say , being entitlement reform ) where the limited-government rubber hits the road : By prioritizing issues that libertarians tend to care about and the Bush-era party didn’t really touch — corporate welfare , market-distorting regulations , the tax code’s giveaways to rentiers — reform conservatism can escape ( or try to ) the gravitational pull of big government conservatism , and demonstrate that ours isn’t just the royal road back to the reign of Tom DeLay .But I think the middle of his argument points to a gravitational pull that’s problematic for libertarian populists — namely , the tug of a libertarianism too dogmatic to temper its skepticism of government action with an awareness that certain governmental interventions actually might work . Domenech first criticizes the “relocation grants and wage subsidies” element in reform conservatism’s policy portfolio , and then suggests ( reasonably ) that reform conservatism should be judged , in part , by whether it seems to follow in the footsteps of the mid-1990s welfare reform … without acknowledging that one of the reasons that welfare overhaul seems to have worked reasonably well for the poor ( contributing to lower poverty rates , lower child poverty rates , , etc . ) was that it was packaged together with , well , wage subsidies like the E.I.T.C . And yes , absent those interventions , there would have still been a principled limited-government case for the reform … but more liberal prophecies about its impact on poverty rates might have been vindicated , and fewer non-libertarian observers would have been inclined to see it as a success .Or so I think , at least . Today’s libertarian populists don’t have to agree with that assessment , and if they do allow that it has merit , that doesn’t require them to support further wage supports right now . But just as Domenech’s advice for reform conservatives is worth taking seriously , I hope he and others take seriously the need to make sure that their libertarianism doesn’t swallow their populism on issues where conservative public policy might be able to actually offer the working poor and working class a genuine hand up .
I haven’t commented on the border situation since my column a few weeks ago , mostly because it’s the kind of situation ( there are so many these days ) where it’s easier to say what should have been done in the past than to figure out what the correct policy course is right now . But as House Republicans debate what kind of legislative response they intend to support , I want to say something briefly about the argument that they shouldn’t back any response at all , on the theory that since the president has already claimed sweeping , dubiously-legal powers over spending flows and immigration enforcement , fixing the mess should be his responsibility alone .That’s the case that Conn Carroll presses here , citing the White House’s creative funding moves with Obamacare’s exchanges and its suspension of deportations for younger illegal aliens as evidence that in this case , too , the president could simply spend more and speed deportations on his own initiative , notwithstanding the official absence of money and the apparent letter of the law forbidding swift repatriation of juveniles from Central America . And unless the White House wants to walk back its earlier power grab , Carroll argues , that’s exactly what the G.O.P . should let happen here:Until Obama admits his entire DACA program [ the halt to deportations for immigrants brought here as children ) is blatantly illegal , and that his funding of Obamacare exchanges was also blatantly illegal , and then acts to enforce federal laws and appropriations as written … there simply is zero reason for Republicans in Congress to do anything .Obama has repeatedly proven through both his actions and rhetoric that he could care less what federal law , or appropriations , say . He is going to do what he wants to do anyway .Republicans must refuse to legitimize this farce .I share Carroll’s frustration with the president’s conduct of immigration policy , but I don’t think the logic here quite makes sense . Republicans would be responding to a presidential power grab in one area by essentially demanding that he expand that power grab even further , and washing their own hands of a crisis situation while they wait to see if he’ll act without them . Wouldn’t that kind of stand-down legitimize presidential overreach much more than passing the actual bill that Republicans believe is legally and constitutionally required ?It would be one thing if the G.O.P . genuinely didn’t think anything should be done about the current crisis : Then they could stand by their inaction on principle and blast the president for making extralegal moves . But the party’s official ( and correct ! ) position is that we need more funding for immigration enforcement , both in the context of the current inflow and more generally , and that the Wilberforce Act’s guarantee of hearings should not be applied to most of today’s child migrants . Regardless of what the president does or doesn’t do , I just don’t see what Republicans lose from passing legislation that reflects both positions : If the president fails to execute it faithfully or if it ends up amended in some counterproductive way , they can attack the White House and the Democrats for that , without carrying the burden of looking like do-nothings who are weirdly demanded more of the kind of executive “creativity” they officially oppose .There is also the argument , raised by Mickey Kaus , that House Republicans shouldn’t pass anything because it wouldn’t just get amended or creatively interpreted , but because it could set in motion a conference process that could lead to a comprehensive reform being essentially smuggled through the House . Now I bow to no one in my belief that some Republican leaders would love to somehow put one over on their conservative constituents on this issue , but I also do not believe that the Republican leadership is literally insane . And allowing the Kaus “Trojan Horse” scenario to unfold , just before a midterm election , with party unity fragile ( especially on this issue ) , with polls moving in the G.O.P.’s direction on immigration for the first time in a while … well , it would be the most extraordinary act of Republican self-immolation I can possibly imagine , and that’s really saying something .And again , in order to close the door on the extremely-slim possibility of a suicidal betrayal by their leadership , House Republicans would end up sitting on their hands , punting to the White House , and essentially shirking legislative obligations that they themselves believe they have . I may be missing something here , but I just don’t see how that makes sense .
HANOVER , N.H. — NOW that it’s clear that Obamacare is here to stay , its supporters should focus on making the program better . Fixes are not a sign of weakness . They are a sign of responsiveness and of good management . And the Affordable Care Act does have its flaws . Here’s a big one : It favors screening over diagnosis .While the distinction may seem arcane , it has real-world implications . Screening is what we offer to the well ; it’s the effort to find abnormalities in those who do not have signs or symptoms of disease . Because screening is considered part of preventive care under the Affordable Care Act , it is provided at no charge .Diagnosis is what we offer to those who do have signs or symptoms of disease . Because diagnosis is not preventive care , it is subject to deductibles and co-payments .In other words : A woman over 40 can have a free screening mammogram . But if she notices a breast lump and goes to her doctor to have it evaluated , she’ll pay for a diagnostic mammogram . That could cost $ 300 . So the woman at lower risk for cancer — the one with no signs or symptoms of the disease — has an incentive to be tested , while the woman at higher risk — the one with the lump — faces a disincentive .Does that make any sense ? No . But it could encourage women with breast lumps not to report their symptoms .Just how crazy this is became apparent to me when a friend enrolled on the New Hampshire exchange . Melissa is a 50-something self-employed author . She chose to be screened for colon cancer using the test doctors are most certain lowers colon cancer mortality — annual fecal occult blood testing .Melissa’s screening test was free under the Affordable Care Act . It was also positive — she had blood in her stool , meaning she was at higher risk to actually have colon cancer . Everyone agreed about the next step : a diagnostic colonoscopy , to figure out where the blood was coming from . That’s not free ; it’s real money , thousands of dollars . But had she chosen the colonoscopy as her first screening test , it would have been free .Melissa contacted her insurer , and a representative suggested she ask her gastroenterologist to resubmit the colonoscopy claim as preventive . Pressure on doctors to recode diagnostic tests as screening tests is the inevitable result of this “incentive mismatch” between screening and diagnosis . But it’s also fraud , and Melissa knew it was wrong .The gastroenterologists already got one fix in the Affordable Care Act . At first , screening colonoscopy was free , but if the test found a polyp , it was correctly reclassified as a diagnostic procedure , and was subject to cost sharing . In February 2013 , regulators fixed the problem , saying insurance companies must also make polyp removal during screening free , noting , “polyp removal is an integral part of a colonoscopy.”It’s true : Subsequent interventions are an integral part of all screening . Were I a mammographer , I’d happily argue that additional mammographic views , ultrasounds , M.R.I.s and breast biopsies are all part of screening .But if you notice a new breast lump , you pay .I wish money wasn’t such a powerful incentive in medical care . But the economists are right : Incentives matter . Right now they favor lower risk patients ( those being screened ) over higher risk ones ( those with signs and symptoms ) .They also encourage a feeding frenzy among providers to recategorize diagnostic testing as screening . Free screenings were seen as a way to get people through the door and ideally to find and address problems before they become more dangerous and expensive .But in practice , it may not work this way . Some hospitals offer free screening knowing full well that the costs will be more than made up for by all the subsequent services required . More testing , false alarms and overdiagnosis are all part of screening . And if you make it free , patients are less likely to give proper consideration to these potential harms — not to mention the potential for a lot of out-of-pocket costs down the line .Here’s the fix : Eliminate the incentive mismatch between screening and diagnosis . Treat them equally . Melissa would share in the cost of her fecal occult blood test . ( But at around $ 10 to $ 20 , it’s still roughly one one-hundredth of the cost of a colonoscopy . )We need people to consider medical care carefully , and that’s what cost sharing is all about . Patients already share costs on what is arguably the most important preventive service , treatment for really high blood pressure , and for procedures as necessary as setting a broken leg . Why would we treat a much closer call — screening — any different ?But if you think the need for this fix is evidence that the Affordable Care Act should be repealed , think again . Melissa had a mammogram at age 29 because her doctor thought she felt a lump . It was just fibrous tissue , but as a result , insurance companies put a rider on her policy disqualifying her from coverage for breast cancer . That’s right : Before the Affordable Care Act , if she developed the cancer that leads to the most deaths among nonsmoking women , she would not have been covered . No one wants to go back there .

DETROIT â I KNOW an old woman who hasnât opened her windows in a decade , afraid that whatâs outside will climb inside . Inside , there is the stale odor of dead air .I know another woman who called me about a corpse lying outside her window for six and a half hours . This was because of cutbacks at the morgue . No dignity in death here . They do it better in Baghdad .The latest trend ? When a person is murdered , he is thrown into an abandoned house , and it is set on fire . There are tens of thousands to choose from .I know of an 11-year-old boy who was shot , the bullet going clean through his arm . The cops stuffed him in the back of a squad car and rushed him to the hospital . Thatâs how we do it . There was no ambulance available . About two-thirds of the cityâs fleet is broken on an average day .I know a cop who drives around in a squad car with holes in the floorboards . There is no computer , no air-conditioning , the odometer reading 147,000 miles . His bulletproof vest has expired . His pay has been cut 10 percent .I knew a firefighter who died in a fire , but not from the fire . He died when the roof of an abandoned house collapsed on him and his brethren could not find him because his homing alarm was broken and did not sound . He suffocated .In our town , the 911 dispatch system recently went down for 15 hours , and no one seemed to give a damn . When the system is running , the average wait is 58 minutes . Firefighters canât use hydraulic ladders on fire trucks to do their jobs unless there is an âimmediate threat to life.â In a fire â imagine that . The ladders havenât been inspected in years .If this were New York , these stories would have ricocheted around the world . But this is Detroit and , of course , nobody gives a damn . Even here people have been conditioned to accept these things as normal , a nuisance , the buzz of a fly .This numbness , in a peculiar way , is a sign of strength . People here manage to get along somehow .So we went broke , bust , bankrupt . Weâve known that in Detroit for years . Only now it is official with a Chapter 9 filing last week . The biggest municipal default in United States history â at least $ 18 billion . Suddenly , America gives a rip .How did it get this way , Iâm asked ? After all , it was just 99 years ago that Henry Ford offered the workingman $ 5 a day and profit-sharing . How , in less than a century , did it come to this ?The short answers : municipal mismanagement , race riots , white flight , black flight , dead flight ( people routinely disinter their deceased and relocate them to the suburbs ) . There were the overreaching unions and management that couldnât balance a ball . Proof ? The multibillion-dollar bailout of the auto industry . Thank you , American taxpayers !Then there is our spectacular civic corruption : A former mayor , Kwame M. Kilpatrick , waits for a bed in federal prison , convicted of extortion , racketeering and bribery . He looted the city of millions of dollars and stole the future of thousands of children . They can send him to hell for all I care . I donât want to pay for his upkeep . But thank you , taxpayers ! You will pay for it . And the ex-mayorâs team of super lawyers will also be paid with the public dime .So Detroit files for bankruptcy . What does this mean ? Pay close attention because it may be coming to you soon , Los Angeles , Baltimore , Chicago , Philadelphia . In 2011 , Moodyâs calculated the unfunded liabilities for Illinoisâs three largest state-run pension plans to be $ 133 billion . ( It is expected to be even larger this year . ) Thatâs the size of six Detroit bankruptcies â give or take a few hundred million .Of Detroitâs debt of at least $ 18 billion , about $ 7 billion is secured by collateral like casino revenues and utility taxes . That means creditors â read : big banks â will get paid . Of the remaining $ 11 billion dollars or so in unsecured debt , about $ 9 billion is owed to retirees and current municipal workers , people like firefighters and police officers . These debts come in the form of promised pension checks and health care benefits , all backed by a false , unsecured promise . These are the people who are likely to lose out .In simple math , do we sacrifice 30,000 former and current workers to save a city of 700,000 people and their progeny ? Most Detroiters will tell you yes . Donât judge . We feel bad about it . But weâre simply Americans . We are a gaunt dog . We are desperate . And you are watching and studying us .Pension checks will be much smaller than planned and health care benefits will get foisted off on Medicaid and Obamacare . Thanks again , taxpayers !There is hope up here on the Great Lakes . We have fresh water , profitable auto companies , more than $ 130 billion a year in trade with Canada crossing through our city , a world-class research university and , eventually , a clean balance sheet . Hey , it helps to be first . What do you have , Atlanta ?So come visit Detroit , my fellow Americans . Come take a look at your future . Come give the tires a kick . And if you want your money back , come strip copper pipes and wiring from the abandoned buildings â if you can find any copper . Chances are , someone beat you to it .
For our time off together around Christmas , my siblings , their children and I recently began plotting an excursion to the Six Flags amusement park in the Los Angeles area . The discussion turned quickly from roller coasters to perks . To status . To just how high weâre prepared to fly in this service-obsessed , luxury-laden , class-fractured era of ours .Do we occupy the dizziest heights of privilege ? Or is ours a humbler altitude , and by how much ? Six Flags doesnât use that language , but it might as well , because it offers some half-dozen gradations of access and coddling , from a high-priced position near the front of every line to a much less expensive ticket and much longer waits . There are levels â regular , gold , platinum â and they suggest that the experience is more than just a sprawling day of dips , whirls and happy shrieks . Itâs a referendum on your very station in society . I donât recall anything quite like it from the amusement parks of my youth . Back then our lives as consumers , and as Americans , didnât seem so relentlessly tiered .Much has been made of commercial flights these days , with all those divisions between first class and coach . For various supplements or with various deals , you can get a few more inches of legroom or , shy of that , a prime aisle seat . You can get to board earlier or later , and thus hoard or miss out on the overhead bins . Will it be long before thereâs a ranked queue for the bathroom ? Iâm not even sure Iâm kidding .Itâs not that pecking orders or badges of affluence are anything new . Our homes , cars , clubs and clothes have long been advertisements of our economic clout , used and perceived that way .But lately , the places and ways in which Americans are economically segregated and stratified have multiplied , with microclimates of exclusivity popping up everywhere . The plane mirrors the sports arena , the theater , the gym . Is it any wonder that class tensions simmer ? In a country of rising income inequality and an economy thatâs moved from manufacturing to services , one thing we definitely make in abundance is distinctions .When I grew up , school essentially came in two sizes : public or private . Now , private is a starting point , with many costly but broadly employed add-onâs : the tutor for specific subjects ; the tutor for SATs ; the individual sports coach ; the college-admissions consultant , whose fee can exceed $ 5,000 .With taxis as with Boeings , there are degrees of pampering . Uber , a relatively new car service in dozens of American cities , allows you to specify , just minutes before your vehicleâs arrival , precisely how regal and roomy it should be . If you see yourself in an S.U.V. , then an S.U.V . is the chariot in which others will see you , too .Broadway theaters have premium seating , which is so expensive that a high roller can often get the best real estate at the last minute . Itâs as if scalping has come out of the closet , louder and prouder in an age of unapologetic elitism . Luxury boxes now take up more space in stadiums than ever ; elsewhere in some ballparks , the differences between sections involve not just better views but finer food and a more solicitous staff .No sooner does a fitness trend appear than it spawns strata , so that you can spin in candlelight at SoulCycle , in less gilded trappings at Crunch , or in bare-bones fashion at the Y.M.C.A . Thereâs an accordant price scale . Even the fanciest gyms have rungs of enhanced fanciness , such as executive locker rooms . At Equinox , trainers are designated by numbers â Tiers 1 , 2 and 3 â that signal their experience and hourly rate , and there are deluxe inner sanctums within certain Equinox clubs . They use eye-scanning technology to figure out who belongs .Bronze , silver , gold , platinum : a vocabulary once associated with jewelry or Olympic medals is now attached to your Hertz status , your Delta level , your Obamacare plan , establishing how far forward or back in the pack you belong , herding you into categories that sound suspiciously like evaluations of worth . This is how precious you are .And while part of whatâs happening is just a refinement of niche marketing and personalized service for the wealthiest Americans at the tippy top , the stratification travels beyond and below that echelon , to communal events at which everyone can see which plateau everyone else inhabits , Six Flags being an example .It has something called The Flash Pass , named for the superhero . A regular version of it costs at least $ 50 on top of general admission , but for at least $ 80 , you get faster access to rides , and for $ 110 , you get that plus the ability to go around on a ride twice in a row . Your second spin pre-empts some eager , nearby aspirantâs first .For reasons besides thrift , my vote is that my family not go that route .
WASHINGTON â THE Tea Party has a new crusade : preventing illegal immigrants from gaining citizenship , which they say is giving amnesty to lawbreakers . Judson Phillips , the founder of Tea Party Nation , recently told Politico that his members were âmore upset about the amnesty bill than they were about Obamacare.âTheyâre so upset , in fact , that Republican supporters of immigration reform , like Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina , have become marked men in their party , while House Republicans have followed the Tea Party lead by refusing to even consider the Senateâs bipartisan reform plan .Tea Partyers often style themselves as disciples of Thomas Jefferson , the high apostle of limited government . But by taking the ramparts against immigration , the movement is following a trajectory that looks less like the glorious arc of Jeffersonâs Republican Party than the suicidal path of Jeffersonâs great rivals , the long-forgotten Federalists , who also refused to accept the inexorable changes of American demography .The Federalists began as the faction that supported the new Constitution , with its âfederalâ framework , rather than the existing model of a loose âconfederationâ of states . They were the national party , claiming to represent the interests of the entire country .Culturally , however , they were identified with the ancient stock of New England and the mid-Atlantic , as the other major party at the time , the Jeffersonian Republicans ( no relation to todayâs Republicans ) , were with the South .The Federalists held together for the first few decades , but in 1803 the Louisiana Purchase â Jeffersonâs great coup â drove a wedge between the partyâs ideology and its demography . The national party was suddenly faced with a nation that looked very different from what it knew : in a stroke , a vast new territory would be opened for colonization , creating new economic and political interests , slavery among them .âThe people of the East can not reconcile their habits , views and interests with those of the South and West , â declared Thomas Pickering , a leading Massachusetts Federalist .Every Federalist in Congress save John Quincy Adams voted against the Louisiana Purchase . Adams , too , saw that New England , the cradle of the revolution , had become a small part of a new nation . Change âbeing found in nature , â he wrote stoically , â can not be resisted.âBut resist is precisely what the Federalists did . Fearing that Irish , English and German newcomers would vote for the Jeffersonian Republicans , they argued â unsuccessfully â for excluding immigrants from voting or holding office , and pushed to extend the period of naturalization from 5 to 14 years .Leading Federalists even plotted to âestablish a separate government in New England , â as William Plumer , a senator from New Hampshire , later conceded . ( The plot collapsed only when the proposed military leader , Aaron Burr , killed the proposed political guide , Alexander Hamilton . )The Federalists later drummed out Adams , who voted with the Jeffersonian Republicans to impose an embargo on England in retaliation for English harassment of American merchant ships and impressment of American sailors . This was the foreshadowing moment of the War of 1812 , which the Anglophile Federalists stoutly opposed .Finally , in the fall of 1814 , the Federalists convened the Hartford Convention to vote on whether to stay in or out of the Union . By then even the hotheads realized how little support they had , and the movement collapsed . And the Federalists , now scorned as an anti-national party , collapsed as well .Contrast that defiance with Jeffersonâs Republicans , who stood for decentralized government and the interests of yeoman farmers , primarily in the coastal South .They ruled the country from 1801 to 1825 , when they were unseated by Adams â who , after splitting with the Federalists , had joined with a breakaway Republican faction .In response , Jeffersonâs descendants , known as the Old Radicals , did exactly what the Federalists would not do : they joined up with the new Americans , many of them immigrants , who were settling the country opened up by the Louisiana Purchase .Their standard-bearer in 1828 , Andrew Jackson , favored tariffs and âinternal improvementsâ like roads and canals , the big-government programs of the day . The new party , known first as the Democratic-Republicans , and then simply as the Democrats , thrashed Adams that year . ( Adamsâs party , the National Republicans , gave way to the Whigs , which in turn evolved into the modern Republican Party . )Todayâs Republicans are not likely to disappear completely , like the Federalists did . But Republican leaders like Mr. Rubio and Mr. Graham understand that a party that seeks to defy demography , relying on white resentment toward a rising tide of nonwhite newcomers , dooms itself to permanent minority status . Opposing big government is squarely in the American grain ; trying to hold back the demographic tide is quixotic . Professional politicians do not want to become the party of a legacy class .The problem is that the Tea Party is not a party , and its members are quite prepared to ride their hobbyhorse into a dead end . And many Republicans , at least in the House , seem fully prepared to join them there , and may end up dragging the rest of the party with them .The example of those early days shows that American political parties once knew how to adapt to a changing reality . It is a lesson many seem to have forgotten .
ITHACA , N.Y. â SEVENTY-FIVE years ago today , President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Fair Labor Standards Act to give a policy backbone to his belief that goods that were not produced under ârudimentary standards of decencyâ should not be âallowed to pollute the channels of interstate trade . ''The act is the bedrock of modern employment law . It outlawed child labor , guaranteed a minimum wage , established the official length of the workweek at 40 hours , and required overtime pay for anything more . Capping the working week encouraged employers to hire more people rather than work the ones they had to exhaustion . All this came not from the magic of market equilibrium but from federal policy .For decades afterward , Congress brought more people under the lawâs purview and engaged in perennial struggles to maintain or increase the minimum wage . Fifty years ago this month , John F. Kennedy signed its most important amendment , the Equal Pay Act , which guaranteed women and others equal pay for equal work .Despite this noble history , today the act faces an uncertain future , thanks to a series of disconcerting shifts in the way we think about work in America .The problem is indicative of the moral and political slipperiness of our time . A large and growing number of employers willfully classify their employees as âexemptâ from the law by shifting their jobs , but not their pay , to administrative , executive and professional categories . Being exempt allows employers to ignore pesky things like overtime or minimum wages , since these are salaried , not hourly workers . Lawsuits over back overtime pay resulting from misclassifications have gone through the roof .If the line between exempt and nonexempt workers has become unfairly blurred , the line distinguishing employee and independent contractor has faded to near invisibility . We are moving toward the â1099 economy , â named after the tax form provided to independent contractors , a classification that often walks the line of legality .For some workers , being a 1099âer means more flexibility , creativity and control over their work . However , there are many more reluctant 1099 workers who want regular jobs but find themselves locked out of the system by employers looking for an easy way to buck their responsibility to their employees .And then there is the most infamous classification hustle : the internship . For bright , young ( and typically affluent ) interns at Americaâs top corporations there is no actual job , so there are no fair labor standards to apply . That means no minimum wage and no maximum hours . There is often no pay at all .A recent decision by the Federal District Court in Manhattan declaring that the hard-working âinternsâ involved in making the 2010 film âBlack Swanâ for Fox Searchlight were really employees is encouraging , and may well have long-range implications . Itâs a hopeful sign that we may yet be able to re-establish an idea that is as old-fashioned as it is good : work and you get paid .And yet , countercurrents persist . When Obamacare goes into effect next year , businesses that have more than 50 full-time employees will have to start offering health insurance . This could produce a scramble among small companies to reclassify enough employees so as not to have to pay for health insurance .In response , we need a new commitment from the federal government to buttress the Fair Labor Standards Act .More money for enforcement is a must . Compliance actions from the Department of Laborâs Division of Wages and Hours fell by over a third between 1997 and 2007 . This is partly a matter of resources : for this coming budget year , the Obama administration is seeking a modest increase of $ 15 million for enforcement of both the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Family Medical Leave Act . Thatâs not enough .There are several other ways to improve the act . Because its enforcement scheme relies on employees to come forward , rather than on government-initiated supervision through audits and worksite visits , protection against retaliation needs to be more robust . We can also improve the lawâs deterrence function , in the form of punitive damages for severe or pervasive violations .Itâs true that we are in the middle of a seismic shift in the way we structure our work lives . Both workers and employers want more flexibility . But that similarity of interests shouldnât mask the fact that employers will always have more power than their employees , and that itâs in their interests to make those employees work as long and as cheaply as possible .In Rooseveltâs day , the courts found most wages and hours legislation unconstitutional based on the doctrine of âliberty of contract.â The idea was as simple as it was pernicious : wages and hours legislation violated an individualâs freedom to make an independent ( read : worse ) deal with his employer .We canât afford to drift further back to the bad old days of liberty of contract . Americans are drastically overworked and underpaid compared to workers in other advanced countries , and our workers are trapped in a rigid pattern of inequality that has ended a historic claim to being the nation of upward mobility .Roosevelt did not bother with economic arguments when it came to hours and wages . He offered a simple framework , both moral and patriotic . âA self-supporting and self-respecting democracy , â he proclaimed , âcan plead no justification for the existence of child labor , no economic reason for chiseling workersâ wages or stretching workersâ hours.â That is as true today as it was then .
Kimberly Lantigua , 17 , is an avid reader , but of a somewhat unusual oeuvre . Not long ago she worked her way through novels that spawned movies starring Meryl Streep , one of her favorite actresses . “The Devil Wears Prada” was a breeze . “Sophie’s Choice” is Kimberly’s unsummited Everest .But for three weeks in July , she kept to a literary diet that focused on Plato , Aristotle , Thomas Hobbes and John Locke as she sat for several hours daily in a seminar at Columbia University titled “Freedom and Citizenship in Ancient , Modern and Contemporary Thought.”On the morning when I dropped by , she and 14 other high school students between their junior and senior years were listening to their professor , Roosevelt Montás , discuss Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s treatise on “the social contract” and the balance of rights between an individual and a community .Although the summer sun was shining like a cruel taunt outside the windows , the kids paid close attention , nodding and chiming in . There was no stealthy texting on smartphones . No fidgeting that I could see .At a time when a lot of the talk about diminished social mobility in America is just that — talk , lip service , a wringing of hands rather than a springing into action — this seminar represents a bold exception , worthy of applause and emulation .Most of the teenagers in the classroom with Kimberly — and most of another 15 in a separate section of the seminar — are minorities who were referred from the Double Discovery Center , a program in Upper Manhattan that couples undergraduate mentors from Columbia with New York City kids who hope to become the first in their families with college degrees .This was the seminar’s sixth consecutive summer and the first in which the number of students rose to 30 from 15 . The course intends to get them ready for higher education , and that isn’t unusual in and of itself . Many summer enrichment programs attempt as much .But the distinction of this one and the reason it should be replicated is that it doesn’t focus on narrow disciplines , discrete skills , standardized tests . It doesn’t reduce learning to metrics or cast college as a bridge to a predetermined career .It assumes that these kids , like any others , are hungry for big ideas . And it wagers that tugging them into sophisticated discussions will give them a fluency and confidence that could be the difference between merely getting to college and navigating it successfully , all the way to completion , which for poor kids is often the trickiest part of all .Montás also wants for these kids what he wants for every college student ( and what all of us should want for them as well ) . If the seminar is successful , he told me , they wind up seeing their place on a continuum that began millenniums ago , and they understand “their fundamental stake in our political debate.”“They read the news differently , ” he said . “They see themselves as political agents , able to participate.”So as he toggled over the span of the seminar from the French Revolution to Obamacare , he wasn’t just connecting dots for them . He was rooting them in our noble , troubled democracy , and trying to turn them into enlightened caretakers of it .For the course’s duration , thanks to funding from the Teagle Foundation and the Jack Miller Center , the kids live and eat free at Columbia . For Kimberly , who typically shares a two-bedroom apartment with her mother and five siblings , that was part of the lure . Another student , Mysterie Sylla , 17 , told me that her time on campus was a reprieve from stints in foster care .For every five kids in the seminar , there’s one teaching assistant , a Columbia undergraduate who will maintain contact with them over the next year and guide them through the college-application process . What a great model : Current college students who are blessed enough to be in the Ivy League extend a hand to would-be college students whose paths haven’t been easy .The kids who completed Montás’s seminar in the summer of 2013 are bound this fall for a range of schools including Syracuse , Brandeis and , in three cases , Columbia itself .Montás is the director of Columbia’s celebrated Core Curriculum , which requires freshmen and sophomores to dive into the Western canon . His summer seminar asks kids like Kimberly , who attends high school at the Manhattan Center for Science and Mathematics , to splash around in it .She was intimidated only briefly by the texts . “Once Professor Montás walks you through them , they’re approachable , ” she told me .The proof was in her participation . I heard her pipe up repeatedly : about the meaning of liberty , about necessary checks on what she called our “innate thirst for total power.” Her voice was clear and strong .I bet she wrestles Sophie to the ground soon enough . And I think that college could carry her far .
The true ideological inclinations of the Obama White House can be endlessly debated , but slightly more than halfway through this presidency I think it’s fair to make the following generalization : Obama has governed as a business-friendly social democrat and an aggressive social liberal , as a hawkish interventionist when intervention seems cheap and easy ( drones , missiles , etc . ) and a cautious realist when it doesn’t , and as a surprisingly vigorous defender of presidential prerogatives across a variety of fronts . A few weeks ago , I characterized Obama-era liberalism as featuring “an imperial presidency , a corporatist economic policy , and then a libertarian turn on almost every social issue , ” and while that line misses various nuances and complexities , as one-sentence summaries go I think it’s pretty good .It’s also useful for understanding why the last few weeks have been so rough for this White House . Obviously they’ve been difficult because scandal has piled on scandal : The resurfacing Benghazi affair , the news that the Internal Revenue Service took a disproportionate election-year interest in conservative activists , and now the revelation that the Department of Justice secretly seized two months worth of phone records for Associated Press reporters as part of a highly aggressive leak investigation . But it’s also because the details of the scandals raise uncomfortable questions about the particular policy synthesis that Obama has pursued — and they’re getting traction at a time when other high-profile stories , from the debate over the Oregon Medicaid study in wonkland to the trial of the late-term abortionist Kermit Gosnell over in culture-war territory , are raising similarly uncomfortably questions on other fronts .In the case of Benghazi , as Tim Carney points out , you have a story that’s ultimately about an administration trying to downplay the resilience of Al Qaeda and the messiness of post-intervention Libya , lest those realities sow election-year doubts about the success of the White House’s entire light-footprint , drones-and-bombs approach to counterterrorism and the Middle East . In the case of the I.R.S . and Justice Department imbroglios , you have two stories that don’t need to have direct links to the Oval Office to remind people of the kind of abuses that that imperial presidencies tend to generate . ( It’s also striking that both the new Benghazi revelations and the I.R.S./DoJ scandals came hard hard on the heels of Rand Paul’s filibuster , which was arguably the first moment when the Obama administration faced a significant political challenge on questions of executive overreach . )Meanwhile , whatever spin you put on the Oregon Medicaid study , it was a real-world test of the administration’s signature domestic policy initiative whose results clearly didn’t live up to liberal expectations , and it’s given skeptics of Obamacare perhaps their most statistically potent ammunition at a moment when the new health care law is about to face the test of implementation . ( Which , of course , involves new responsibilities for … the I.R.S . ) Likewise , while the implications of the Gosnell case are open for debate , it’s the first occasion in a while when social liberals have clearly been forced on the defensive — and the first high-profile story in Obama’s entire presidency to throw his own radicalism on abortion into sharp relief .Obviously his White House faced major challenges all across its contentious first term . But it was rare for the administration to see its attempt at a new left-of-center synthesis challenged and undercut across multiple fronts at once — on foreign policy and civil liberties and domestic policy and social issues . Journalists no doubt talk too much about narratives and storylines , but they do matter , and having all of these stories in the wind at once is significant , in part , because it threatens to rewrite the public’s understanding of what Obama-ism represents . The president wants to be seen , and works to be seen , as a pragmatic , data-driven steward of popular programs who’s leading a wave of social progress at home while keeping us as safe from terrorists as any Republican tough guy could . But the current mix of headlines suggests a very different take on the same record — in which Obama embodies a “new” progressivism that’s too comfortable with executive power and too eager to conduct foreign policy from 30,000 feet , too cozy with powerful interest groups and too wedded to a dysfunctional welfare state , and as far outside the mainstream on social issues as any of the right-wingers it likes to define itself against .Whether this alternative narrative actually takes hold with the public and press remains to be seen . But the last few weeks have clearly made it more credible , and an easier sell to the unconvinced , than all the slings and arrows of 2012 campaign .
2012 : I call it the year in “meh.” Not the worst we’ve ever experienced , but nothing particularly great to say about it either . Like being a socialite , but in Tampa .I am looking forward to 2013 , however , because I love the odd-numbered years — they’re the ones without congressional elections , Olympics , World Cups or weird extra days tacked onto the calendar by so-called scientists . Odd-numbered years are chill . They’re the 3 p.m. of years — that small sliver of time when lunch is digested and it’s too early to think about dinner and you stand at least a fighting chance of getting something done .In that spirit , here are the New Rules for the new year:NEW RULE Now that their end-of-the-world prophecy has proved to be complete baloney , the Mayans must be given a job predicting election results for Fox News .NEW RULE Sometime during the 2013 awards show season , “Gangnam Style” must be given an award for the shortest amount of time between my finding out what something is to my being completely sick of it . Besting the time of 7 hours , 12 minutes , set by “The Macarena” in 1996 .NEW RULE Congress must make it a tradition to drive off the fiscal cliff every year . And I mean really off the cliff , like Toonces the cat drove that car . This way Republicans can learn that lower military spending won’t lead to China invading . And Democrats can learn that no one cares what the Commerce Department does anyway .NEW RULE No more mixing politics with pizza . The filthy rich founder of Papa John’s , John Schnatter , said he’d cut his employees’ hours to avoid the costs of Obamacare . This is where I’d normally suggest boycotting Papa John’s , but that’s like telling people to boycott sadness . Nobody eats Papa John’s because they like it . They eat it because Domino’s won’t deliver to crack houses .NEW RULE The winners of next month’s Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show must later compete against the winners of “Toddlers & Tiaras” — so we can get their handlers in one place , lock the doors and let the kids and dogs run for their lives .NEW RULE The New Year’s Eve ball drop must be moved to one of the two states that recently legalized pot , so we can hear the crowd sing in unison , “Should old acquaintance be ... what are the words again ? ”NEW RULE Second-term Obama must have a few laughs by acting out the Tea Party’s worst fears . He must order Air Force One to fly everywhere upside-down like Denzel and replace Bo the White House dog with two pit bulls named “Malcolm” and “X.”NEW RULE Drugstores , supermarkets , department stores and all other retail establishments must stop asking me to join their “club.” A club is a place to have a few drinks .

A few weeks ago , New York Magazine’s Jonathan Chait wrote a post that cited the work of Reason Magazine’s Peter Suderman as an example of how libertarian and conservative journalists have spun a cocoon around their readers , making Obamacare’s doom seem perpetually inevitable even as the specifics of their doomsaying tell a story of its gradual success . “The message of every individual dispatch is a confident prediction of the hated enemy’s demise , ” Chait wrote of Suderman’s writing , “yet the terms described in each , taken together , tell the story of retreat.”To illustrate this point about “the substance , when viewed as a whole” of his fellow journalist’s analysis , he quoted four posts Suderman wrote during the winter of Obamacare’s discontent , most of which were day-after analysis of new enrollment numbers , and all of which noted ( accurately ) that the program was lagging its projected enrollment levels . Then he quoted a fifth post , from July , in which Suderman took issue ( again , reasonably ) with a new study claiming that Obamacare had cut the uninsured rate by 20 million . Thus , Chait concluded , readers of Suderman’s coverage “have gone from learning that the law has failed to cover anybody to learning it would cover a couple million to learning it would cover a few million to learning that it has probably insured fewer than 20 million people halfway through year one.”What was missing from this gloss , as Suderman noted in a slightly puzzled response , were any quotes from his writing in April , May and June , when he also covered Obamacare’s ( unexpected even to many of its supporters ) enrollment surge , and wrote posts explaining its implications for the uninsured rate ( and acknowledging some of his own more pessimistic hypotheticals no longer obtained ) . In other words , yes , a reader of Suderman’s work might have been more pessimistic about Obamacare than was warranted … but that same reader would have had an accurate real-time sense of where the enrollment numbers stood , while a reader of Chait’s take on Suderman would come away with the pretty clear ( and false ) implication that Suderman was a hack who only covered Obamacare’s numbers prior to its last-minute surge , and then simply dropped the subject before returning months later to attack new evidence of its success .I raise this recent example because it has some relevance to how Chait characterizes my coverage of Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign in his post today on Paul Ryan’s new poverty-and-mobility policy blueprint . Ordinarily , Chait’s piece would provide an excellent opportunity to resume our long-running , “Does Paul Ryan regard “The Fountainhead” as a blueprint for public policy ? ” debate , especially since he actually gives a little ground on that essential question . But unfortunately , that ground-giving is followed by this description of my own views on Romney’s campaign strategy and policy pitch:The difficulty of separating spin from substance is highlighted by Ross Douthat’s latest column expressing joy and relief that the Republican Party is , at last , abandoning plutocracy . In 2012 , Douthat concedes , Republicans ran openly as the party of the rich ( “job creators good , class warfare bad , you built that and now the 47 percent are living off your hard work” ) . Ryan’s new poverty agenda is the latest evidence that they are tailoring their agenda to “working class votes.”The trouble is that I lived through the 2012 election , and Douthat was insisting that Republicans were not the party of the rich then , too . In early 2012 , Douthat confidently asserted that Mitt Romney was “campaigning instead on a revenue-neutral tax reform and a modest tax cut for middle class investors , neither of which leaves him particularly vulnerable to the charge of “giving massive tax breaks to the rich.” Some of us pointed out that the math didn’t add up , and that the Romney-Ryan commitment to big tax rate cuts could not be reconciled with his more populist promises . No , no , Douthat insisted , the Romney platform amounted to “no net tax cut for the rich , tax relief for the middle class.”Douthat , with characteristically sharp hindsight analysis , now repeats the same shorthand description of Romney-Ryan that he dismissed at the time as desperate liberal smears . With characteristic optimism , he once again sees the Party moving boldly toward the center .So here we have two quotes from my election-year commentary , one from “early 2012 , ” the other undated . The early-2012 quote is from a post I wrote in the first week of January , when Romney’s position on taxes was indeed roughly as I described it ; the later quote is from the day after the first presidential debate , when Romney ( in the course of an unexpectedly effective debate performance ) did indeed promise “no net tax cut for the rich , tax relief for the middle class.” But Chait’s readers would have had a slightly clearer sense of my views had he quoted my post’s actual description of that on-stage promise . I called it a “pivot” away from Romney’s “foolish commitment to maximal rate reductions , ” a reference to something significant that happened in the eight months between between my January post and the first presidential debate : Namely , in the course of fending off his more conservative challengers , Romney committed himself to a more sweeping and specific rate reduction than he’d been campaigning on originally .Here is the column I wrote after he made that commitment : It is not , I think , favorable to Romney , and it concludes by warning that “the likely Republican nominee is suddenly headed for the kind of political and ideological cul-de-sac that losing presidential candidates often end up occupying.” Nor was that criticism isolated . I will certainly plead guilty to looking for reasons to be hopeful about Romney : We are not all as blessed as Jonathan Chait in having a political party whose current leader’s views accord so exactly with our own , and some of us have to oscillate between optimism and pessimism instead , rather than resting secure in the knowledge that whatever Barack Obama does next will be almost-perfectly correct . But even mixed with attempts to give him the benefit of the doubt , the idea that Romney wasn’t doing enough to reach out beyond his base — and that he could achieve such outreach with the kind of policy moves that I’ve praised when figures like Ryan and Marco Rubio and Mike Lee have made them lately — was a consistent theme in my writing throughout the long hot ’12 summer .See , for instance , this column on Romney’s missed opportunity to draw on his own faith’s communitarian tradition , or this post questioning the choice of Ryan as his running mate ( because it “doesn’t address Romney’s most glaring policy weakness … the ( understandable ) fear among hard-strapped voters that Republican policies will benefit the rich more than the middle class” ) , or this assessment of the state of play after the conventions ( which concluded by noting that “swing voters , and especially blue-collar swing voters , don’t just have reasons to distrust the Republican nominee personally ; they have reasons to distrust his party on policy as well” ) , or this early-autumn post on the theme of “What Bush Knew and Romney Didn’t” ( namely , that Republicans needed to explain why their policies would benefit “the middle class and the working poor , rather than just lionizing entrepreneurs and businessmen” ) , or this piece on what the “47 percent” fiasco says about the malign influence of the Republican donor class . ( What’s more , even when I was giving Romney’s outreach strategy a more positive spin it was usually hedged : “He isn’t targeting [ blue collar voters ] in ways that I would consider forward-looking or particularly inventive …” etc . )Did I start saying more favorable things about Romney’s approach after the first debate ? Yes , I did , because I felt that he had explicitly disavowed his least-plausible policy ideas that night , shifted somewhat closer to the arguments that I felt he should have been saying all along , and shown signs ( albeit perhaps “a little bit too late” ) of growing into the kind of leader the G.O.P . needed . And was I generally too optimistic about the Republican ticket’s chances in the waning weeks of the campaign ? Sure , and the next time we have a horse-race debate Chait can go ahead and ding me for it . ( This post on “Obama’s aura of defeat” is a good place to start . )But the claim that I spent 2012 dismissing as a “desperate liberal smear” the idea that Romney’s sales pitch offered more to the upper class than to the rest is extremely odd , given that I made that very criticism myself again and again and again . I don’t expect readers to read every word I’ve written ( perish the thought ) , but I do expect a frequent interlocutor like Chait , whose own work I try to give the attention it deserves , to at least acknowledge the major themes of my own commentary , rather than choosing two and only two examples to prove that I was always on board with what Team Romney was selling . Cherry-picking is the kind way of describing that kind of mischaracterization ; I can think of some harsher ones as well .
Mary White makes house calls . She’s a senior community health worker in Philadelphia in the IMPaCT program at the Penn Center for Community Health Workers . She has 25 of the University of Pennsylvania Health System’s toughest patients . It’s her job to help them set health goals and , step by step , carry them out .One of her patients is Grover Wilson , an engaging man of 56 who weighs 515 pounds . Wilson had long been athletic and sociable , the organizer of a long-running community volleyball game . But depression and an injury led him to gain weight . Now he lives in a tiny basement apartment packed floor to ceiling with boxes of his possessions , and is trapped and isolated by his weight .White has been visiting Wilson for three months . He’s lost 15 pounds during that time , with the help of a group class at the Penn Center and her visits . “How are you doing on your goal to cut down on sugary drinks ? ” she asks . What about your snacks ? “I’ve finished all my hummus and pretzels , ” he says . “I’m going to get some baby carrots , and more hummus , and pita chips.”“That’s good , that’s good , ” White says . “They’re having a sale on hummus.”They talk about his exercise goal : walking up and down his hallway . “As usual , I’m not doing a great job on my own , ” he said . “It’s very easy when you’re alone and obese and have sleep apnea and other problems to say , ‘I just want to give up.’ Depression comes and goes . But today’s a good day.” He means because White is visiting .“You’ll do it . I took half a person off me , ” White says — she accompanies another patient to the gym , and she’s lost 50 pounds so far . “My knees are feeling better . You’ll do it . Be around positive people.”They talk about his other problems . He’s on a payment plan with the power company , worried about his next payment . “But then I got my S.S.I . rebate , ” he says . “Now I can pay my bills.”“I’m so happy ! ” White beams : “Why didn’t you tell me ? ”Wilson squeezes her hand . “You don’t get half , you know , ” he says , smiling .In 2010 , researchers from Penn began interviewing patients who lived in high-poverty neighborhoods about what they saw as barriers that kept them from getting health care , and kept them sick . Those responses — from long interviews with 115 patients — became the basis of the Penn Center and IMPaCT , which stands for “individualized management for patient-centered targets.”The center’s community health workers , or C.H.W.s — seven now , but there will be 30 next year — visit some of Penn Medicine’s poorest and sickest patients : people who live in high-poverty neighborhoods , are hospitalized or have two chronic diseases , and either have Medicaid or no insurance at all . Since they began seeing patients in 2011 , they’ve treated 1,800 of them . They expect to work with that number every year starting in 2015 .Many poor countries use C.H.W.s on an enormous scale — in rural areas , where doctors and nurses are scarce , a C.H.W . often serves as the doctor . In the United States , their role is different . White and her colleagues have no medical training . ( Before this , she was a family health worker with the Supportive Child Adult Network . ) They’re chosen for their ability to listen , support and encourage , without judgment . They are people from the same communities as their patients , and often with the same struggles . They help patients with the many factors keeping them sick that aren’t typical doctor problems .This is a crucial role in a country where vast numbers of people are sick with chronic lifestyle-related diseases . Doctors can’t help patients change their behavior in the 15 minutes they spend with each patient . But community health workers can .Yet C.H.W.s are few in the United States . Some “promotora” programs employ them in Native American and Latino communities , especially with migrant workers . A few states make them a part of health care — and Obamacare will increase that number .“Every so often you see a foundation sink a lot of money into community health worker programs , ” said Prabhjot Singh , a Columbia professor and doctor in East Harlem who is co-chair of the One Million Community Health Workers Campaign . “The DNA of a lot of these programs comes from an activist , almost anti-bottom-line perspective . They are grant funded , and there’s a lot of academic interest but there is not a way to systematically invest in C.H.W.s.” So even though many studies — this is a good compilation ( pdf ) — show they improve health and save money , these programs rarely last very long or grow .The Penn Center was founded by Shreya Kangovi , an internist and pediatrician who is an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School . Before she and her colleagues designed the IMPaCT program , they reviewed other C.H.W . programs to see why they didn’t last .They found several common problems . Most important , C.H.W.s were rarely integrated into a health care system’s processes or its financing . “They were often all by themselves , in a church basement , ” Kangovi said . “If they were doing great work , no one knew about it and no one paid for it.” Many programs vanished when their grant money disappeared .There were also staffing problems — lots of turnover , lots of workers who weren’t right for the job . Organizations didn’t understand what kinds of skills they needed and how to identify the people who had them . Many C.H.W . programs were disease-specific — but a lot of patients have multiple serious illnesses . And the work wasn’t standardized : Few programs had manuals , for example . Each new worker was re-inventing the job .Kangovi and her colleagues tried to attack these problems systematically . They decided that C.H.W.s wouldn’t limit their scope , but help patients with any health goal . They made hiring decisions and designed a manual and formal training based on the barriers to care cited by the patients . They aimed to have a plug-and-play model that other hospitals could use .It is still early , but there are some good signs . Staff turnover has been zero . The researchers tracked the impact of having a C.H.W . visit patients at hospital discharge and for two weeks after . Patients who got the visits saw a doctor sooner , had better mental health and were less likely to later have multiple readmissions than patients in a control group . ( The program had no effect on patients’ physical health or medication adherence — not unexpected given such a brief intervention , ) The long-term home visits the C.H.W.s do now are aimed at improving patients’ chronic diseases . The center is halfway through a long study looking at that .The Penn Center is one of several new models hospitals are trying to make C.H.W . programs sustainable . ( There’s a whole other way of doing this , too — programs run by community organizations , paid for largely by cities or states . ) Another is Grand-Aides . Unlike the Penn C.H.W.s , Grand-Aides don’t help with social or logistical issues . They are nurse extenders who get hundreds of hours of medical training . Each patient visit is supervised in real time by phone by a nurse , who makes all the decisions . A pilot at two pediatric Medicaid sites in Texas showed that the program cut readmissions by at least two-thirds .Arthur Garson Jr. , who directs the Health Policy Institute of the Texas Medical Center in Houston and founded Grand-Aides , believes that C.H.W . programs have stayed small because most don’t certify their workers . His program requires each Grand-Aide to pass a test for certification every year . It’s a way of standardizing the work and building confidence with hospitals . “Hospitals want to know they are competent and tested yearly , ” he said . Currently 14 hospitals in the United States use Grand-Aides — Garson says the program will be in 40 hospitals by spring 2015 .Do hospitals make money from C.H.W . programs ? Some believe they do . Garry L. Scheib , the chief operating officer of the University of Pennsylvania Health System , said that Penn had a financial as well as a medical interest in putting the C.H.W . program in its budget and tripling its size .“The real economic benefit for us is the open beds it creates , ” he said . “I usually have a waiting list for inpatient beds.” Hospitals profit most by filling those beds with patients who need complex , specialty surgeries and care — especially when they carry private insurance . IMPaCT patients , by contrast , often need routine care , or non-medical help . They carry Medicaid ( which brings in little revenue ) or are uninsured ( a total loss ) . Hospitals must accept these patients , so keeping them as healthy as possible — preferably outside the hospital — is good .Scheib said IMPaCT also saves Penn money because its staffers are a low-wage way ( their pay starts at $ 14 an hour ) to stretch and complement doctors and nurses who are paid a lot more .But Singh warns that only a minority of hospitals are solvent enough to see things the way Penn does . “Most have huge reservations about bringing on yet another work force , along with care managers and care coordinators . And providers don’t really have great incentives to reach out to Medicare and Medicaid patients that are hard to reach . If these patients don’t come to an appointment , well , that’s just how it goes . Maybe the hospital’s internal quality indicators go down a little — but it doesn’t warrant pounding the pavement to find these people.”Given the rarity of C.H.W . programs , this is obviously how many hospitals think . The emergency room is still a profit center for many hospitals , as long as patients have some insurance .Hospitals are also resistant because C.H.W . programs lie outside their core competency . “If it’s community health workers or nurses , they’ll always go with nurses . It’s easier — even if there’s a sizeable population nurses are unable to reach , ” said Heidi Behforouz , an associate physician in the global health equity division at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston . ( She ran Partners In Health’s PACT program , perhaps the most renowned C.H.W . program in the United States . Even that program didn’t survive the loss of charitable funding – it was transferred to another organization , in much diminished form . ) “Not a lot of places have glommed on to ‘Yes , we need the community health worker model.’ ”Obamacare is changing this calculus . Medicare now bases a small part of its reimbursement to hospitals on measures of quality , including readmissions — which gives hospitals an incentive to help patients stay healthy . In a major shift for C.H.W.s , the federal government this year permitted state Medicaid funds to pay for their work , as long as it was initially recommended by a doctor or other licensed practitioner .But the biggest change initiated by the Affordable Care Act is a gradual shift away from fee-for-service medicine to rewarding quality , not quantity . With that shift , hospitals and payers will be looking for what Singh calls “the lightweight infrastructure that takes care of people outside of the hospital.”“If fee-for-service disappears , there is more emphasis on prevention , wellness and quality of life in the long term , ” said Behforouz , “Then everybody would be pushing for community-based models that kept people at home.”Join Fixes on Facebook and follow updates on twitter.com/nytimesfixes .

I encourage you to read “Facing the Climate Crisis without Hysteria , ” the latest Huffington Post piece by Steven A. Cohen , who is the executive director of Columbia University’s Earth Institute and whose career , including long stints at the Environmental Protection Agency , has given him an excellent vantage point on the mix of regulation , motivation , prosperity and innovation that drives environmental progress .The piece appropriately decries caricatured , baseless attacks on climate science by conservative ideologues and those seeking to delay a shift away from fossil fuels . But Cohen also criticizes climate campaigners and some in the media for responding with oversimplified predictions of environmental doom . Here’s an excerpt and link , with some more background on Cohen:I think the questioning of science by the American right wing and the political assaults funded by their rich benefactors are proving to be a distraction to those interested in moving the planet to a path of sustainable economic growth . It is turning analysts into advocates and advocates into hysterics . The IPCC report focused a great deal of attention on solutions , but the media accounts of the report focused on the possibility of food shortages . Here we go again : Chicken Little’s sky is falling in . Climate and ecological impacts are creating deep problems in agriculture . While there is no question that these are real problems , as in the past these will likely be addressed by new technologies and new techniques that will overcome the problems we now face .The glass is either half empty or half full . I choose to believe it is half full . The history of the technological age we are in is that technology both creates unforeseen problems and then sets about solving them . My bet is on human ingenuity . Maybe the U.S. federal government was not capable of building a website to handle the traffic generated by the Obamacare deadline , but Amazon’s website copes pretty well with the massive traffic it generates in the days before Christmas . Maybe we can’t stop the sea waters from rising , but we can place our utility rooms on the second floor instead of the basement . As for agriculture and the food supply , it is always a bad idea to bet against the technology of food production .I suspect we will survive , because we are not suicidal .He goes on to make a vital point about the down sides of an overemphasis on technological solutions ( a theme I touched on a few years ago ) :How far down the road to an all-technological world have we travelled and how far do we want to go ? Think about the holographic recreational facilities on the science fiction spacecraft in Star Trek . What if that was all we had left and , in our carelessness , had destroyed our home planet ?The issue we face is not our survival , but our willingness to accept the final triumph of technology at the expense of the planet we are biologically and emotionally connected to .Here’s the link to the full post . This echoes the cautionary views of the Harvard biologist Edward O. Wilson , as well .Like many , I’m sure , I’ve been much more familiar with the climate and energy policy preferences of Jeffrey Sachs , the institute’s director . The best recent representation of Sachs’s views is the paper he and others co-authored with James E. Hansen , the longtime NASA climate scientist who now has a climate policy position at Columbia , in which they build on Hansen’s longstanding call for a rising price on carbon .To capture the full scope of thinking on this question , I think it’s important to consider Cohen’s ideas , too .He stated flatly at a recent meeting on climate science and policy at the University of California , Santa Cruz , that the primacy of energy demands in developing countries will prevent a carbon price from working to cut the carbon from global energy menus any time soon . “This will not happen through a carbon tax or anything that increases the price of energy , ” Cohen said . “The developing world sees what we have here… . If we don’t leapfrog we’re in deep trouble.” He went on to stress the importance of government policies that can drive the development and dissemination of low-carbon energy technologies .Here’s a recent talk Cohen gave on approaching sustainable human development as a management problem ( the core of the talk begins at 4 minutes , 30 seconds ) :You can follow Sachs and Cohen on Twitter here : @ JeffDSachs @ StevenACohen .
Jonathan Gruber is mad as hell , and he’s not going to take it anymore . The eminent health care economist and health reform architect is annoyed at Casey Mulligan’s latest , which misrepresents Gruber’s views ; mine too .Gruber is right to be mad : that was a disgraceful , deceptive column . But I think you also want to put it into a larger picture : the enduring myth of the stupid progressive economist .So about Mulligan : As Gruber documents , he pulls multiple fast ones , asserting things that he says are conclusions of the CBO report when they aren’t — they’re his own views , pulled out of , um , thin air , or maybe someplace else , which he is projecting onto the budget office to make them seem authoritative .Beyond that , Mulligan tells his readers that both Gruber and I are too dumb or craven to admit that the disincentives to work created by some aspects of the Affordable Care Act impose economic costs . One suspects that Mulligan didn’t actually read either of the pieces he links to . If he had , he would have found this from Gruber:But the likelihood of voluntary reductions in work is not the only issue . The CBO also projects work reduction by individuals who cut back on hours or avoid moving up the job ladder because they don’t want to lose Medicaid eligibility , or because they don’t want to make so much in wages that they would lose tax credits to help pay insurance premiums . Unlike voluntary job leaving , this second kind of work reduction would entail real economic distortions and be a cost , not a benefit .And this from me:Just to be clear , the predicted long-run fall in working hours isn’t entirely a good thing . Workers who choose to spend more time with their families will gain , but they’ll also impose some burden on the rest of society , for example , by paying less in payroll and income taxes . So there is some cost to Obamacare over and above the insurance subsidies . Any attempt to do the math , however , suggests that we’re talking about fairly minor costs , not the “devastating effects” Mr. Cantor asserted in his next post on Twitter .So both of us acknowledge that there are incentive effects and that they have a cost ; but both of us argue on quantitative grounds that the cost isn’t large . Hardly the doctrinaire liberalism Mulligan thinks he sees .Oh , and bonus misrepresentation : Mulligan:Paul Krugman goes even further and calls it “misrepresentations” to interpret the marginal tax rate provisions of the Affordable Care Act as destructive .No , I didn’t — I called talk about “2 million jobs destroyed” a misrepresentation , because it is . Who says so ? The CBO itself .On to the broader point . What one sees in this particular Mulligan piece is something I encounter all the time , in many contexts : the myth of the stupid progressive economist .It works like this : Conservatives in general , and conservative economists in particular , often have a very narrow vision of what economics is all about — namely supply , demand , and incentives . Anything that interferes with the sacred functioning of markets or reduces the incentive to produce must be a bad thing ; any time a progressive economist supports policies that don’t fit neatly into this orthodoxy , it must be because he doesn’t understand Econ 101 . And conservative economists are so sure of this that they can’t be bothered to actually read what the progressives write — at the first hint of deviation from laissez-faire , they stop paying attention and begin debating with the stupid progressive in their mind , not the real economist out there .As a result , many conservatives seem utterly unable to take on board the notion that people like Jon Gruber or yours truly might understand Econ 101 , but also believe with good reason that you need to go beyond that point .On the health care issue : yes , there are incentive effects — as there are with all insurance , by the way . But there’s also good reason to believe that there’s a major market imperfection in the form of job lock , and that even aside from this , there are important benefits to expanding health insurance that must be weighed against any costs . All of that is , in brief , in both of the pieces Mulligan denounces , and there at much greater length in our other writings ; but as so often happens , conservatives develop problems of reading comprehension whenever such issues come up .I’ve encountered similar responses on many other issues . You say that deficit spending is helpful in a depressed economy ? You must be saying that deficits and bigger government are always good , which is stupid hahaha . You say that increasing unemployment benefits in a demand-constrained economy can create jobs ? But you also said once upon a time that unemployment insurance can raise the natural rate of unemployment , so you’re stupid hahaha .Well , somebody’s being stupid , anyway .I can’t resist going back to the 2009 debate over stimulus , when one after another , prominent conservative economists dismissed calls for a temporary increase in spending as being clearly stupid and/or corrupt , because accounting identities , or maybe the effect of expected future taxes , clearly showed that stimulus made no sense . Along the way these notables reinvented classic conceptual errors from 80 years ago and added a few new howlers too ; yet their faith in the proposition that progressive economists must be idiots never wavered .But then John Stuart Mill knew all about this .
In the wake of the Times Magazine’s profile this weekend of les reformocons , both Jonathan Chait and Danny Vinik have noted what Chait calls the “near-total absence” of Paul Ryan’s name from a story that concerns itself with the kind of wonkery that has long defined the House Budget Chairman’s brand . Chait suggests that this reflects a shift away “from Ryan-style apocalypticism” on fiscal issues among right-of-center policy entrepreneurs . Vinik , meanwhile , argues that a split between Ryan and reform conservatives over taxes might be in the offing , since the former veep nominee is more likely to side with a WSJ-style “always cut the top rate” vision than with proponents of something like Mike Lee’s family-friendly approach .I think both writers raise useful points , but also possibly exaggerate the discontinuity between Ryanism and the reformist tendency . Chait and I have gone so many rounds on the True Nature of Paul Ryan over the years that I don’t think it’s worth re-litigating those issues ; I’ll just say that from the point of view of conservative reformers , the Ryan who matters ( and yes , like all politicians he contains multitudes ) has always been the Ryan who did more than any other Obama-era politician to save the G.O.P . from policy unseriousness ( and often tried to do still more ) , rather than a Randian Ryan or an apocalyptic Ryan or any other interpretation of his record Chait prefers . And in this sense , many aspects of Ryanism are pretty clearly foundational for reformers : The wisdom of his basic vision for Medicare reform is taken for granted by most people in our camp ( and , happily , by most prominent Republicans ) , his 2009 alternative to Obamacare , which failed to win over the party at the time , looks a lot like the health care alternative proposed in the recent Room to Grow compendium , and the broad goal of his famous budgets — reforming the welfare state in order to keep the federal government’s share of the economy within its post-World War II bounds — is a broad reformocon goal as well .That said , reformers ( well , this one , at least , but I think most of us ) tend to differ from the Ryan budget’s vision on two important fronts . First , its projected cuts to discretionary spending and Medicaid look implausibly sweeping , and as a result — to quote from my very first column on the Ryan blueprint — “too much of the budget’s austerity is borne by downscale Americans , ” without any of the compensating efforts aimed at shoring up the working class’s socioeconomic position that many reformers consider essential to our project . Second , and relatedly , the Ryan sketch ( and in fairness , it is just a sketch ) of tax reform seems to strongly prioritize top-rate reductions , and reformocons tend to prefer tax plans that include elements ( a child tax credit , a payroll tax cut , or at the very least — as in Dave Camp’s plan — just a larger tax cut for median-income households ) aimed much more squarely at raising the average worker’s take-home pay .Now without claiming special knowledge , my sense is that Ryan himself might accept some of the merits of the first critique , and that his budget’s implausible discretionary cuts were mostly driven by the political imperative to 1 ) meet the House conservative demand for a balanced budget as soon as humanly possible ( in ten … no , five years ! ) without 2 ) including any kind of Social Security overhaul . While there isn’t ( yet ) a Ryan blueprint specifically focused on safety-net reform , if you look at some of his post-2012 forays on the issue , you can see the outline ( in this op-ed , for instance ) of a more plausible approach , in which the focus is on reshaping anti-poverty programs rather than just slashing them to achieve unlikely spending targets .On the second front , though , I think ( having made a similar argument myself in the past ) that Vinik’s probably correct to see Ryan as more of a traditional supply-sider on taxes — which is not surprising , given his intellectual influences — than a potential partisan of a family-friendly tax reform . ( One could add , as well , that he’s also a WSJ-style immigration dove and monetary hawk , both positions that put him somewhat at odds with , for instance , Ramesh Ponnuru and Reihan Salam , among other reformist writers . ) So if and when there is a Ryan tax reform proposal , I wouldn’t be surprised to see some critiques from the reformocon camp , and if there were ever a Ryan presidential run those kind of disagreements might loom larger . Or — who knows ? — perhaps the recent debate between Kim Strassel and Ponnuru will be recapitulated some day in a behind-the-scenes policy argument between a Ways and Means chairman Ryan and a President Rubio or Lee …But that’s getting a long way ahead of ourselves . For now , I would say that the differences between reform conservatism and Ryanism are more implicit than definite , and to the extent that they might come to matter in the future , they would represent a far , far more fruitful variety of intra-conservative disagreement than most of the G.O.P.’s Obama-era civil wars .
WASHINGTON — MORE than two million people have signed up for health insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act , a tribute to the effectiveness of the “tech surge” the Obama administration deployed to overcome the highly publicized problems with HealthCare.gov that emerged in October . The website’s initial rollout will long stand as a monument to how badly technology contracting can go wrong . But the remarkable recovery also demonstrates what a determined response to such bungling can achieve .Sadly , food stamp and Medicaid recipients can only look on in envy . Just as disaster-relief agencies keep track of hurricanes , floods and earthquakes , students of anti-poverty programs remember a litany of automation and contracting meltdowns — some of them prolonged , even epic . Florida , 1992-93 . Michigan , 1998-99 . Colorado , 1998-2002 . Texas , 2006-7 . Indiana , 2007-9 . The Colorado Benefits Management System is particularly memorable : When first implemented , it reportedly refused food stamps to anyone who did not have a driver’s license from Guam .But finding parallels to the HealthCare.gov meltdown requires no memory at all . Just as HealthCare.gov was filling the headlines , a contractor for the Georgia Department of Human Services was neglecting to send renewal notices to the homes of some 66,000 food stamp recipients and about half that number of Medicaid beneficiaries . On Nov. 1 , the state’s computer system — which goes by the Orwellian acronym Success — automatically terminated benefits to all those affected for failure to cooperate with reviews they had never been told were underway .In December , a Massachusetts contractor sent thousands of people new electronic food stamp benefit cards and immediately deactivated their old cards — without waiting to see if the new ones had arrived in the mail . Many had not . In mid-October , a contractor’s glitch made food stamps inaccessible to recipients in 17 states .The White House showed impressive alacrity in fixing HealthCare.gov . But its response to technology failures affecting low-income people has been far more sluggish . The federal Department of Health and Human Services did eventually direct Georgia to reactivate the Medicaid benefits for those wrongfully terminated . The federal Department of Agriculture ( which administers food stamps , now known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program ) brushed aside repeated pleas to tell Georgia to reinstate food assistance in time for Thanksgiving .Instead , Georgia told its desperate people to reapply through a website , though it operated only intermittently . Wrongfully terminated households could call to request paper applications — but the call center answered fewer than 30 percent of the calls it received in September , and the lucky few who did get through had average waiting times of 34 minutes . They could go into a local food stamp office — but once there , they would only be directed to a terminal to try to get on the website or a phone to try to get through to the call center . Not just Orwell , but Kafka and Dickens come to mind .Nor was this latest failure an isolated episode . In July 2012 , a group of Atlanta eligibility workers told the federal Agriculture Department that case managers were “falsely documenting” that they were calling customers and “getting no answer” and using that excuse to justify denial of food-stamp assistance .The Agriculture Department did not investigate these whistle-blowers’ complaints . When my name appeared in an Atlanta news article about the food stamp debacle , a state employee called me to report a backlog of 12,000 applications waiting to be entered into the Success database .All of this reflects a broader double standard for automation and contracting — and for government administration generally . An Indiana state judge described a familiar pattern in an earlier food stamp and Medicaid automation contracting fiasco : Officials implemented a “supersized” contract , an “untested theoretical experiment , ” that resulted in irremediable “personal suffering of needy Hoosiers.”A few years ago , a former federal official , frustrated at frequent indifference to low-income Medicaid beneficiaries , joked darkly that the two big government health insurance programs should be called “Med-I-Care” and “Med-I-Don’t-Care.” ( Elderly Medicare users are politically far more important than the poor and disabled customers of Medicaid . )Properly supervised contractors can use technology to improve the delivery of government services . But attention , oversight and willingness to act decisively to remedy fiascoes seem to depend on the wealth and clout of those who are affected . As Obamacare regains its footing , that lesson shouldn’t be forgotten .
Hillary Clinton of all people knows how political fortunes turn on a dime . But she must be puzzled nonetheless , and spooked , that over a six-month period when she made no big news whatsoever , her popularity took a double-digit tumble .A poll released last week by NBC News and The Wall Street Journal charted the decline . It found that the percentage of Americans who view her favorably had dropped to 46 from 56 . The percentage with unfavorable views had risen , less strikingly , to 33 from 29 .Here we go . The beginning of the end of her inevitability .Itâs about time , because the truth , more apparent with each day , is that she has serious problems as a potential 2016 presidential contender , and the premature cheerleading of Chuck Schumer and other Democrats wonât change that .In the wake of the federal shutdown , in the midst of the Obamacare meltdown , voter disgust with business as usual is at the kind of peak that ensures more than the usual share of surprises in the next few elections . In one recent poll , 60 percent of Americans said that theyâd like to see everyone in Congress , including their own representatives , replaced ; in another , a similar majority hankered for a third party .These unusually big numbers suggest a climate in which someone who has been front and center in politics for nearly a quarter-century wonât make all that many hearts beat all that much faster . Voters are souring on familiar political operators , especially those in , or associated with , Washington . Thatâs why Clinton has fallen . Sheâs lumped together with President Obama , with congressional leaders , with the whole reviled lot of them .And some of the ways in which she stands out from the lot arenât flattering . She comes with a more tangled political history of gifts bestowed , favors owed , ironclad allegiances and ancient feuds than almost any possible competitor does . Weâve had frequent reminders of that : in the Anthony Weiner saga ; in reports of mismanagement at the Clinton Foundation ; in coverage of Terry McAuliffeâs bid to become Virginiaâs governor .Weâve also had glimpses of the Clintons as an entrenched , entitled ruling class . To a degree that has turned off even some of the coupleâs loyalists , Bill and Hillary have been unabashed lately in their coronation of Chelsea as the Clinton in waiting , the heir to the throne .They renamed the familyâs foundation to give her billing equal to theirs , with Hillary telling New York magazine that Chelseaâs elevation was âin the DNA.â They tug Chelsea onto pedestal after pedestal , tucking her into the folds of their own glory .And it works . In an interview in September , Piers Morgan asked Bill Clinton whether Hillary or Chelsea would make the better president .âOver the long run , Chelsea , â Bill said . âShe knows more than we do about everything.âSuch dynastic musings square oddly with whatâs shaping up as an anti-establishment passage of American politics , and the Clintonsâ overexposure is a dicey fit for the revved-up metabolism of the Twitter era , which wants next , more , new .Hillaryâs shot at shattering the ultimate glass ceiling , an overdue milestone , might be newness enough . But would she be spared a potentially disruptive challenger from the left in the Democratic primaries ? The ascent of Bill de Blasio and the cult fervor for Elizabeth Warren demonstrate an appetite right now for liberal firebrands .And what would the argument for a Hillary presidency be ? Something interesting happens when you ask Democrats why her in 2016 . They say that itâs time for a woman , that sheâll raise oodles of dough , that other potentially strong candidates wonât dare take her on . The answers are about the process more than the person or any vision she has for the country . Thereâs no poetry in them . Thatâs not good .âCompetence , â said one prominent Democratic strategist , articulating Hillaryâs promise . âAnd by the end of Obamaâs second term , that may be more than enough.âShe sailed high as secretary of state because , apart from Benghazi , she could and did position herself mostly above the partisan fray . The hellcat had become a cool cat , wearing shades instead of thick glasses , the meme of all memes .But nine months since she left that job , itâs hard to pinpoint what , other than all those dutiful miles she logged , her legacy is . She has returned to her earth , and itâs a fickle place .One of the widely circulated nuggets from the just-published book âDouble Down : Game Change 2012â is that Obamaâs advisers considered knocking Joe Biden off the ticket and putting Hillary on . The anecdote has been cast as an insult to Biden .But he remained , because internal research apparently suggested that Obama wouldnât get a meaningful bump from the swap .What does that say about Hillary ?
TORONTO â For democracies to work , politicians need to respect the difference between an enemy and an adversary .An adversary is someone you want to defeat . An enemy is someone you have to destroy . With adversaries , compromise is honorable : Todayâs adversary could be tomorrowâs ally . With enemies , on the other hand , compromise is appeasement .Between adversaries , trust is possible . They will beat you if they can , but they will accept the verdict of a fair fight . This , and a willingness to play by the rules , is what good-faith democracy demands .Between enemies , trust is impossible . They do not play by the rules ( or if they do , only as a means to an end ) and if they win , they will try to rewrite the rules , so that they can never be beaten again .Adversaries can easily turn into enemies . If majority parties never let minority parties come away with half a loaf , the losers are bound to conclude they can only win through the utter destruction of the majority .Once adversaries think of democracy as a zero-sum game , the next step is to conceive of politics as war : no quarter given , no prisoners taken , no mercy shown .For a long time now , the language used by both sides in American politics has been inflamed by bellicose metaphors . Elected officials âtear intoâ their opponents , âtake the fightâ to their opponent and engage â as we see clearly now , in the third week of the federal government shutdown â in the tactical equivalent of trench warfare . Where language leads , conduct follows .The problem is that politics is not war , but the only reliable alternative to it . Once we think of politics as war , battle cries drown out democratic persuasion . By slow degrees , belligerence and self-righteousness make cooperation impossible .There can not be much doubt that , in the impasse over the shutdown in Washington , and in the possibility of a default on the federal debt , we are seeing what happens when a politics of enemies supplants a politics of adversaries .Anyone who has lived in a dysfunctional or struggling democracy knows that a politics of enmity can end in rule by presidential decree , or even in political violence . Americans consider such scenarios unthinkable . Yet even if the standoff over the debt ceiling ends in a deal , it will already have exacted a brutal price . Extremists will come away believing that hostage-taking might work next time . When blackmail becomes standard practice , democracy is pulled a step closer to permanent paralysis .Some experts believe that the enmity mind-set simply reflects real divisions in the society at large . Inequalities in income , wealth and opportunity have soared , the argument goes , making it impossible for ordinary Americans to respect each other as adversaries .Other thoughtful observers argue â I think convincingly â that while factions at either end of the political spectrum do see each other as enemies , most Americans are actually not as divided as their politics makes them seem . The real problem , in this account , is the political system : districts drawn so that incumbents never face the challenge of reaching out beyond their own base ; primary systems that reward extremist activists over moderate pragmatists ; campaign finance rules that allow big , opaque donations by wealthy interests .From this perspective , the politicians arenât so much reflecting the divisions in American society as they are exacerbating them , from the top down .The tendency is to magnify differences of policy into differences of conviction . For example , Republican and Democrat voters alike are ever more dependent on government programs like Social Security and Medicare , but you would never know this from the way Tea Party Republicans describe Obamacare as an assault on freedom .Politicians ratchet up manageable differences of policy into conflicts over identity and value . In this way , what Freud called the ânarcissism of minor differencesâ drives party activists into closed worlds of discourse , while leaving the rest of Americans feeling that âthe systemâ fails to serve them at all . They cease participating altogether , leaving the politicians to brawl in a deserted public square .Besides magnifying differences , the politics of enmity makes competition viscerally personal . The object is not to rebut what people say , but to deny them the right to be heard at all . Attack ads that deny standing have been a feature of American politics from Lyndon B. Johnsonâs depiction of Barry M. Goldwater as mentally unstable menace to the âswift boatingâ of John F. Kerry . The politics of personal destruction have come to seem normal , even acceptable .More civility and gentility â being nicer â will not cure this . What needs to change are the institutions themselves , and they will only change when the political class in Washington realizes that , just as in American football , there are some hits that are killing the game .Saving the game means changing the rules . Until quite recently Americans believed their democracy was so exceptional that they had nothing to learn from other countries . Now , real dysfunction may make them look more carefully at how other democracies avoid gridlock . Britain , France and Germany , as well as Canada and Australia , have impartial districting commissions that prevent gerrymandering and force incumbents to reach out rather than play solely to their base . They have campaign finance rules that prevent rich cranks from funding rabid partisanship . They have rules to prevent politicians from grandstanding abuse of process in their legislatures . They have open primaries that prevent electoral capture by fanatics . If Americans still feel that other countriesâ democratic practices have nothing to teach them , they can learn from reform at the state and local level .Whatâs indefensible is a political class that believes nothing better is possible â a class that benefits from enmity without realizing that the damage from it is corrosive , and possibly irreversible .Michael Ignatieff , a former leader of the Liberal Party of Canada , is the author , most recently , of âFire and Ashes : Success and Failure in Politics.âINTERNATIONAL NEW YORK TIMES
Warren , Conn .WHEN I was asked to direct “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest , ” my friends warned me not to go anywhere near it .The story is so American , they argued , that I , an immigrant fresh off the boat , could not do it justice . They were surprised when I explained why I wanted to make the film . To me it was not just literature but real life , the life I lived in Czechoslovakia from my birth in 1932 until 1968 . The Communist Party was my Nurse Ratched , telling me what I could and could not do ; what I was or was not allowed to say ; where I was and was not allowed to go ; even who I was and was not .Now , years later , I hear the word “socialist” being tossed around by the likes of Rick Perry , Newt Gingrich , Rick Santorum , Sean Hannity , Rush Limbaugh and others . President Obama , they warn , is a socialist . The critics cry , “Obamacare is socialism ! ” They falsely equate Western European-style socialism , and its government provision of social insurance and health care , with Marxist-Leninist totalitarianism . It offends me , and cheapens the experience of millions who lived , and continue to live , under brutal forms of socialism .My sister-in-law’s father , Jan Kunasek , lived in Czechoslovakia all his life . He was a middle-class man who ran a tiny inn in a tiny village . One winter night in 1972 , during a blizzard , a man , soaked to the bone , awakened him at 2 in the morning . The man looked destitute and , while asking for shelter , couldn’t stop cursing the Communists . Taking pity , the elderly Mr. Kunasek put him up for the night .A couple of hours later , Mr. Kunasek was awakened again , this time by three plainclothes policemen . He was arrested , accused of sheltering a terrorist and sentenced to several years of hard labor in uranium mines . The state seized his property . When he was finally released , ill and penniless , he died within a few weeks . Years later we learned that the night visitor had been working for the police . According to the Communists , Mr. Kunasek was a class enemy and deserved to be punished .I found myself in an equally absurd , but less depressing , situation when I was moonlighting on Czech TV as a moderator , introducing movies , in the early ’50s . It was live , so there was no chance to bleep politically undesirable words . Every utterance , even in supposedly spontaneous interviews , had to be scripted , approved by the censors , learned by heart and repeated verbatim on the air .When I was preparing to interview one Comrade Homola , a powerful Communist , I sent him questions , but didn’t receive his answers . My boss , also a powerful party member , told me : “He is lazy ! Write his answers for him , and remind him to learn them by heart.” So I did .Comrade Homola arrived at the last moment . When the red light went on and I asked the first question , he reached into his pocket , took out my answers and started to read them , awkwardly and obediently — including my inadvertent grammatical mistakes . And thus , to my consternation , went the whole interview . In the control booth , my boss hit the roof . I was fired the next day for ridiculing a representative of the state .Whatever his faults , I don’t see much of a socialist in Mr. Obama or , thankfully , signs of that system in this great nation . Mr. Obama is accused of trying to expand the reach of government — into health care , financial regulation , the auto industry and so on . It’s fair to question whether the federal government should have expanded powers : America , to its credit , has debated this since its birth . But let’s be clear about how frightening socialism actually could be .Marx believed that we could wipe out social inequities and Lenin tested those ideas on the Soviet Union . It was his dream to create a classless society . But reality set in , as it always does . And the results were devastating . Blood flowed through Russia’s streets . The Soviet elite usurped all privileges ; sycophants were allowed some and the plebes none . The entire Eastern bloc , including Czechoslovakia , followed miserably .I’m not sure Americans today appreciate quite how predatory socialism was . It was not — as Mr. Obama’s detractors suggest — merely a government so centralized and bloated that it hobbled private enterprise : it was a spoils system that killed off everything , all in the name of “social justice.”What we need is not to strive for a perfect social justice — which never existed and never will — but for social harmony . Harmony in music is , by its nature , exhilarating and soothing . In an orchestra , the different players and instruments perform together , in support of an overall melody .Today , our democracy , a miraculous gathering of diverse players , desperately needs such unity . If all participants play fair and strive for the common good , we can achieve a harmony that eluded the doctrinaire socialist projects . But if just one section , or even one player , is out of tune , the music will disintegrate into cacophony .I am not asking Mr. Obama and the Republican leaders to stop playing instruments of their choosing . All I am asking is that every player keep in mind the noble melody of our country . Otherwise the noisy dissonance might become loud enough to wake another Marx , or even worse .
WashingtonTHE latest budget proposal by Representative Paul D. Ryan , called âThe Path to Prosperity , â is anything but . It fails to seriously address runaway government spending , the most pressing problem facing our nation . I can not vote for something that would trick the American people into thinking that Congress is fixing Washingtonâs spending problem , when in actuality weâd just be allowing it to continue without end .Supporters of the âPath to Prosperity , â including many of my fellow Republicans , say that we have to stop spending money we donât have , an idea I promote every chance I get . But under the proposal by Mr. Ryan of Wisconsin , the chairman of the House Budget Committee , the federal government would continue to spend more than it will this year .Spending would grow by an average of 3.4 percent annually , only slightly less than the rate under President Obamaâs plan , which is 5 percent a year . After 10 years â Mr. Ryanâs target for eliminating the deficit â the âPath to Prosperityâ will have spent $ 41 trillion , when the presidentâs plan would allow spending of $ 46 trillion . My partyâs de facto position has become âweâre increasing spending , but not as much as the other guy.â Thatâs not good enough .Just reducing growth in spending does almost nothing . We have to dig deeper and make profound cuts now . We can not continue to assume that future Congresses will do our dirty work for us .We ought to get rid of certain federal departments and agencies , stopping only to shift the role of governing back to the states , where it belongs . The Departments of Education and Energy , for example , are two bloated bureaucracies that we donât need ; their core functions would be absorbed by the states through block grants , saving taxpayers at least $ 500 billion over the next decade .Constitutionally speaking , the federal government should not have a role in K-12 public education anyway . Overpaid Washington bureaucrats shouldnât be deciding how to provide for teachers and students , whose own state and local governments are better equipped to understand their needs . A Heritage Foundation study showed that in 2010 , the average salary of an Education Department employee reached $ 103,000 â nearly double the average public-school teacherâs salary . Letâs phase out a large portion of the departmentâs roughly $ 70 billion budget . We can transfer the remaining dollars directly to the states , where they will be used more wisely .Letâs also abolish the Energy Department , which is one of the biggest federal culprits responsible for the mismanagement of taxpayer dollars . Without unending government backing , the Energy Department would have ceased to exist long ago because of its ineffectiveness , corruption and poor investment strategy . Taxpayers are now on the hook for hundreds of millions of squandered dollars because of failed federal loans given to green companies like Solyndra and Fisker Automotive .The only constitutionally necessary service provided by the Energy Department is regulation of the nationâs stockpile of atomic weapons , a function that can return to the Department of Defense . Eliminating this bureaucracy would be a large , permanent spending cut , and restore energy-related venture capitalism to its natural home , the private sector .Our spending crisis is so severe that we canât stop at these two departments â there are more areas to cut . For example , we should also phase out the federal highway financing system and allow states to keep their own gas tax receipts . States would then be free to determine their own transportation needs and explore creative funding for roads like public-private partnerships .As a family doctor for more than 30 years , I understand that we must look for savings in our health care system too . I recently co-sponsored legislation that would convert Medicaid and the Childrenâs Health Insurance Program into state-managed programs through a single federal block grant . This would save approximately $ 2 trillion over 10 years by capping federal funding at 2012 levels for the next 10 years and giving states an incentive to seek out and eliminate waste , fraud and abuse . The government agency closest to the consumer can most efficiently manage taxpayer dollars .Weâre not done . We must repeal Obamacare â including the associated taxes , which the Ryan budget leaves intact by assuming the enactment of tax reform later on . Weâll replace it with a market-based health care system devoid of government involvement and managed by patients and their doctors , a plan I have described in my Patient Option Act .If we get government out of the way and put Medicare in patientsâ hands by increasing contribution limits to health savings accounts , it will transform Medicare into a more flexible premium assistance program .To cap all this off â literally â I have proposed a balanced-budget amendment that would force Congress to stick to the principle of not spending more than we take in . Passing a constitutional amendment is no easy task . While itâs a large undertaking , Iâll continue to fight for its passage . Just a few weeks ago , the House put enough pressure on the Senate to force it to produce a budget â something Senator Harry Reid of Nevada , the Democratic majority leader , hadnât attempted in over four years . If we keep up the pressure , weâll continue to see results .Rather than nibbling around the edges as the Ryan proposal does , we must do all of this and much more now . There is a âPath to Prosperity , â but Mr. Ryanâs budget isnât it . The only way to protect our nationâs financial future as well as our citizensâ liberty is to stop the outrageous spending in Washington and permanently reduce the size of our overreaching federal government .
HANOVER , N.H. â A COUPLE of months ago , JAMA Internal Medicine , a journal of the American Medical Association , published the findings of a brief online survey of middle-aged Americans.Most had previously been screened for either breast or prostate cancer . But the study found that about half said they would not choose to start screening if the test resulted in more than one overtreated person per one cancer death averted .Wow . That implies that millions of Americans might choose not to be screened if they knew the whole story â that overtreatment is typically more common than avoiding a cancer death .Is the survey right ? Honestly , I have no idea . Different surveys get different answers . According to surveys , most of us hate Obamacare . But a number of us like the Affordable Care Act ( another name for the same thing ) . And most of us like the bulk of the individual components of the law . How you ask the question matters .Similarly , how Americans feel about screening is obviously related to what they are told about screening . Most of the time they get a simple message : Itâs the most important thing they can do to stay healthy . Occasionally , they may hear just the opposite : Itâs dangerous . The truth is , itâs neither .Instead , itâs a close call . Different people in the same situation can rationally make different choices . But first , patients need some quantification of the benefits and harms .In a study to be published Monday , Dec. 30 in JAMA Internal Medicine , a colleague and I attempt to provide that data for women making the choice about screening mammography . Letâs be clear at the outset : There is a lot of uncertainty â and professional disagreement â about what the data are . So we provide a range of estimates , from optimistic to pessimistic .There is no doubt that screening mammography in the United States leads to a lot of false alarms . Among a thousand 50-year-old American women screened annually for a decade , how many will have at least one false alarm ? Our estimate ranges from 490 to 670 . The data come from the mammographers themselves â the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium â and reflect radiologists who deliver low and high rates of false alarms ( those in the 25th and 75th percentiles ) .A screening program that falsely alarms about half the population is outrageous . To be sure , many women are quickly reassured by a second test that their breast is normal . But others â while told they donât have cancer â are told that their breast is somehow abnormal , that they have dysplasia or atypia , that they are at âhigh risk.â Whether you blame the doctors or the system or the malpractice lawyers , itâs a problem that needs to be fixed .Then there is the problem of overdiagnosis : the detection of a âcancerâ that was not destined to ever cause problems . Overdiagnosis is what leads to overtreatment . A decade ago doctors debated whether this problem existed in breast cancer . Now the debate is about how often it occurs .In a pamphlet to help women decide about mammography screening in Britain , the National Health Service now explicitly tells women that their chance of overdiagnosis is about three times higher than their chance of avoiding a breast-cancer death . I canât tell you if that is the right estimate ; since most everyone who receives a diagnosis of âcancerâ is treated , overdiagnosis is rarely observed directly , so it is notoriously difficult to quantify . But I can tell you itâs in the ballpark . Our optimistic/pessimistic finding is this : Among a thousand 50-year-old American women screened annually for a decade , 3 to 14 will be overdiagnosed and overtreated .What about the benefit ? Among those thousand women , 3.2 to 0.3 will avoid a breast-cancer death . If you donât like decimals , call it 3 to 0 .The optimistic estimate reflects the most favorable result of the nine most comprehensive randomized trials of breast cancer screening . But these trials were initiated 20 to 50 years ago . Whether their results are still relevant is a question . Because of substantial improvements in breast cancer treatment , many cancers that would have been deadly 20 years ago now no longer are . The better we are able to treat cancer , the less important it is find it early ; in other words , there are fewer deaths for screening to help avoid . This is what is reflected in the pessimistic estimate . One study comparing regions with similar populations and health care systems , but different screening policies ( like Sweden versus Norway and Northern Ireland versus the Republic of Ireland ) , found that breast cancer death rates had declined at similar rates , regardless of when mass screening was adopted .So put it all together . Among a thousand 50-year-old American women screened annually for a decade , 3.2 to 0.3 will avoid a breast cancer death , 490 to 670 will have at least one false alarm and 3 to 14 will be overdiagnosed and treated needlessly . That may help some women choose whether to be screened or not . But itâs still not very precise , and it doesnât answer the fundamental question : Now that treatment is so much better , how much benefit does screening actually provide ? What we need is a clinical trial in the current treatment era .Two randomized trials could begin to answer the central question of mammography interpretation : How hard should the radiologist look ? Women who view mammography favorably might be willing to be screened under either the current approach or a high-threshold approach â meaning their radiologist would ignore small , likely harmless abnormalities found on a mammogram.Those who view it less favorably might choose that high-threshold approach ( knowing that the harms of false alarms and overdiagnosis would be minimized ) or forgo mammography completely .Putting the two trials together , we could finally learn what level of screening minimizes false alarms and overdiagnosis while saving the most lives . Most experts would say that itâs never going to happen . It would cost too much , take too long and need too many subjects .Maybe they are right . But maybe not . Sure , it would cost millions of dollars . But thatâs chicken feed compared with the billions of dollars we spend on breast cancer screening every year . Sure , it would take 10 to 15 years . But it would help our daughters know more . Sure , it would take tens of thousands of women to participate . But maybe they would want to be part of the effort to help sort out the morass surrounding what is one of the most common medical interventions done to American women .You never know , until you ask .None of this should dissuade women from seeking a diagnosis when they develop a new breast lump ( thatâs a form of early diagnosis we all agree on ) or from seeking treatment for a diagnosed breast cancer ( better treatment , not early detection , is the real success story in breast cancer ) . The uncertainties are about screening . Women who want to reduce those uncertainties will have to participate in trials .
So … I am aware that having the Republican House Majority Leader defeated by a no-name insurgent tends to cut against my ongoing argument , hotly contested by Jonathan Chait and others on the left , that the Democrats should be worried about their coalition holding together in the next presidential cycle . But because I’m stubborn , I’m going to celebrate Cantorgeddon by going one more round on the subject of whether President Obama’s approval ratings should be a cause of concern for his party , by responding to my colleague Nate Cohn’s contention that for now , at least , they shouldn’t be .In particular , Cohn argues that we should probably expect modern presidents to struggle to maintain solid approval ratings outside of presidential election years , and that liberals need not be too troubled by Obama’s current slump:… Mr. Obama’s lower approval ratings … might just reflect the difficulty of maintaining election-year levels of support from Democratic-leaning voters , and the difficulty of earning crossover support in an increasingly polarized era .No president has averaged 90-plus-percent approval ratings among his partisans throughout his term , even though about 90 percent of partisans usually vote for their party in presidential elections . Bill Clinton , for instance , averaged an 84 percent approval rating among Democrats in Gallup’s polls in 1997 … That’s only a tick higher than Mr. Obama’s 80 percent approval rating among Democrats in Gallup surveys so far this year … Nonetheless , Mr. Clinton earned significantly higher general approval ratings than Mr. Obama because he earned considerable crossover support , including from about 30 percent of Republicans . Mr. Obama’s opposition has been extremely unified . That makes it difficult for Mr. Obama to earn overall approval ratings at or above 50 percent .So Mr. Obama’s approval ratings don’t necessarily mean that he has lost an unusual amount of support where it matters . Mr. Obama might well be retaining the approval of a healthy percentage of his supporters from 2012 , with his approval ratings deceptively low because of nearly unanimous Republican opposition .It’s hard to find evidence suggesting that Mr. Obama’s weakness stems from a deeper problem , like alienating some portion of Democratic-leaning voters .Cohn is quite right that polarization has put a pretty hard ceiling on Obama’s potential support . But the president has faced “nearly unanimous Republican opposition” for almost his entire presidency , so while that opposition explains why he can’t get to Reaganesque approval ratings , it doesn’t really explain his post-2009 ups and downs , up to and including his long post-2012 swoon . And I do think there’s evidence that this swoon reflects a deeper problem than just a lack of enthusiasm among loyal Democrats — that it is , in fact , possibly hitting the party “where it matters.”For instance : The president’s job approval ratings , while lower since 2012 among Democratic partisans , have also fallen sharply among independent voters , substantially more of whom now rate his performance unfavorably than did so during his previous , first-term approval-rating lows . This pattern is not entirely dispositive , of course , because the category of self-described independents changes with political circumstances , and many people who fall into it are really partisan leaners who almost always vote G.O.P . or Democratic . ( This is part of why Kerry and Romney both won the “independent” vote without winning the presidency . ) But Obama’s current struggles with this group still suggest that his approval-rating problem isn’t exclusively a matter of undermotivated Democrats who will eventually fall into line for his successor ; it’s also a sign , at least potentially , that he’s lost the confidence of at least some voters who are more weakly attached to his coalition , and whose votes that coalition needs .As further suggestive evidence on this score , I would submit the following recent polling from Pew:Obama’s current approval measure is much higher than George W. Bush’s at this point in the 2006 midterm , and Obama is less of a drag on his party’s midterm prospects than Bush was …Yet the public’s desire for a change from the president’s policies is almost as widespread as it was during Bush’s second term . [ emphasis mine — R.D . ] Thinking about the next presidential election , 65 % would like to see the next president offer different policies and programs from the Obama administration while 30 % want Obama’s successor to offer similar policies . In April 2006 , 70 % wanted the next president to have policies different from Bush ; 23 % wanted similar policies . By contrast , in June 1999 , at a later point in the Clinton administration , just half wanted the next president to pursue different policies .And to the point , raised by Chait in our back-and-forth , that the G.O.P.’s unpopularity is necessarily the Democratic Party’s saving grace , these Pew numbers seem worth highlighting:… Despite weak job ratings for Republican leaders , the public is divided over whether their economic policies or Obama’s would do more to strengthen the economy over the next few years . About four-in-ten ( 43 % ) think Republican leaders’ policies would do more for the economy while about the same share ( 39 % ) says Obama’s policies would be more effective .Then just to add a further data point , since Chait seems confident that the president’s numbers are trending upward now that Obamacare has stabilized : This week’s Bloomberg poll , taken after the Bergdahl and V.A . controversies , has Obama’s approval rating at 43/53 , the lowest number of his presidency in that survey . And I would also note that if you can tear your eyes away from Cantor’s dégringolade , you’ll notice another headline today that may soon have some implications for the public’s judgment on this president’s stewardship …… which will not , I freely concede , translate into a rejection of his party if the Republicans ultimately can not get their act together . So far it’s true , as Cohn points out further on in his piece , there aren’t a lot of indications in the midterm polling that the G.O.P . is currently making the most of the opportunities created by the public’s discontent . And it’s also possible that the aftermath of last night’s primary upset will create a new downward spiral for Republicans , a new doom loop of intransigence and folly , that would leave the party ill-equipped to make the most of the country’s apparent desire for a post-Obama change .Those are an excellent reason for Democrats not to panic — and again , with Hillary in the wings , I don’t think they should . But they aren’t reasons for them to be unworried in the face of evidence that their underlying advantage for 2016 is distinctly fragile , and that clear opportunities to shatter it exist .
Because it’s tax day , because he mentions me and because I’m easily provoked , below the quote you’ll find three rejoinders to Jonathan Cohn’s admirably forthright argument that American society would be much better off if most of us were writing larger considerably larger checks to Uncle Sam:Maybe you don’t like tax day … [ because ] it reminds you of how high taxes are—and you think that , because of those high taxes , the economy grows more slowly . That would mean fewer jobs and less pay for you—and the country as a whole . It’s not a crazy argument … But the evidence for this point of view turns out to be thinner than you’ve probably heard . Relative to other countries , tax rates in the U.S. are relatively low , even when you throw in local and state taxes and add them to federal levies . Overall , according to the Tax Policy Center and Center on Budget and Policy Priorities … taxes in the U.S. are among the lowest in the developed world . The average for countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development , an organization of rich countries , is higher . And in countries like Sweden , Norway , and the Netherlands countries , the average is much higher . In those nations , taxes account for more than half of total national income .That level may sound scary but , as many of us have written before , you could make a good case that the people of Scandinavia and Northern Europe know what they are doing . They are far more secure , thanks not only to national health insurance but also to generous provision of child care and unemployment benefits . And despite the high tax burden , their economies have historically been strong—in part , because the combination of investment and a secure safety net makes people more comfortable with a dynamic , ever-changing economy . The wonks used to call this economic model “flexicurity.”As conservatives like New York Times columnist Ross Douthat note , you can’t simply import that model to the U.S. wholesale . But the Scandinavian experience is one reason that many economists and policy experts think there’s room for U.S. taxes to rise … .1 ) It’s true that the U.S. has a lower tax burden than most developed countries . It’s also the case that the U.S. is much , much richer than most developed countries , in ways that a casual trip to Paris or London or Stockholm can sometimes obscure . The I.M.F.’s numbers have our purchasing-power-adjusted per capita G.D.P . at $ 53,101 , which is slightly lower than oil-rich Norway ( and Luxembourg ) but more than $ 10,000 higher than Sweden and more than $ 15,000 higher than Denmark ; most of the rich European economies are clumped together between the mid-thirties ( where you’ll find the French ) and the low forties ( where you’ll find the Germans ) . Now : This wealth gap doesn’t necessarily prove anything about the link between low taxes and growth , since the U.S. has basically always been richer and ( as Cohn notes ) many of the social democracies have grown at a very respectable rate , in per capita terms , over the last few generations . But if you flashed back to the 1970s , you would find a number of very smart people who expected northern Europe ( and Japan ) to achieve more than respectable growth , and do more than just keep up with U.S. growth : They expected , for plausible theoretical reasons , that we would see continued convergence between the American economy and its developed-world competitors . And that , to put it mildly , did not happen ; instead , post-Reagan , the social democracies actually slipped back a bit . So without claiming anything dispositive , I would be much more cautious than Cohn about the claim that growth and tax rates are unrelated , and much , much more hesitant about treating major tax increases as basically a free lunch .2 ) And speaking of that free lunch … it’s also quite possible that the European economic story would look rather different , and rather less impressive , if American political economy had always looked more Swedish or French , and hadn’t pursued growth and innovation at quite the same frantic , Anglo-Saxon pace . This is , again , a highly contentious topic , but there’s a certain plausibility to the idea that ( in the language of Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson ) the developed world’s different tax-and-transfer models are actually complementary “flavors , ” and that in a world where rich economies all converged on a single “cuddly” model of capitalism everyone — poor Scandinavians as well as rich Americans — would , on a long time horizon , eventually end up worse off . ( Here it’s also worth pointing that if these complementarities and spillover effects do exist , the sheer size of the U.S. economy means that “Europeanizing” our tax-and-transfer model would represent a much more high-stakes roll of the global-economic dice than the kind of “bringing a lone outlier closer to the norm” scenario that country-by-country comparisons sometimes evoke . )3 ) Then on what you might call the question of implementation , Cohn concedes the very general point that we can’t simply impose Swedish structures on the United States and call it a day , but he doesn’t address the more specific problem suggested by that concession : Namely , that a lot of liberal proposals essentially ask us to assume that American government — the quasi-imperial government of a vast , diverse , immigrant-heavy continent of three hundred million people — can somehow , in some future dispensation , approach the efficiency of welfare states administered on a much smaller scale and for a much more homogenous population . Which is to say , they wave away one of the central problem with existing public outlays in the U.S. , which in other contexts they’re happy to highlight — the absence , in core areas like health care and education , of a clear link between increased spending and better outcomes . Or else they acknowledge the link , but assert that the best way to reform our kludgeocracy is to pursue greater efficiency in program design while simultaneously pouring more money into the system overall — using a heaping-full of sugar to make the medicine go down , if you will . ( This was the basic theory of Obamacare , and also of more bipartisan reforms like No Child Left Behind . ) It isn’t a crazy theory , but I think it’s reasonable to worry that in a system as inefficient and cross-pressured as ours , the sugar simply offsets or counteracts the medicine’s effects . And that possibility makes a strong case for holding the tax burden constant while seeking de-kludge-ification , rather than pre-emptively handing more money to bureaucracies and programs that aren’t exactly being managed with Nordic efficiency , and aren’t showing the most impressive of results .*To the foregoing I’d add one further , non-rebutting point : Namely , that regardless of whether one prefers Scandinavian-style social democracy to a lower-tax , more laissez-faire-ish mixed economy on moral grounds , the case for higher taxes gets stronger to the extent that the U.S. model doesn’t seem to be working on its own terms . By this I mean that all systems involve trade-offs , and our model is no different : American-style capitalism promises higher living standards overall in exchange for higher individual risks ; faster growth rates in exchange for greater inequality ; lower unemployment rates in exchange for fewer workplace protections ; more liberty for innovators and entrepreneurs in exchange for somewhat less solidarity-as-redistribution . But if this promise isn’t being fulfilled , as has been the case in the last decade — if only the rich are seeing income gains , if the pace of growth and innovation are slowing even as inequality gets wider , if workforce participation is actually dropping below the European norm — then it’s inevitable that the model itself will start to bleed support . So at least part of the left-right divide at the moment ( visible in the Picketty discussion , the guaranteed-income vogue , and the like ) is over whether we should accept this breakdown , this failure of the American promise , as a permanent feature of our political economy — in which case the argument for high taxes does look stronger , because there’s less to lose — or whether we should still be making policy on the assumption that while the 2000s may have been a lost decade for the American dream , a revival of our model’s advantages is still a real , worth-desiring possibility .
IF the government shutdown has shown us anything , itâs that the 80 or so House Republicans driving the crisis have emerged as the most unified force in politics : tightly organized , highly disciplined and ideologically firm .But wasnât their plan to make the budget a vehicle for defunding President Obamaâs health care legislation doomed from the start ? And even if this small band has the backing of voters in their safely drawn âredâ districts , as well as Tea Party support , havenât their unyielding tactics antagonized a majority of the public ?In fact , this minority faction â the âsuicide caucus , â as the conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer has called it â may be less shortsighted and self-defeating than it appears . At a time when so many officials in both parties still invoke the virtues of compromise and perpetuate the ideal of common ground on which âconservative pragmatistsâ can meet âmoderate Democrats , â these more combative Republicans may be in the vanguard of a new post-consensus politics .Consider the warnings of many , including some in the conservative establishment , that the shutdown will rebound against the party . As evidence they cite theÂ shutdown of 1995 . The winner then was President Bill Clinton , who deftly used the episode to right his wobbly presidency and then coasted to a second term in 1996 .But Ted Cruz , the Texas senator who helped set the stage for the conflict , has offered a different interpretation . Those prophesying ruin âneed to go back and read their history books a little more closelyâ regarding 1995 , he said on Laura Ingrahamâs radio show in July . âIn the next election , 1996 , Republicans held on to the majority in the House , the first time Republicans had done that since 1930 , in 66 years , â Mr. Cruz pointed out . âWe lost a total of nine seats in the House . In the Senate , we gained two seats.âMr. Cruz , in other words , was calculating the odds of success in terms of the Congressional , rather than presidential , outcome . This makes sense , since he was born in 1970 and came of age in the years when his party struggled to build national majorities ( winning the popular vote only once in the six presidential elections held from 1992 to 2012 ) and instead flexed its muscles through the legislature .Changing demographics would seem to weaken the appeal of anti-government figures like Mr. Cruz ( who was born in Canada and is of Cuban ancestry ) . That is why traditional conservatives like the columnist Michael Gerson insist that âpragmatic Republicansâ are the partyâs salvation , and that Mr. Cruz and his allies are mounting a ârevolt against reality.âBut as America becomes more diverse , another population has come more clearly into view : the alienated and disenchanted . These people have embraced a libertarian and anti-government outlook and have little use for what they see as the compromised , impure âbig governmentâ conservatism of the Reagan and Bush years .To this constituency , the Republican who will go as far as he can â taking one last crack at undoing Mr. Obamaâs health care reform or voting later this month not to raise the debt ceiling â is not an obstructionist but a politician of principle , a rebel with a cause .âThe business of the opposition is to oppose , â as Robert A. Taft , the Republican senator who led the attempt to slow down New Deal programs , once said .Recent victories that Republicans have won , for instance on gun control , have come not through compromise but by out-organizing and outspending their opponents . The hallowed idea of consensus , and the dream of building a majority , has given way to a survival strategy .The most striking example of Republican opposition is the revival of the doctrine of statesâ rights , historically associated with slavery and Jim Crow . There are unmistakable overtones of this past in the anti-Obamacare movement in some of the 26 states , especially in the Deep South , that have rejected the Medicaid expansion .
As an interlude between “reform conservatism and …” posts , I want to return to the Mark Lilla essay on our present political situation that I commented on a couple of weeks ago , this time to quibble a little bit with its title . That title is “The Truth About Our Libertarian Age , ” and most writers I’ve seen commenting on the essay — from my colleague David Brooks to Andrew Sullivan to Damon Linker — have tended to basically accept Lilla’s formulation , which links the spread of cultural individualism ( defined as “an outlook with treats as axiomatic the primacy of individual self-determination over traditional social ties” ) to the durable triumph of neoliberalism in political economy , and places both under the umbrella of a libertarianism ascendant .Now I would not dispute that ours is , in certain ways , a libertarian moment and age . But the label does not completely fit the phenomena that Lilla — in what is , to reiterate , a truly rich essay — is trying to grasp and wrestle to the mat . Consider , for instance , his description of the European Union’s internal contradictions:Since the 1980s , the European Union’s project of economic integration has been governed by neoliberalism , a powerful form of contemporary libertarianism . There were concrete reasons for this , having to do with certain failures of the welfare state and the sluggishness of economies held down by state-run enterprises , over-regulation , and powerful unions . But as time passed the reasons were forgotten and neoliberalism became what it is today : a dogma that obscures its real-world effects , which are not just economic .It is shocking , for instance , to see how slow Europeans have been to recognize how seriously the EU neoliberal approach to economic integration jeopardizes the principles of democratic self-government that were recovered after World War II … The result is that ordinary Europeans today do not know what to make of the “European project.”They see that the weighty decisions are made in the Brussels bureaucracy or in the European Commission , whose members are not directly elected . The European Parliament is elected , but there are no pan-European parties to offer comprehensive programs for governing and suffer the consequences if they fail to enact them . … As for constructing European identity , one need only point out , as many have done , that the euro note shows not a single historical figure or place or monument that might resonate with citizens from Glasgow to Taormina , and that few are aware of the anthem that the EU has chosen for them . ( It is “Ode to Joy , ” ironically enough . ) Not only has massive immigration shaken Europeans’ national sense of “we , ” so has the continual expansion of the EU borders to the east and southeast and , who knows , perhaps one day to the southern rim of the Mediterranean …It is little wonder that citizens today in both weak and strong nations feel duped and distrust each other . As Greece and other nations have teetered on the edge of insolvency and the EU has demanded austerity , their citizens have rightly sensed that they are losing control over their collective destinies . But this is also true of the restless German public , which worries that it has signed an economic suicide pact with profligates . Nationally elected officials in the weaker states , hoping to stay in office while having to impose austerity , point to the Germans ; the Germans shift blame to the EU solvency rules . The EU then points to the omniscient financial markets , which refer you to American bond-rating agencies , which are staffed by MBAs working in cubicles who have become , faute de mieux , the new sovereigns of Europe . And what they demand is less democracy and more reliance on technical governments and economic experts …I agree with a great deal of this portrait … except the suggestion that “neoliberalism” and “libertarianism” are the only deep forces at work here . First , Lilla’s language seems to imply that “the sluggishness of economies held down by state-run enterprises , over-regulation , and powerful unions” belongs to Europe’s past , which is perhaps not quite accurate in every case — and that inaccuracy , and the persistence of Eurostatism it effaces , should cast some doubt on the idea that neoliberal or libertarian ideas are the only dogma that matters on the contemporary continent .Then , further , look at how Lilla himself describes the restructuring of power in modern Europe : “Ordinary Europeans today do not know what to make of the ‘European project’ … weighty decisions are made in the Brussels bureaucracy or in the European Commission … [ there is ] more reliance on technical governments and economic experts.” What he’s describing is a bureaucratic power grab , the machinations of a managerial elite , the rule of regulators , the growth of the administrative state … and while these forces are compatible with neoliberal economic policies and socio-cultural permissiveness , they are not remotely libertarian in nature themselves ; indeed , their power strictly precludes many limitations on government’s size and scope , and encourages centralization and consolidation of power in many spheres instead .And what’s true of the E.U.’s development is also true in other areas of contemporary Western life , where the patterns Lilla describes , plausibly , as “libertarian” coexist with other trends that represent something else , or maybe somethings else . Think of the post-9/11 growth of the national security state ( which advanced , yes , in part through “neoliberal” means like government contracting ) ; think of the expansive war-on-terror powers the last two administrations have claimed ; think of the militarization of local police forces and the only-recently-reversed expansion of mass incarceration ; think of the consistently ( if sometimes confusingly ) corporatist element in our economic policy under governments of the right and left alike ; think of the easily-observable expansions of legal and administrative oversight in almost every walk of life . Then think of what you might call the panoptical aspect of modern society — the vanishing ( or willing surrender ) of privacy in the online realm , the wealth of personal information that we’ve placed at the fingertips of analysts in Silicon Valley and N.S.A . headquarters alike , the increasing clout of both official bodies and unofficial coteries ( from soi-disant “human rights commissions” to Twitter mobs ) intent on policing and punishing deviations from right thinking and … I could go on , but I think readers will recognize the realities I’m describing .There is , of course , also strong resistance to many of these trends . ( The N.S.A.’s powers are contested and John Yoo is widely reviled ; causes like prison reform and copyright reform both have footholds in our politics ; the Canadian speech police ultimately saw their case against Mark Steyn dismissed ; Hobby Lobby won its case against the Departmant of Health and Human Services , etc. ) . But such resistance is just that — a pushing back , as yet only intermittently successful , against the growing power of certain institutions ( public and private ) and cultural arbiters over non-conforming individuals and communities . And the overall mix of centralization and forced-conformism that’s made this pushing-back seem necessary simply doesn’t fit all that comfortably with the description of ours as an essentially/exclusively libertarian age .Which is why I keep returning to James Poulos’s evocative phrase “the pink police state” in these kind of conversations , because it gets at the friendly amendment that I’d make to Lilla’s thesis : He’s describing two pillars of our present regime , cultural permissiveness and neoliberal economics , but there’s arguably a third pillar that’s more managerial and centralizing and ultimately collectivist , and that’s just as crucial to the underlying architecture . This pillar’s necessary existence is hinted at in his essay — as when Lilla says of our society that “the only freedom we are losing is the freedom to choose our freedoms” and notes that even in a hyper-individualistic culture we aren’t “now all free to do as we wish ( since wishes inevitably conflict ) .” But I don’t think he goes far enough in recognizing how large this unfreedom can loom , and how much , well , statism — both old-fashioned and newfangled — is ultimately required to enforce “the primacy of individual self-determination over traditional social ties , ” to protect the self-determining individual ( and the self-determining powerful stakeholder , just as importantly ) from the harshest consequences of morally-unconstrained choice , and to regulate and restrain that same self-determination whenever it transgresses the rules of tolerance and diversity .I’m afraid I don’t have an obvious alternative to “libertarian” that would encompass this third pillar of our present order , and distill the entire structure’s complexity to a single word or phrase . But the third pillar’s heft and importance is too substantial to ignore , and there are all kinds of elements of our age — from “too big to fail” to the Department of Homeland Security , from the design of Obamacare to the nature of our coalition politics , from the political forays of Mark Zuckerberg to the fate of Brendan Eich — that don’t make sense if you can’t sense its shadow , or recognize how big a role it’s likely to play , going forward , in keeping the whole edifice standing up .
Responding to my Sunday column , which compared the Democratic Party’s diverse presidential-level majority to fin-de-siecle Austria-Hungary and cast Hillary Clinton as the lone political figure capable of playing Emperor Franz Josef and holding the fractious imperium together , Jonathan Chait tweeted that the argument “needed 3000 words to be remotely persuasive.” Consider this post , then , an attempt to add some of the missing words , with a focus on the Democratic coalition’s potential 2016 weaknesses more than Hillary Clinton’s unique role within the party ( which I’ll mention below , but think is mostly self-evident ) .1 ) The Democrats have an Obama problem . The president’s approve/disapprove numbers in the RealClearPolitics average crossed over more than a year ago , and except for the deeper dip during the Obamacare rollout they’ve been remarkably steady since : About 44 percent of the country approves , about 51 percent disapproves . ( For context , Obama was at 46 approve/49 disapprove when the Republicans retook the House in 2010 , and 49 percent approve/47 percent disapprove when he won re-election . ) By historical standards , those are not truly dreadful second term numbers — they aren’t in Truman or George W. Bush territory — but they’re considerably worse than the second-term numbers enjoyed by the only two modern presidents , Reagan and Clinton , who saw would-be successors from their own party win a majority of the popular vote . ( Even during Iran-Contra , Reagan held steady at around 48-49 percent approval . )Of course Obama’s numbers could rise a bit if the economy takes off , or some foreign policy crisis intrudes in which he acquits himself well , or ( God help us ) if the Republicans decide to impeach him . But they could also fall as well , if he seems checked out and Democrats check out of defending him . His current position isn’t set in stone , but his unpopularity seems pretty durable at this point , a fact on the ground that any assessment of the two parties needs to take into account .2 ) The Democrats have a policy problem . The durability of the president’s “disapproval” rate is particularly significant because , as Chait argues in a recent post , Obama can actually claim to have fulfilled most of his major campaign promises . There are plenty of policy “might have beens …” that his supporters can raise ( second stimulus , no sequester , grand bargain , etc . ) , but on the economy , taxes , health care , education and now the environment , this president has indeed done a lot of what he promised he would do — and yet the public , at least currently , pretty clearly does not love him for it .Which in turn leaves his party in the position of seeing its highly-popular , near-landslide-winning 2008 promises ( we’ll repeal the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy and wind down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , and then use the money to fund universal health care/cut middle class taxes/increase spending on other middle-class priorities ) more or less fulfilled , without having reaped much credit from an electorate that’s currently pretty sour on this administration’s economic record , on its signature domestic policy achievement , its foreign policy stewardship , and its basic competence . And having raised taxes on the rich , having funded semi-universal health care , having wound down our foreign wars , what exactly is the Democratic Party’s agenda now ? Some combination of immigration reform , universal pre-K and a higher minimum wage , I suppose , plus maybe more tax increases , depending on how fiscally-sober the party feels . That’s a defensible message ( I certainly expect liberal pundits to defend it ) , but it’s not an agenda that’s obviously responsive to public disappointment with the Obama years .Now of course not having an agenda responsive to disappointment with his record didn’t prevent Obama from winning re-election in 2012 , which is part of why liberals have so much confidence his coalition’s relative solidity . But there are two further issues to be raised …3 ) The Democrats have a Not-Obama Problem . As various people pointed in in response to my column , all American political coalitions look a little bit like Austria-Hungary , in the sense of being ramshackle , complicated , and diverse . But there really is an unusual level of diversity inside the current Democratic tent — an unusual marriage of upper class and working class and very poor , of ethnic groups with very different stories in America , etc . And Obama really was personally unusual in the sense that his “world man” brand seemed to make him the embodiment of at least some of this diversity ( it’s rare candidate who can inspire “he understands us , he ‘s one of us” identification among both the African-American poor and the globe-hopping liberal rich ) , in ways that undoubtedly made his turnout operation’s job that much easier . As I wrote yesterday , I think the Hillary Clinton brand could probably accomplish something similar , albeit along a somewhat demographic vector ( gender identification would loom larger , some Scots-Irish voters might be pulled back into the Democratic fold ) . But the average presidential nominee is not as distinctively multitudinous a figure as a Clinton or an Obama . Would Al Gore or John Kerry have had the same turnout edge in an alternative universe 2008 or 2012 ? Would an Andrew Cuomo or an Elizabeth Warren or a Joe Biden or a Martin O’Malley ( dissolves into helpless laughter ) in 2016 ? I am extremely doubtful .4 ) The Republicans Really Can Do Better . When you get down to bedrock , a great deal of liberal commentariat’s current confidence in the Democratic coalition’s durability rests on the assumption that the Republican Party will remain a mess — divided against itself along ideological lines , imprisoned by litmus tests and its own forms of identity unpopular , and wedded to an unpopular policy agenda . Danny Vinik , writing in The New Republic , responded to my column with a good distillation of this argument , and it may turn out to be correct : I continue to suspect that the G.O.P . will underperform in the 2014 Senate races for roughly this not-ready-for-primetime reason , and the party’s presidential field is unsettled enough at the moment that just about anything could happen two years hence .But at the same time , I think that overall the G.O.P . is in a somewhat better position , on personnel and policy , going into its 2016 nominating process than it was going into 2012 . There’s more distance from the Bush legacy , more urgency about changing the party’s message , a more realistic sense of how it needs to change ( nobody , but nobody , thinks the “you built that”/”47 percent” material worked out well ) , and far fewer prominent figures insisting that True Conservatism ( TM ) alone will carry the party to an easy victory .The recent springtime for reform conservatism may be just a few shoots in a barren field … but that’s still more shoots than at this time four years ago , and nearly everything that’s pushed through the ground , whether it’s been Mike Lee or Dave Camp on taxes or Marco Rubio on the safety net or various senators on health care reform , would have been an improvement on the party’s non-message in 2012 . The roster of presidential hopefuls may not be as impressive at it looked before Chris Christie’s scandal and Marco Rubio’s immigration reform detour … but we’re still very unlikely to see a replay of the “9-9-9″/Bachmann Overdrive nonsense , and much more likely to see a group of plausible nominees having a relatively-serious debate . The party may not move on policy exactly the way reform conservatives or libertarian populists or any other group of would-be change agents might lik … . but the odds are very good that the eventual 2016 nominee will offer something more creative than the bland Mr. Republican talking points that Romney campaigned on .And my point , in stressing the Democratic Party’s potential weaknesses , is that a little something might actually be enough , even if it’s less than what I’d like to see , and less , by far , than what reform conservatism’s left-of-center critics think Republican reform would have to mean .Or it might be enough , that if the Democrats didn’t have a uniquely unifying candidate waiting the wings . But they do , her health permitting , which is the irony of this post : All the words ( not quite 2200 , but getting there ) I’ve just written about liberalism’s weaknesses are in the service of an argument that the Democratic Party will probably win the White House once again in 2016 . I just think it will take a Hillary to do it .
At the risk of exhausting my readers , I wanted to return yet again to the debate over workforce participation , because a couple of recent pieces that aren’t directly about the recent Obamacare argument have been helpful in clarifying the deeper issues in play . The first one is from Martin Wolf of the Financial Times , a sensible man of the center-left , making recommendations for how the developed world might adapt to automation , computerization and the disappearance of low-wage , low-skilled work:Third , we must reconsider leisure . For a long time the wealthiest lived a life of leisure at the expense of the toiling masses . The rise of intelligent machines makes it possible for many more people to live such lives without exploiting others . Today’s triumphant puritanism finds such idleness abhorrent . Well , then , let people enjoy themselves busily . What else is the true goal of the vast increases in prosperity we have created ?Fourth , we will need to redistribute income and wealth . Such redistribution could take the form of a basic income for every adult , together with funding of education and training at any stage in a person’s life . In this way , the potential for a more enjoyable life might become a reality .The second is a stimulating piece by Ryan Avent , writing for the Economist , in which he argues that our economy may actually be suffering from over-employment — that we’re losing potential gains from automation because we’re trying to keep so many human workers on the job . That summary doesn’t do the argument justice , so please do read it in full — but here , running parallel to Wolf’s argument , is his conclusion:[ If ] full employment is no longer compatible with full utilisation of capital … The global savings glut might well be thought of as a global labour glut .What might a potential solution look like ? Fiscal expansion could help , but the gain from fiscal policy is likely to be limited unless it is structured to try and reduce labour supply . That’s right , reduce labour supply .The most attractive options to accomplish this are probably those which seek to voluntarily reduce the number of hours of “full-time” work . John Maynard Keynes was right ; a 15-hour work week should be sufficient to provide a worker with a “full-time” income . But this will require subsidies from the state ; in the form of wage top-ups , perhaps , or a universal basic income .… . Redistribution at the scale described above would be very difficult to engineer . Society would face two main challenges ( among a pile of others ) . First , if the tax code were going to raise enough money to support non-workers from a dwindling pool of people earning high market incomes , then the tax code would need to become much more efficient . Otherwise , taxpayers would face intense pressure to reduce their tax burden in any way possible and would generally succeed : enough , anyway , to break the system . The second challenge is related ; however efficient the tax code , the social conflict arising from an effort to reorganise society in this fashion would probably be intense and unpleasant .The upside to managing the transition would be enormous , however . What we are talking about here is a world which is much , much richer . Everyone should be able to enjoy much higher incomes while doing much less work . The endpoint would not be a socialist paradise , necessarily . But it might seem a bit like one , in the way that a 19th century worker putting in 70 hours per week in an attempt to earn enough to keep his family from starving might view a world in which people are able to live in extraordinary comfort ( by comparison ) working just 40 hours per week as something like heaven .These are the sober , restrained , technocratic versions of an argument that gets made more pungently the further left you go — see this column from Salon’s Alex Pareene for a good example of the genre . In effect , these forays are opening a window into tomorrow’s policy debates , and raising the question of whether 21st century public policy should even really try to slow the decline of workforce participation — as opposed to welcoming that decline as a sign of liberation , and perhaps hastening it for the sake of efficiency as well .I think it’s important to concede up front the possibility that Wolf and Avent could be right about where we’re going . My doubts about the basic-income prescription notwithstanding , in the event that do we end up with an ever-growing share of the population consisting of what Tyler Cowen calls “zero marginal product” workers , whose continued employment is effectively a drag on productivity relative to the machine alternatives , ideas along those lines could end up being the only plausible policy response .But I also think that even if such a policy shift “worked” ( in the sense of not breaking the system along the way ) , this scenario could end up being a lot more dystopian than Wolf and Avent — let alone writers further to their left — seem ready to allow . They’re leaping from a policy designed to protect the new economy’s potential losers to an optimistic vision of more general age of leisure , and based on current trends I’m just not sure that leap is warranted . It seems just as likely that what Wolf calls ( perhaps not entirely aptly ) “triumphant puritanism” would continue to set the tone for the more successful portion of society , who would continue to work 40 , 50 , 60 hours in a quest for positional goods , and that as a result you would end up with an even more exaggerated version of the social segregation limned by Charles Murray and others — in which Belmont is Belmont and Fishtown Fishtown , and never the twain shall meet .I don’t think it’s unfair to suggest that this future , however potentially inevitable , would represent a grim retreat from basic American ideals . The promise of upward mobility and equality of opportunity would look like a transparent sham in a society with a hypercompetitive elite and a non-working working class . Likewise , the ideal of social equality — which is the really valuable thing that many liberals are groping toward in their critiques of the 1 percent — would probably suffer dramatically if full-time work , like the two-parent family before it , became something that only the better sort of American was likely to experience . And while a sufficiently generous basic income would no doubt raise living standards and reduce deprivation at the bottom , the experience of Appalachia , among other blasted social landscapes , suggests that it’s very easy for the absence of work to intertwine with social pathologies in ways that government assistance can’t necessarily ameliorate . The workless society could be a place where the “potential for a more enjoyable life” is available to all … but it could just as easily be a society with more alcoholism , more drug addiction , more obesity , lower lifespans , more social isolation , and less human flourishing overall .So while it might be that going from 40 hours to 15 ( or zero ) would offer the same straightforward gains as going from 70 hours to 40 , it also might be that the Keynesian image of a leisured utopia , like the Marxist vision of a future where anyone can “hunt in the morning , fish in the afternoon , rear cattle in the evening , criticise after dinner , just as I have a mind …” , simply doesn’t sufficiently account for either human ambition or human weakness . And I’m inclined to resist the trend that Wolf and Avent would prefer that we accept because of the way I suspect these two aspects of human nature would work , together and apart , to make the society they envision much more stratified , divided , polarized and unhappy than the utopians of yesterday expected .
PRESIDENT OBAMA has endured much criticism of his legislative skills from his fellow progressives . His conciliatory approach has been compared unfavorably with Franklin D. Roosevelt’s gleeful pugnacity and Lyndon B. Johnson’s relentless arm-twisting . His willingness to strike deals with corporations has been tagged “business as usual.” Many progressives , frustrated over the past three years , have concluded that the political system is fundamentally broken because corporate power has been allowed to suffocate popular liberal policies .But the Supreme Court’s upholding of Mr. Obama’s health care law reminds us that the president’s approach has achieved significant results . If his liberal critics paused to assess how he achieved such results , they would not see a system paralyzed by corporations ; they would see that the most liberal reforms in more than 40 years have been brought about because Mr. Obama views corporate power as a force to bargain with , not an enemy to vanquish .The necessity of corporate support for , or at least acquiescence to , liberal policies is not a new development in the history of American liberalism . Indeed it has been one of its hallmarks .Roosevelt may be remembered for his combativeness toward corporations ; he famously said , “I welcome their hatred.” But he said that in 1936 , only after key New Deal legislation had passed with the help of the United States Chamber of Commerce and the American Bankers Association .Early on , Roosevelt was quite adept at bargaining with corporations . In his first 100 days , to attract corporate support for the National Industrial Recovery Act , he won collective bargaining , minimum wages and maximum hours in exchange for a temporary suspension of antitrust law , so businesses could fix prices . To establish the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1934 , he made concessions to Wall Street that scrapped statutory requirements in favor of regulatory flexibility . The following year , to allow the Federal Reserve to better conduct monetary policy , he gave bankers representation on the policy committee .Johnson also found little value in warring with corporations . He won a Keynesian tax cut in early 1964 , defeating budget-conscious conservatives , thanks to a broad coalition that included corporations . He attracted business support to back his first antipoverty bill by junking plans to promote family farming and push businesses to hire long-term unemployed people . He created the Transportation Department , in 1966 , only after exempting resistant shipping interests from its jurisdiction . He incited a new era of environmental protection , increasing federal responsibility for cleaning air and water , while defusing corporate opposition by trading away federal pollution standards .Democratic presidents typically pay dearly when they choose to fight corporations instead of deal with them . Jimmy Carter sapped his political capital in the first two years of his presidency by trying to pass , with belligerent anticorporate rhetoric , a National Energy Act that would reduce our dependence on oil . He gave two major national addresses intended to rally the public and fend off critics’ attacks . At a town hall , he lashed out at oil companies for enjoying “a position of privilege in our country for too long” and having undue influence in Congress . But these confrontational tactics failed to rouse enough public ire to trump that influence , and Mr. Carter settled for a far smaller energy bill than he originally demanded .Or consider President Bill Clinton . In 1993 , his health care task force largely resisted meeting with insurance lobbyists as it drafted legislation . In turn , the insurers didn’t wait for the legislation to be finalized before embarking on a vicious advertising campaign . When the first lady , Hillary Rodham Clinton , tried to belittle that effort , fund-raising for the insurance lobby skyrocketed and its advertising budget quintupled . Mr. Clinton , his bully pulpit diminished , couldn’t get Congress to vote on his bill . He suffered such a humiliating defeat that his ability to enact any other progressive reform was severely crippled .
My Sunday column , on Thomas Piketty’s revival of the old argument that capitalism tends to enrich the capital-rich Few much , much faster than the laboring Many , didn’t take a position on the plausibility of the French economist’s basic forecast , which foresees upper-tail inequality rising forever absent a sustained political disruption . ( For a more qualified observer’s critique of that forecast , Tyler Cowen’s review and follow-up are the place to turn . ) Instead , I argued against the view that such a trend would necessarily lead to such political disruptions , or indeed be particularly destabilizing to the developed world’s societies . So long as a rich country’s Many see some real gains , I suggested , whether through modest growth and/or modestly-increasing redistribution , we aren’t likely to see anything remotely like the kind of literal class warfare that the last gilded age produced .The likelihood of such class-based violence and upheaval is not central to Piketty’s thesis . But its invocation , amid the Balzac references and “Titanic” call-outs and Marx-imitating title , is part of what gives his “Capital in the Twenty-First Century” its frisson .Early in the book , for instance , he cites Haymarket and the fusillade de Fourmies as case studies in past labor-capital conflicts , and asks , portentously , whether “this kind of violent clash between labor and capital belong [ s ] to the past , ” or whether it’s likely to “be an integral part of twenty-first-century history ? ”Where rich economies are concerned , here’s my column’s case for why the answer is , “probably not”:… as the Manhattan Institute’s Scott Winship has pointed out , Piketty’s data seems to understate the income gains enjoyed by most Americans over the last two generations . These gains have not been as impressive as during the post-World War II years , but they do exist : For now , even as the rich have gotten much , much richer , the 99 percent have shared in growing prosperity in real , measurable ways .… even if Piketty’s broad projections are correct , the future he envisions might be much more stable and sustainable than many on the left tend to assume . Even if the income and wealth distributions look more Victorian , that is , the 99 percent may still be doing well enough to be wary of any political movement that seems too radical , too utopian , too inclined to rock the boat .This possibility might help explain why the far left remains , for now , politically weak even as it enjoys a miniature intellectual renaissance . And it might hint at a reason that so much populist energy , in both the United States and Europe , has come from the right instead — from movements like the Tea Party , Britain’s UKIP , France’s National Front and others that incorporate some Piketty-esque arguments ( attacks on crony capitalism ; critiques of globalization ) but foreground cultural anxieties …On the point about the right and cultural anxiety I’ll have more to say later , but for now I want to address a potential left-wing rejoinder to the above argument : Namely , that in an age of constantly-increasing inequality the modest-but-real middle and working class gains of the past few decade are likely to eventually diminish and disappear , because the super-wealthy will eventually get powerful enough to make sure that all ( or almost all ) new wealth eventually flows upward .This argument would take the recent economic trends discussed in my last post — the fact that in the United States , the gains for the 90 percent that Winship describes were stronger in the 1980s and 1990s than in the last decade — and extrapolate it forward ; it would weave in a version of the story Vox’s Ezra Klein tells here about how “the doom loop of oligarchy” concentrates income and wealth and also protects the wealthy from political challenges ; and it would end up with a scenario in which wealth begets power , which begets wealth , which begets power , until upward redistribution of wealth is an ironclad norm and the working class’s only option is the barricades .The problem with this “Haymarket 2028″ vision , I think , is that it overestimates the unity of the oligarchs ( whose interests and views will collide as often as they align ) and underestimates the power that even a weakened 99 percent ( or 90 percent , or for that matter 47 percent ) can exercise through the ballot box .In the case of the post-1970s United States , in particular , a “doom loop” theory suggests that we should see marginal tax rates , taxes on capital , and corporate taxes fall persistently as inequality increases and the wealth-power nexus tightens . And it implies , perhaps , that the political/policy center of gravity should shift steadily rightward under the influence of all that self-interested , influence-buying , opinion-shaping money .But the actual policy trend doesn’t really look like that . Instead , taxes on high incomes bottomed out in the mid-1980s ( when our Gini coefficient was much lower ) and have bounced around , and upward , in the two decades since ; taxes on capital went down steadily from the ’80s into the 2000s , but for high incomes they’re now back where they were in the 1990s ( with an Obamacare surcharge on top ) ; our corporate tax rates were cut in the 1980s but haven’t much budged since . Meanwhile , the non-defense budget has been on a consistent upward trend ( see figure 3 here ) since , again , the mid-1980s , and elite-driven causes like entitlement reform and immigration reform have been repeatedly defeated by populist rebellions , left and right . And notwithstanding liberal anxieties that the Bush Republicans had found a way to push the whole political debate “off center , ” the post-2000 trend toward stagnant incomes helped drive a leftward swing in public opinion , leading to the election of President Obama , an unprecedented surge of stimulus spending , a large expansion of the federal safety net , a significant increase in upper-bracket taxes , and so on .Now it’s true that post-2010 budget cuts have counteracted some of these leftward policy shifts , and it’s also true if enacted as written Paul Ryan’s safety net cuts would send U.S. policy swinging in a direction favored by ( some Republican ) oligarchs . But Ryan was on the ticket that lost the last presidential election , and nobody ( the Wisconsin congressman included , I would say ) believes that his party is well-positioned to win future elections running on an austerity platform alone .The radical left may be weak , in other words , but the center-left is more powerful and better-positioned today than a “doom loop” theory would suggest . On the evidence of the last generation of American politics , then , rich democratic polities seem likely to respond to increasing inequality and stagnant wages not by handing power over to mustache-twirling robber barons , but by embracing a kind of liberal corporatism , which protects the interests of well-off rentiers and 1 percenters on many policy fronts , but also buys social peace by expanding social welfare programs and raising taxes on the very rich ( whose extraordinary wealth may ultimately make them less tax-sensitive than they were a generation back ) .Such corporatist tax-and-transfer policies aren’t likely to level the income distribution to anything like the extent that Piketty believes is morally and socially necessary . But they do seem likely , even if his underlying analysis were correct , to tax enough , and redistribute enough , to maintain the richest nations’ social peace , and avoid violent labor-capital conflict by making even the relatively poor feel like they have too much to lose from such upheaval .I hope it’s clear that I don’t see this as a particularly optimistic scenario . I would much rather live in a society where increasing prosperity is broadly shared than one where it’s shared just enough , through slowly-rising wages and modestly-increasing transfer payments , to maintain most people’s status quo bias even in the face of widening class divisions and increasing lower-class dependency . And as someone who thinks we face a somewhat different sort of inequality-related crisis than Piketty and the neo-Marxists — one that’s more about social and cultural and moral capital than the purely pecuniary sort — I’m inclined to welcome radical critiques of current arrangements , because I know a few of my own ideas are pretty radical as well .But that conversation benefits from realism about the current trajectory we’re on , which for all its problems doesn’t necessarily portend major disruptions and class conflicts just ahead .
I wrote a little on Wednesday about what I described as the uncertain implications of David Brat’s primary victory for the future of a more reform-minded conservatism . For a less uncertain take on the matter , here is David Frum , arguing that the only way to reform the Republican Party is for figures like Eric Cantor – or , I suppose , his successors in the leadership — to take the fight more ruthlessly to the party’s insurgents:At some point , Republican leaders must recognize that they have a fight on their hands whether they like it or not . If they refuse to join that fight , they will be devoured anyway . If they surrender , they condemn the whole conservative project in America to the destructive leadership of fanatics ( and the cynics who make their living by duping fanatics ) .This lesson keeps being administered . Republican leaders repeatedly refuse to learn .The political exemplar most relevant to today’s GOP is not the oft-invoked Ronald Reagan . It is Tony Blair , who revived his party by standing up to its most extreme elements . There is no such leadership yet on the Republican side . If Republicans don’t develop it soon , we might just as well already rename our dysfunctional party the Committee to Elect Hillary Clinton .It’s fair to say that Frum has taken this view for a long time , while many of us who march ( skip ? toddle ? ) under the reformist banner – see , for instance , Yuval Levin in this post on the relationship between the Tea Party and reform conservatism – have been inclined to hope for , and worked toward , some form of synthesis instead , in which the base-versus-establishment war isn’t fought out but somehow transcended . And while I’m not sure that such a synthesis is possible , Brat’s anti-Cantor campaign is actually a useful case study in why it seems so necessary . Here is Ryan Lizza on some of the attack lines Brat used against the House Majority Leader:In his campaign against Cantor , Brat turned every issue into a morality tale about big business cheating ordinary Americans . He attacked Cantor for supporting the farm bill ( “Do those billions of dollars go to the small American farmer ? No , they go to huge agribusiness , right ? Big business again.” ) , the flood-insurance bill ( “Who does that go to ? A lot of the money goes to gazillionaires on both coasts who have homes in nice real-estate locations.” ) , and the STOCK Act , an effort to stop insider trading by congressmen , which Cantor gutted by including an exception for spouses …By the end of the campaign , immigration reform , another policy championed by Stephenson in his op-ed , had become Brat’s most visible point of attack against Cantor . But even here , Brat framed the issue within his larger argument about corporate welfare , arguing that the Senate bill would reward big business with a stream of cheap labor at the expense of American workers . ( And anyone who followed the debate over the Senate bill knows that it was larded with favors for big corporations . )So what would it mean for the establishment , as currently constituted and oriented , to “fight back” against this kind of message ? Should Cantor have gone to the hustings to defend his role in passing farm bills – some of the most abominable pieces of legislation churned out by business-as-usual politics in D.C. ? Should he have talked proudly about how his changes to the STOCK Act improved the bill dramatically ? Should he have followed the example of Lindsey Graham in South Carolina , and defended comprehensive immigration reform on the primary trail ?I know that lots of moderate Republicans would answer yes to the last question . But as a staunch opponent of the Senate immigration bill , Frum himself isn’t one of them ; indeed , Brat’s “corporate welfare” argument could have been lifted from one of his own critiques of the G.O.P . leadership’s zeal for amnesty and guest workers .Instead , Frum would probably say that establishment Republicans need to fight back against what Lizza calls “the core of Brat’s ideology “ – “an unvarnished belief … that the government should return to its pre-New Deal roots.” But it’s worth noting that ( however clumsily ) Cantor tried to do just that : One of his campaign’s attack lines against Brat was that the Randolph-Macon academic’s ideas required the dismantling of Social Security . The line , it seem , did not stick , or else did not trump the “who’s looking out for you ? ” oomph of Brat’s libertarian populist appeal .So while I agree with Frum that the “let’s turn the clock back to 1929” aspect of the Tea Party movement , like the base’s allergy to compromise in governance , is a big problem for the Republican Party , I just don’t see how the establishment can successfully fight its grassroots opponents so long as those opponents have so many perfectly legitimate grievances to fasten on . Instead , you need — somehow — a Republican leadership that can first persuade these voters and activists that it’s in touch with their concerns , that it’s philosophically in tune with them , and that it isn’t just relying on their votes while ignoring their interests and desires . Reform and innovation can only happen , in this view , in an atmosphere of ideological trust — which is why reformists have placed a lot of their/our hopes in figures who came in with the Tea Party , like Mike Lee and Marco Rubio , rather than expecting a John Boehner or a Mitch McConnell to lead the party forward on policy .Frum , on Twitter yesterday , called this the “I 100 % agree with you and that’s why we should do the exact opposite of what you say” approach to the base and conservative reform . It’s a good line , but naturally I see it as more of an “I agree with your critique and I share your anger at the status quo , so here’s why we should do some of what you say … but then here are some other things that make more sense than shutting down the government” argument . And the model for how this works in political practice , I think , would necessarily look more like Reagan than like Blair — not in the sense that it would involve an exact reprise of Reaganomics ( reform conservatism’s Wall Street Journal critics are entirely correct that it would not ) , but in the sense that Reagan was a politician who channeled conservative populism without letting it consume him , who was guided by ideology without being imprisoned by it , and who worked , mostly successfully , in the zone where right-wing populism and middle American anxiety overlapped . And that balancing act , rather than the defeat of right-wing populism by the forces of the K Street and their out-of-touch champions , seems like what both the right and the country need again today .As in the late 1970s and early ’80s , this kind of synthesis can probably only happen at the presidential level , for some of the reasons my colleague Josh Barro suggests today . And maybe ( as Barro , a continuing skeptic of reform conservatism’s prospects , tends to think ) there’s simply no figure or figures on the Republican horizon capable of imitating and updating the fortieth president’s success .But the Blair alternative , Frum’s vision for the G.O.P. , requires a situation that simply doesn’t obtain in American politics at the moment : A landscape in which the other side — Thatcherism for the Blairites , Obama-era liberalism for today’s right — has won so many clear and sweeping victories that the necessary concessions are basically obvious , and the alternative is clearly just continued political impotence , defeat after defeat after defeat . That’s simply not where we are right now , both headed into 2014 and looking ahead to the post-Obama era . Maybe we’ll end up there eventually , if Obamacare solidifies and becomes more popular , the global situation stabilizes , and the economy gets to 1990s-style growth . But until then , in an unsettled landscape , conservative reformers have an opportunity to offer an actual alternative , rather than just an adaptation — and there is no path to that alternative that doesn’t partake , at least to some extent , of the populist spirit currently ascendant on the right .

ChicagoEarlier this month , I was hanging out with my brother-in-law Vincent . He lives with developmental disabilities caused by an unwanted genetic sequence that deprives his brain of a critical protein . We were sitting in our family room when Rick Santorum — whose 3-year-old daughter has a different chromosomal disorder — appeared on the television .“One of the things that you don’t know about ObamaCare , ” Mr. Santorum said , is that it requires “free prenatal testing ... Why ? Because free prenatal testing ends up in more abortions and , therefore , less care that has to be done , because we cull the ranks of the disabled in our society.” Mr. Santorum’s comment echoed Sarah Palin’s famous charge during the health care reform debate : “My parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama’s ‘death panel’ so his bureaucrats can decide , based on a subjective judgment of their ‘level of productivity in society , ’ whether they are worthy of health care.”There is no basis whatsoever for Mr. Santorum or Ms. Palin’s comments . Disability advocates across the political spectrum strongly supported the 2010 health care reform . They had obvious reasons to do so . The new law provides protections for people with preexisting conditions , regulations to make sure insurers properly cover care for chronic illnesses and expanded coverage for young adults and low-income families .But more is at stake here than factual inaccuracies . Mr. Santorum and Ms. Palin are spreading a poisonous meme : that liberals disdain the disabled and look down upon parents who raise children with physical or intellectual limitations . They seek to insert the hateful rhetoric of the culture war into one of the few areas of American life that had remained relatively free of such rancor . Care for people with disabilities has quietly been one of the few causes in this country on which social liberals and conservatives could put aside their differences to get important work done . I fear this may be changing , and at the precise moment when budget crises and the knife fight over health care reform place the future of key disability services into doubt .Since at least the 1970s , when the prospect of mass prenatal screening for genetic abnormalities first emerged , many people have worried that such technologies would coarsen public attitudes toward disabled citizens and erode support for essential services . Disability advocates were ( and remain ) divided . Some caregivers regard such tests — which can lead to abortions after unfavorable results — as an affront to the equal humanity of their loved ones . Others quietly note the value of such testing , and even suggest that terminating a pregnancy is sometimes the better course . But no matter how heated the disagreements between the anti-abortion and abortion rights camps , people of good will on both sides found ways to collaborate on the shared goal of improving the lives and opportunities of men and women with disabilities .Many fears regarding screening turned out to be unwarranted . It’s remarkable how much our nation has opened its heart to millions of people with intellectual disabilities since the middle of the last century . These developments are doubly admirable because they happened so steadily and so quietly , outside the usual disfiguring frame of partisan politics . Americans of many religions , backgrounds and ideologies have much to be proud of in this story .Consider the World War II conscientious objectors who were assigned to work in state homes for the mentally retarded , and who went public , writing in magazines such as Christian Century about the terrible conditions they had seen . Under Dwight D. Eisenhower , Social Security’s Disabled Adult Child program — from which Vincent still receives lifetime cash benefits — went into effect .The first Special Olympics were held in 1968 , in large part thanks to the efforts of Eunice Kennedy Shriver , an anti-abortion liberal Catholic , and Medicare and Medicaid , the two most important programs for financing the treatment and care of disabled Americans , were enacted in 1965 by Great Society liberals . Richard M. Nixon worked with Congress to enact Supplemental Security Income , which established income security for millions of people with disabilities . Not long after , President Gerald R. Ford signed what is now the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act , guaranteeing access to special education and other services . Senators Edward M. Kennedy and Robert Dole collaborated to pass the Americans With Disabilities Act , which opened many opportunities in public accommodations and the work force , and the business community later stepped up to find ways for adults with developmental disabilities to earn a paycheck for real work .Today , social conservatives in the Knights of Columbus sell Tootsie Rolls on street corners supporting group homes and workshops , while liberal activists fight to ensure that disabled Medicaid recipients have access to proper dental care and other services .As a result of this hard work , things have gotten better . Sixty years ago , the birth of an intellectually disabled child was viewed as a private tragedy . Families did the best they could , for as long as they could , or turned to forbidding public institutions for help . Now millions of men and women with intellectual disabilities live with greater dignity with their families or in human-scale group homes in their own communities . And every day , our family experiences countless acts of kindness and acceptance : harried business travelers patiently wait as we move ever so slowly through the airport security check ; tough South Side Chicago kids wave back when Vincent waves at them ; students at our daughters’ school react kindly to their classmates’ unusual-looking uncle .Liberals and conservatives deserve credit for working together to promote genuine progress in these areas . It isn’t easy , because we have genuine differences regarding the size and role of government , abortion , separation of church and state . But Mr. Santorum wants to exploit these differences . Mr. Santorum faces an uphill political climb . But whatever happens with his candidacy , he can still tear this particularly delicate piece of our social fabric before he’s through . We can’t let him do that .
NELSON’S doctors found the bulge in his abdomen on a Monday . An ultrasound and CT scan showed that a mass was crowding out his stomach and kidneys . It was one of the largest the doctors had ever seen . If they didn’t do something , he’d be dead in a couple of days .The hospital gave him a blood transfusion because he was anemic . A radiologist noticed that something might be wrong with his adrenal gland . His surgical team removed what turned out to be a 12.5-pound tumor , lifting it out like an overgrown newborn . Nelson’s intensive care nurse called his family that night , and his internists gave them regular updates until he was discharged .Nelson’s health insurance covered 90 percent of the costs after a reasonable $ 500 deductible . I’m happy he has such good health coverage . He’s my dog . And I’m jealous of him .He has the kind of health care that I’d hoped the Affordable Care Act would usher in for those who , like my wife and me , have to buy health insurance on the open market . I’d long been frustrated at how health care shackles people to corporate jobs . I believed this legislation , signed four years ago this month , would free people to pursue their dreams , start new companies and not worry about the health insurance penalty .What I didn’t count on was that it would make things harder for me and my wife .First , we were notified that we would be kicked out of our existing $ 263-a-month Anthem Blue Cross plan because it didn’t meet the minimum standards of the new law . No problem , I thought . The plans in the new Covered California exchange would most likely be better and cheaper .But we were shocked at what we confronted . The least expensive premium for a couple like us in our 40s would be about $ 620 a month . And because our household adjusted gross income is likely to be over the $ 62,040 cutoff this year , it’s doubtful we’ll end up with a subsidy to help offset that price increase .Having always had insurance , we began to wonder if we might have to go uninsured , but in the end , we enrolled . It’s as if we just bought a new car that we will never see and that we can never pay off .The gulf between my health care world and my dog’s was driven home the other week . I have mild asthma . Normally it’s not a problem , but when I get a chest cold , it becomes severe . One recent day I found that I couldn’t breathe . My inhalers were all expired . I’d held off refilling them since my insurance would reduce the costs of the $ 58.99 inhalers only by a little more than $ 9 . I knew from past experience that I probably needed a prescription for antibiotics , so I tried frantically to find a medical facility that would take our new Covered California Anthem Blue Cross bronze plan . When I did , they said it would be three weeks before I could see a doctor . Instead , I went to the drugstore and bought all the nonprescription medication that might help .Around the same time , Nelson developed a skin infection . I got an appointment at the vet’s the next day . They prescribed an antibiotic and did some blood tests . The medication caused diarrhea so I called his internist at his vet hospital , PetCare , and she prescribed a probiotic . Nelson’s $ 40.42-a-month pet insurance isn’t perfect — for instance it doesn’t cover pre-existing conditions — but it paid almost all of these costs , and the vet followed up to make sure he was doing O.K .I was envious . My 11-year-old brown Labrador was getting the kind of treatment that I could only dream of . I wanted to go to PetCare . I wanted pet insurance .I know that Obamacare is helping a great number of people . I understand that for the first time millions of people are getting health insurance . It’s the one thing that gives me solace .But let’s not pretend that this new policy is the affordable health care savior that many of us were hoping for . For us , our new plan is a big financial hit for a product that does not make it any easier to get basic health care .It’s still hard to understand what coverage we have . It’s like trying to read tea leaves . Benefits descriptions can be contradictory and run nearly 200 pages long . One summary attached to my online account seems to say that if I go to the emergency room , I could potentially owe thousands of dollars . Another document suggests that I’m responsible for only $ 300 . I’ve had two representatives give me two different explanations . The more I questioned these well-intentioned people , the more I realized how confused , overwhelmed and at times plain wrong they were .Here’s what I’ve been able to piece together . Previously , our family deductible totaled $ 13,600 for outpatient care and $ 6,600 for hospital care ( with a maximum combined out-of-pocket cost of $ 13,600 ) . Under our new plan , we have a deductible of $ 10,000 ( and an out-of-pocket maximum of $ 12,700 ) . In both cases , having deductibles that high means this is largely insurance to make sure that we don’t go bankrupt if we become very ill . Yes , the new plan has more coverage , including pediatric vision . But we don’t have children , and I’d trade coverage for things like substance abuse treatment and mental health in return for lower premiums .And if you see a doctor outside your network , look out . We found this out the hard way . My wife and I both had to see a doctor in January . Our old policy and our new Covered California policy were both with Anthem Blue Cross , so a representative there told us to use our old ID cards for our visits since our new cards hadn’t arrived yet . We were covered , he assured us . At the medical center , we gave our ID cards to the receptionist , who accepted them as valid , and went in to see our regular doctors . But later we found out that they were not in our new network’s plan . The out-of-pocket cost for my simple 30-minute office visit : $ 303 . My wife’s annual exam and a couple of minor procedures : $ 918 .We’re still waiting for quality health care that we can actually use , afford and understand — the kind of care that Nelson gets .

THE device in your purse or jeans that you think is a cellphone — guess again . It is a tracking device that happens to make calls . Let’s stop calling them phones . They are trackers .Most doubts about the principal function of these devices were erased when it was recently disclosed that cellphone carriers responded 1.3 million times last year to law enforcement requests for call data . That’s not even a complete count , because T-Mobile , one of the largest carriers , did not initially reveal its total . It appears that millions of cellphone users have been swept up in government surveillance of their calls and where they made them from . Many police agencies don’t obtain search warrants when requesting location data from carriers .Thanks to the explosion of GPS technology and smartphone apps , these devices are also taking note of what we buy , where and when we buy it , how much money we have in the bank , whom we text and e-mail , what Web sites we visit , how and where we travel , what time we go to sleep and wake up — and more . Much of that data is shared with companies that use it to offer us services they think we want .We have all heard about the wonders of frictionless sharing , whereby social networks automatically let our friends know what we are reading or listening to , but what we hear less about is frictionless surveillance . Though we invite some tracking — think of our mapping requests as we try to find a restaurant in a strange part of town — much of it is done without our awareness .“Every year , private companies spend millions of dollars developing new services that track , store and share the words , movements and even the thoughts of their customers , ” writes Paul Ohm , a law professor at the University of Colorado . “These invasive services have proved irresistible to consumers , and millions now own sophisticated tracking devices ( smartphones ) studded with sensors and always connected to the Internet.”Mr. Ohm labels them tracking devices . So does Jacob Appelbaum , a developer and spokesman for the Tor project , which allows users to browse the Web anonymously . Scholars have called them minicomputers and robots . Everyone is struggling to find the right tag , because “cellphone” and “smartphone” are inadequate . This is not a semantic game . Names matter , quite a bit . In politics and advertising , framing is regarded as essential because what you call something influences what you think about it . That’s why there are battles over the tags “Obamacare” and “death panels.”In just the past few years , cellphone companies have honed their geographic technology , which has become almost pinpoint . The surveillance and privacy implications are quite simple . If someone knows exactly where you are , they probably know what you are doing . Cellular systems constantly check and record the location of all phones on their networks — and this data is particularly treasured by police departments and online advertisers . Cell companies typically retain your geographic information for a year or longer , according to data gathered by the Justice Department .What’s the harm ? The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit , ruling about the use of tracking devices by the police , noted that GPS data can reveal whether a person “is a weekly church goer , a heavy drinker , a regular at the gym , an unfaithful husband , an outpatient receiving medical treatment , an associate of particular individuals or political groups — and not just one such fact about a person , but all such facts.” Even the most gregarious of sharers might not reveal all that on Facebook .There is an even more fascinating and diabolical element to what can be done with location information . New research suggests that by cross-referencing your geographical data with that of your friends , it’s possible to predict your future whereabouts with a much higher degree of accuracy .This is what’s known as predictive modeling , and it requires nothing more than your cellphone data .If we are naïve to think of them as phones , what should we call them ? Eben Moglen , a law professor at Columbia University , argues that they are robots for which we — the proud owners — are merely the hands and feet . “They see everything , they’re aware of our position , our relationship to other human beings and other robots , they mediate an information stream around us , ” he has said . Over time , we’ve used these devices less for their original purpose . A recent survey by O2 , a British cell carrier , showed that making calls is the fifth-most-popular activity for smartphones ; more popular uses are Web browsing , checking social networks , playing games and listening to music . Smartphones are taking over the functions that laptops , cameras , credit cards and watches once performed for us .If you want to avoid some surveillance , the best option is to use cash for prepaid cellphones that do not require identification . The phones transmit location information to the cell carrier and keep track of the numbers you call , but they are not connected to you by name . Destroy the phone or just drop it into a trash bin , and its data can not be tied to you . These cellphones , known as burners , are the threads that connect privacy activists , Burmese dissidents and coke dealers .Prepaids are a hassle , though . What can the rest of us do ? Leaving your smartphone at home will help , but then what’s the point of having it ? Turning it off when you’re not using it will also help , because it will cease pinging your location to the cell company , but are you really going to do that ? Shutting it down does not even guarantee it’s off — malware can keep it on without your realizing it . The only way to be sure is to take out the battery . Guess what ? If you have an iPhone , you will need a tiny screwdriver to remove the back cover . Doing that will void your warranty .Matt Blaze , a professor of computer and information science at the University of Pennsylvania , has written extensively about these issues and believes we are confronted with two choices : “Don’t have a cellphone or just accept that you’re living in the Panopticon.”There is another option . People could call them trackers . It’s a neutral term , because it covers positive activities — monitoring appointments , bank balances , friends — and problematic ones , like the government and advertisers watching us .We can love or hate these devices — or love and hate them — but it would make sense to call them what they are so we can fully understand what they do .

Oralia Barrios knew she’d gotten heavy , but she didn’t realize how heavy until she went to the doctor last year . At 5-foot-2 , she weighed 190 pounds . And her doctor at the Open Door Family Medical Center in Port Chester , N.Y. , had bad news : her blood sugar was too high . Her A1c test showed that her hemoglobin level was 5.9 , making her pre-diabetic .“I heard that , and I went to pieces , ” she said . In 2002 , her father had died of diabetes-related kidney failure . “He was diabetic for a long time , ” she said . “He had high blood pressure and was nearly blind . He suffered a lot — and we suffered with him.” He was 52 when he died — 15 years older than Barrios is now .Unlike her father , however , Barrios could get effective help . The YMCA in nearby Rye is one of 128 YMCAs across the country running the Diabetes Prevention Program . The Y coordinates patient groups at various sites , including at Open Door . Barrios’ doctor sent her to Rolando Alvarez , a patient advocate at Open Door , who was starting a new group at the clinic for people who were pre-diabetic . It was a big commitment , Alvarez said — she would have to attend a weekly meeting for four months , and a monthly meeting for the rest of the year . Barrios joined a Spanish-language group with four other women . They met around a conference table at Open Door . Alvarez used the Program’s formal curriculum : What are healthy foods ? How can I be active ? What can I do besides eat to alleviate stress ? How can I eat healthy food when I eat out ? How do I deal with setbacks ? Participants were given a calorie and fat counter book , and had to record everything they ate .A lot of it was conversation , though — the women helping each other . The most useful thing she learned , Barrios said , was how to say “no” in a way that was courteous but firm . Some of the women took Zumba or yoga classes together . Barrios started walking and biking , and learned to build more exercise into her job as a housekeeper . “I used to wait to collect all the towels and bring them upstairs together . Now I bring them upstairs one by one — I go up and down those stairs with energy.”Barrios crash dieted while she waited for the class to start , and lost 22 pounds . By three months into the class , she had lost 23 more , and her blood sugar returned to normal levels . She has now gained back some weight , but it’s not because her diet is slipping — she’s five months pregnant .As anyone who has ever dieted knows , Barrios’ journey is remarkable . Changing a lifestyle is very , very hard . But the journey of the Diabetes Prevention Program itself is just as remarkable . In 2002 , the New England Journal of Medicine published results of a randomized controlled trial comparing two interventions designed to keep people at high risk for Type 2 diabetes from developing the disease . Participants who took the drug metformin had a 31 percent lower incidence of developing diabetes than people who took a placebo . But far more effective was a lifestyle-change program : participants met individually with nutritionists , exercise physiologists or behavioral psychologists weekly for six months , plus monthly classes afterwards .This group had a 58 percent lower incidence rate — so effective that the study was stopped early , and all participants offered classes .These were great results . But dozens , maybe hundreds , of papers on successful programs are published every year . “I’m around this type of research a lot : wow ! this works ! — and then it never goes anywhere , ” said Ronald Ackermann , director of the Center for Community Health at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine . This one looked particularly unpromising . Hiring professionals for a year’s worth of training is expensive . And it’s preventive medicine that the U.S. medical system , with its twisted priorities , doesn’t cover . And one-on-one programs can’t reach a lot of people . There are 86 million prediabetics among Americans over 20 . Of Americans over 65 , only 23 percent are not prediabetic or diabetic . The problem is big — but this intervention seemed destined to be small .Yet 11 years after the study was published , the Diabetes Prevention Program helped Oralia Barrios to climb out of the danger zone . More than 20,000 people have done the program , and it has the potential to reach enough people to make a significant difference in America’s diabetes epidemic .So how did the Diabetes Prevention Program grow ? Here are the steps .Discover what people should do . Type 2 diabetes , the kind that’s epidemic , can be prevented most of the time by eating right and exercising . This was not a mystery ; lack of knowledge wasn’t the obstacle .Get people to do it . The obstacle was getting people to actually make these changes — and the news in the study was that people can be helped to make them . Research published this year of those participants in the original showed that while there was falloff , there was falloff in every group — but the program group was still better off . In other words , the gains persisted .The next big breakthrough came with the addition of the YMCA . Ackermann , then at Indiana University’s School of Medicine , had worked with the Y in Seattle on a previous research project . In 2003 , he and Dr. David Marrero began a study with two YMCA sites in Indianapolis . The control group got normal testing and counseling . At the other Y , the staff was trained in the Diabetes Prevention Program curriculum — adapted for use in group classes . After six months , the program participants had lost 6 percent of their body weight , while the control group members lost only 2 percent , and the differences lasted .This study was proof-of-concept of several steps necessary for scale-up .Get people to do it cheaply . Hiring health professionals to counsel patients individually was expensive — a patient’s first year cost $ 1400 . But the Y does it for $ 275 to $ 325 . They hired good facilitators — who made a lot less money than nutritionists or psychologists — and then trained them in the Diabetes Prevention Program curriculum . Numerous studies have since shown that outcomes are the same .Get lots of people to do it cheaply . The more significant savings came from switching to group classes — a way to treat many times the people for the same cost . We’ve long known that groups are effective at helping people lose weight — at every kind of behavior change , really . “The group model combines all these ingredients we know are essential and does it in a way that you get the support and assistance you need , ” said Michele Heisler , a professor of internal medicine and health behavior and health education , at the University of Michigan’s School of Public Health .Systematically get lots of people to do it cheaply . “The discussion was : how do we create a national program ? ” said Ackermann . “It wasn’t that we thought it’s not a good idea to do this in a church basement . GM and Ford wanted to do worksite groups . But we wanted a national approach.”The YMCA had the national structure to spread the program and train facilitators . It focuses on health , knows how to reach low-income people and has thousands of branches . Eighty percent of Americans live within five miles of a Y , and Y’s are in or near many neighborhoods that suffer the most from diabetes . “If the Y couldn’t do it — well , we couldn’t think of another national organization , ” said Ackermann .Today , YMCAs in 41 states run program group classes . Half meet at Ys , and the other half meet in places such as libraries , church basements and health centers .Participants’ average weight loss at the end of the year-long program is 6.1 percent of their body weight . But averages can mislead — a few successes like Barrios can distort them . Alvarez’s first class was cancelled because not enough people enrolled . And in the second class he ran , only two of the seven participants met the goal of losing 7 percent of their weight and exercising 150 minutes per week .The day I visited Alvarez’s group , which was in its maintenance phase , talking about strategies for dealing with setbacks , only Juana Damián was there . ( I spoke to Barrios later by phone . ) “They get through the weekly classes fine , ” Alvarez said . “But with maintenance , they’d like to come but it’s more difficult . Since its once a month , they might forget . And work will always come first.”Damián is his most consistent participant . She , like Barrios , lost a lot by crash dieting before the class began . She hasn’t lost much more , though — one big reason is the stress of caring for her mother , who is paralyzed from a diabetes-related stroke . But the class has helped her maintain a loss that otherwise might have evaporated .Get someone to pay for it . A work in progress . The Y charges $ 429 for the program ( there are scholarships ) — but it should be free . Diabetes is an expensive disease . A 2010 report from UnitedHealth Group says that its average cost to cover a person with no chronic disease is $ 4,400 per year . For a diabetic with no symptoms , $ 11,700 . With complications : $ 20,700 .Another study calculates the cost savings over 10 years if Medicare covered participation in the diabetes program and three to five percent of senior participated : $ 1.3 billion . Such coverage would also result in a million fewer diabetes cases over 10 years .The American health system doesn’t much care . Obamacare has brought piecemeal progress ( see here and here ) towards expanding and getting coverage for the program , but in general neither Medicaid , Medicare nor most private insurers cover prevention — although this is starting to change with Obamacare’s Accountable Care Organizations .In 2009 , the Centers for Disease Control convened a meeting with diabetes experts , YMCA officials and representatives of various insurance companies to discuss what it would take to get coverage . The Y offered a deal : pay for performance . It proposed that insurers only pay when participants attend classes and lose weight . United Healthcare became the first to accept ; now 28 different insurers cover the program . Sen. Al Franken has introduced a bill that would have Medicare cover the program as well .“There is a change in the conversation nationally , ” said Jonathan Lever , vice president for health strategy and innovation at the YMCA of the USA . “For ACOs , this is attractive . Prevention is a topic . But it’s not happening in a systematic way . We’re knocking at the door . But the jury’s still out on whether systems will align to make it possible.”Join Fixes on Facebook and follow updates on twitter.com/nytimesfixes .

Turning back to this week’s official theme , reform conservatism’s liberal critics , I want to discuss a recent column from my colleague Thomas Edsall that , without mentioning our quasi-movement by name , raises one of the sharpest objections to our program of any left-of-center piece I’ve seen . Where reform conservatives tend to argue for a welfare system and tax code organized more explicitly around work and family , Edsall’s piece makes the case that we’ve already tried something like that approach — have been trying it , in fact , since the early 1990s — and that it has worked out pretty badly , failing completely at its stated work-promoting aims while making life increasingly desperate for the very poor .He has in mind the series of policy shifts , from welfare reform to the earned-income tax credit , that have increased the percentage of safety-net spending going to working Americans and decreased the share going the non-working poor . These policies , he acknowledges , “have subsidized the earnings of millions of low-income workers , particularly of married couples with children , pushing them above the official poverty line.” But if “the question is how successful these changes have been in getting poor people into the work force , then the answer is not very , ” since labor force participation fell sharply for the poor between 1990 and 2012 . And the people who don’t benefit from these changes , he writes — especially “destitute , childless men” and non-working single mothers with kids — have become “the casualties of the rightward shift in the war on poverty.”These are serious arguments , which is why I’m going to recommend this more detailed response from the Manhattan Institution’s Scott Winship ( author of the chapter on poverty in the recent “Room to Grow” collection ) and then borrow/steal some of his points for my own gloss on these issues .Let’s start that gloss with Edsall’s description of the trend in workforce participation since anti-poverty spending took a more pro-work turn:In 1990 , 50.2 percent of all adults between the ages of 18 and 64 with incomes below the official poverty level did not work ; 39.8 percent of poor men did not work ; and 56.9 percent of poor women did not work .By 2012 , the percentage of poor people who did not work had grown substantially . In 2012 , 59.7 percent of all poor adults between the ages of 18 and 64 did not work . Among poor men in 2012 , 56.7 percent did not work , a 16.9 percentage point increase . For women in 2012 , 62.0 percent did not work , a 5.1 percentage point increase .So , two points about this analysis . First , the 1990-versus-2012 comparison implies that we’re talking about a steady two-decade-long decline , when it fact there might be nothing steady or consistent about it ; instead , the 2012 figure might be influenced much more by the Great Recession and its aftermath than by any of the policy shifts in the preceding 15-20 years . Second , as Winship points out , looking at the share of poor people who work is a potentially misleading way to assess the impact a policy intended to lift people who do work out of poverty : The policy could be entirely successful and , precisely because it lifts working Americans above the poverty line , could shrink the workforce participation rate for the population that remains below . ( Indeed , Winship notes , “the most successful work promotion policy possible would result in 100 percent of the poverty population consisting of non-working families.” )So it’s useful , with those points in mind , to both look at the entire trend in workforce participation over time ( rather than just at two specific years ) , and to look not at Americans below the poverty line but at , say , Americans without a college diploma — a category whose composition wouldn’t change if the incomes of people within in it were to increase .If you look at the numbers that way , you’ll see a workforce participation rate for the less-educated that was relatively stable ( a little higher in the late 1990s , a little lower thereafter ) from Bill Clinton’s election up to 2007 , at which point it dropped off and has not recovered yet . Which suggests , in turn , that while it’s fair to say that existing “workfare” policies have proven insufficient to the challenges of our recent crash-plus-stagnation , their track record at keeping less-educated Americans in the workforce across the last two decades is better — a lot better , arguably — than a quick look at Edsall’s numbers would suggest .Then there is the question of what’s happened to poverty rates , period , as the safety net has come to lay a stronger stress on work . Citing a paper that found rising rates of extreme poverty in the United States between 1996 and 2011 , Edsall argues that shifting anti-poverty policy toward workfare and income supports has had “devastating” results for the very poor . But if you look at one of the other papers he cites shows , you’ll see ( in Figure 2 ) the overall poverty rate falling sharply after that shift , from above 2o percent in the early 1990s — when , again , many of the changes he’s criticizing were made — to 15 percent across the 2000s . ( It’s risen sightly since , but even post-Great Recession it’s still lower than it was before welfare reform , the earned-income tax credit , and the rest . ) Likewise , as Winship points out , the child poverty rate fell faster after welfare reform than it did before : You can see this by looking at the same Edsall-cited paper , whose estimates ( in Figure 8 ) show a child poverty rate that was close to 30 percent in 1993 and hasn’t broken 20 percent since 1998 .Now it’s certainly possible that these general gains coexist with worsening circumstances for some people at the very bottom ( though Winship has a fairly-persuasive critique of the extreme-poverty paper’s results as well ) . But even if that were a problem , it might be better addressed by streamlining the way benefits are delivered to the very poor — substituting the kind of universal credit idea that Paul Ryan has floated , for instance , for the current array of vouchers and hard-to-navigate bureaucracies — than by rolling back the system’s broader emphasis on work . And the big picture story here — solid post-transfer reductions in poverty for adults and children alike — still seems mostly like a case for the pro-work policy shift , rather than a study in how a rich society has allegedly given up on the bottom of the income ladder .With these points in mind , I would propose a somewhat different narrative than Edsall of how “the rightward shift in the war on poverty” has played out . Since the 1970s , this narrative would run , policymakers have confronted an array of trends — stagnating wages , splintering family structures , social breakdown , cycle , rinse , repeat — that have threatened to create not only a permanent underclass but a non-working , permanently-dependent working class . The pro-work reforms that my colleague describes were , in the 1990s and 2000s , at least moderately successful at pushing back against these trends : They did not arrest every negative trajectory ( marriage’s decline continued , albeit somewhat more slowly in the ’90s ) , but they helped to keep low-wage workers attached to the workforce , while lifting a lot of people who would otherwise have been considered the working poor out of official poverty .Today , however , these policies’ beneficial effects are being swamped by the way that the Great Recession has interacted with and exacerbated various underlying socioeconomic trends . And they’re also being undercut by the fact that post-recession public policy increasingly cuts in a less pro-work direction than it did before — because of the understandable post-2008 decision to keep extending unemployment benefits , because of the work disincentives embedded in Obamacare , because other public programs ( Social Security Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income , in particular — read my colleague Nick Kristof on the latter ) have gradually seen their rolls expand to include many able-bodied workforce drop-outs , and some other trends besides .All of which makes this a good time , one could reasonably argue , not to abandon the pro-work shift , but if anything to push it harder — to create some new carrots and combine them with some new sticks , to shear away a few more of the system’s perverse incentives , and to see if we can’t make at least some headway against the post-Great Recession retreat from work , rather than just resigning ourselves to a new normal of subsidized post-employment among the once-working poor .This alternative narrative does include , I should note , an implicit concession to reform conservatism’s critics , right as well as left : Namely , that since we have already been doing versions of some of the things our little movement wants to do , we have a case study in those policies’ limits as well as their potential benefits , and we need to be modest and realistic about how much there is to gain from going further . The problems , social and economic , that a more pro-work , pro-family welfare state would push back against are not going to be “fixed” by wage subsidies or work requirements or universal credits or larger child tax breaks or any other policy you name . They can only be partially mitigated , modestly ameliorated , and the best case for reform conservatism isn’t that it’s in any way salvific : It’s that it might give some struggling Americans a little more space , a little more room , and a slightly stronger incentive to rebuild the kind of stability and resilience that only families and communities can ultimately provide .
AN insidious trend has developed over this past third of a century . A country that experienced shared growth after World War II began to tear apart , so much so that when the Great Recession hit in late 2007 , one could no longer ignore the fissures that had come to define the American economic landscape . How did this “shining city on a hill” become the advanced country with the greatest level of inequality ?One stream of the extraordinary discussion set in motion by Thomas Piketty’s timely , important book , “Capital in the Twenty-First Century , ” has settled on the idea that violent extremes of wealth and income are inherent to capitalism . In this scheme , we should view the decades after World War II — a period of rapidly falling inequality — as an aberration .This is actually a superficial reading of Mr. Piketty’s work , which provides an institutional context for understanding the deepening of inequality over time . Unfortunately , that part of his analysis received somewhat less attention than the more fatalistic-seeming aspects .Over the past year and a half , The Great Divide , a series in The New York Times for which I have served as moderator , has also presented a wide range of examples that undermine the notion that there are any truly fundamental laws of capitalism . The dynamics of the imperial capitalism of the 19th century needn’t apply in the democracies of the 21st . We don’t need to have this much inequality in America .Our current brand of capitalism is an ersatz capitalism . For proof of this go back to our response to the Great Recession , where we socialized losses , even as we privatized gains . Perfect competition should drive profits to zero , at least theoretically , but we have monopolies and oligopolies making persistently high profits . C.E.O.s enjoy incomes that are on average 295 times that of the typical worker , a much higher ratio than in the past , without any evidence of a proportionate increase in productivity .If it is not the inexorable laws of economics that have led to America’s great divide , what is it ? The straightforward answer : our policies and our politics . People get tired of hearing about Scandinavian success stories , but the fact of the matter is that Sweden , Finland and Norway have all succeeded in having about as much or faster growth in per capita incomes than the United States and with far greater equality .So why has America chosen these inequality-enhancing policies ? Part of the answer is that as World War II faded into memory , so too did the solidarity it had engendered . As America triumphed in the Cold War , there didn’t seem to be a viable competitor to our economic model . Without this international competition , we no longer had to show that our system could deliver for most of our citizens .Ideology and interests combined nefariously . Some drew the wrong lesson from the collapse of the Soviet system . The pendulum swung from much too much government there to much too little here . Corporate interests argued for getting rid of regulations , even when those regulations had done so much to protect and improve our environment , our safety , our health and the economy itself .But this ideology was hypocritical . The bankers , among the strongest advocates of laissez-faire economics , were only too willing to accept hundreds of billions of dollars from the government in the bailouts that have been a recurring feature of the global economy since the beginning of the Thatcher-Reagan era of “free” markets and deregulation .The American political system is overrun by money . Economic inequality translates into political inequality , and political inequality yields increasing economic inequality . In fact , as he recognizes , Mr. Piketty’s argument rests on the ability of wealth-holders to keep their after-tax rate of return high relative to economic growth . How do they do this ? By designing the rules of the game to ensure this outcome ; that is , through politics .So corporate welfare increases as we curtail welfare for the poor . Congress maintains subsidies for rich farmers as we cut back on nutritional support for the needy . Drug companies have been given hundreds of billions of dollars as we limit Medicaid benefits . The banks that brought on the global financial crisis got billions while a pittance went to the homeowners and victims of the same banks’ predatory lending practices . This last decision was particularly foolish . There were alternatives to throwing money at the banks and hoping it would circulate through increased lending . We could have helped underwater homeowners and the victims of predatory behavior directly . This would not only have helped the economy , it would have put us on the path to robust recovery .OUR divisions are deep . Economic and geographic segregation have immunized those at the top from the problems of those down below . Like the kings of yore , they have come to perceive their privileged positions essentially as a natural right . How else to explain the recent comments of the venture capitalist Tom Perkins , who suggested that criticism of the 1 percent was akin to Nazi fascism , or those coming from the private equity titan Stephen A. Schwarzman , who compared asking financiers to pay taxes at the same rate as those who work for a living to Hitler’s invasion of Poland .Our economy , our democracy and our society have paid for these gross inequities . The true test of an economy is not how much wealth its princes can accumulate in tax havens , but how well off the typical citizen is — even more so in America where our self-image is rooted in our claim to be the great middle-class society . But median incomes are lower than they were a quarter-century ago . Growth has gone to the very , very top , whose share has almost quadrupled since 1980 . Money that was meant to have trickled down has instead evaporated in the balmy climate of the Cayman Islands .With almost a quarter of American children younger than 5 living in poverty , and with America doing so little for its poor , the deprivations of one generation are being visited upon the next . Of course , no country has ever come close to providing complete equality of opportunity . But why is America one of the advanced countries where the life prospects of the young are most sharply determined by the income and education of their parents ?Among the most poignant stories in The Great Divide were those that portrayed the frustrations of the young , who yearn to enter our shrinking middle class . Soaring tuitions and declining incomes have resulted in larger debt burdens . Those with only a high school diploma have seen their incomes decline by 13 percent over the past 35 years .Where justice is concerned , there is also a yawning divide . In the eyes of the rest of the world and a significant part of its own population , mass incarceration has come to define America — a country , it bears repeating , with about 5 percent of the world’s population but around a fourth of the world’s prisoners .Justice has become a commodity , affordable to only a few . While Wall Street executives used their high-retainer lawyers to ensure that their ranks were not held accountable for the misdeeds that the crisis in 2008 so graphically revealed , the banks abused our legal system to foreclose on mortgages and evict people , some of whom did not even owe money .More than a half-century ago , America led the way in advocating for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , adopted by the United Nations in 1948 . Today , access to health care is among the most universally accepted rights , at least in the advanced countries . America , despite the implementation of the Affordable Care Act , is the exception . It has become a country with great divides in access to health care , life expectancy and health status .In the relief that many felt when the Supreme Court did not overturn the Affordable Care Act , the implications of the decision for Medicaid were not fully appreciated . Obamacare’s objective — to ensure that all Americans have access to health care — has been stymied : 24 states have not implemented the expanded Medicaid program , which was the means by which Obamacare was supposed to deliver on its promise to some of the poorest .We need not just a new war on poverty but a war to protect the middle class . Solutions to these problems do not have to be newfangled . Far from it . Making markets act like markets would be a good place to start . We must end the rent-seeking society we have gravitated toward , in which the wealthy obtain profits by manipulating the system .The problem of inequality is not so much a matter of technical economics . It’s really a problem of practical politics . Ensuring that those at the top pay their fair share of taxes — ending the special privileges of speculators , corporations and the rich — is both pragmatic and fair . We are not embracing a politics of envy if we reverse a politics of greed . Inequality is not just about the top marginal tax rate but also about our children’s access to food and the right to justice for all . If we spent more on education , health and infrastructure , we would strengthen our economy , now and in the future . Just because you’ve heard it before doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try it again .We have located the underlying source of the problem : political inequities and policies that have commodified and corrupted our democracy . It is only engaged citizens who can fight to restore a fairer America , and they can do so only if they understand the depths and dimensions of the challenge . It is not too late to restore our position in the world and recapture our sense of who we are as a nation . Widening and deepening inequality is not driven by immutable economic laws , but by laws we have written ourselves .This is the last article in The Great Divide .
How do institutions change their practices ? In medicine , the usual answer is “slowly.” Clinical trials can show the efficacy of a new practice — yet , decades later , many physicians still haven’t gotten the message .Until four years ago , it seemed like early elective delivery was a textbook example of evidence widely ignored . These are induced or cesarean section deliveries after 37 completed weeks but before 39 completed weeks of gestation , when not medically necessary . The reason is usually convenience — the family is coming in for Christmas or the obstetrician will be off next week .Delivery at 37 or 38 weeks was widely considered benign — but it is not . Infant mortality is at least 50 percent higher for babies at 37 or 38 weeks than at 39 or 40 ( at 41 weeks the rate rises again ) . These babies are also more likely to suffer breathing , feeding and developmental problems .The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists had been warning against early elective delivery since 1979 . The March of Dimes , one of the most respected advocacy groups in America , had long campaigned to discourage the practice . Reducing these deliveries shouldn’t have been hard — at least , they should have been easier to change than many other harmful practices . For one thing , a reduction in these deliveries saves money . An elective C-section costs a lot more than letting the baby choose the birth date . And fewer early deliveries mean fewer babies in the neonatal intensive care unit — one of the most expensive rooms in the hospital . ( Average charge : $ 76,000 , according to the March of Dimes ( pdf ) . )Another advantage was that the practice was clearly defined — there was relatively little debate about what “medically necessary” means . The message from advocacy groups and medical societies was unified and unambiguous . Nor were the steps needed to reduce such deliveries complex : hospitals could simply bar them unless a doctor could show medical necessity . This is rare for safety improvements . Bringing down infection rates , for example , requires an entire hospital work force to adopt time-consuming new behaviors and routines .Despite the expert warnings , nothing happened . In 2010 , these deliveries accounted for 17 percent of births . In some states , such as South Carolina , they represented more than a quarter of all deliveries .But 2010 began a vertiginous drop , according to a survey of hospitals released last week by The Leapfrog Group , an organization funded by businesses that are large purchasers of health care to work for quality and safety improvement . Last year the national average was down to 4.6 percent — a fall of 73 percent in three years . “In health care , we talk about a 1 to 2 percent change as spectacular — wow , we’ve really improved , ” said Leah Binder , the president and chief executive of The Leapfrog Group . “I have never in my career seen anything like the progress we’re seeing on early elective deliveries.”Something happened in 2010 that didn’t happen before with these deliveries — and doesn’t happen with other harmful practices . And that something may offer important clues to how to speed things up elsewhere .* Models for change . Elliott Main teaches obstetrics and gynecology at Stanford University and is medical director of the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative . He’s studied the drop in early elective deliveries , and said that the spark for it most likely came from a pair of articles published in the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology in 2009 . They described programs in a hospital in Pennsylvania and a group of hospitals in Utah that produced dramatic reductions in early elective deliveries . “Those certainly made everybody sit up and say , yes we can improve obstetric care , ” said Main . “It showed there was a pressure point that was reducible.”* Measurement . In 2010 , the Leapfrog Group began asking hospitals to report early elective deliveries . About 750 hospitals , accounting for about half the births in the United States , complied . The rates they found shocked a lot of people . “Even hospitals themselves didn’t know they themselves have high rates , ” said Binder . “I can’t tell you how many medical directors called me and said , ‘this can’t be right.’”The hospitals Leapfrog count reported voluntarily , which means there could be some selection bias . But in 2013 , the government’s Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services — which under this administration has introduced glasnost to health care statistics — began requiring hospitals to report . The data coming in is consistent with Leapfrog’s . The Joint Commission , an influential nonprofit that accredits hospitals , also recently began including this measure .Measuring and publicizing rates of early elective delivery has helped in several ways . It revealed the dimensions of the problem . It tells hospitals how they are doing . It allows patients to choose safer hospitals , which exerts pressure for more safety . And it creates the basis for reimbursing hospitals in a way that discourages these deliveries .* Payment reform . The pioneers have been Texas and South Carolina . Texas in 2011 barred Medicaid ( that’s a state program ; Medicare is federal ) , which pays for 55 percent of births , from reimbursing hospitals for early elective deliveries .In 2011 , South Carolina began the Birth Outcomes Initiative , a program designed to reduce prematurity , increase breast-feeding and make other changes for healthier babies . Those were not the only goals . Medicaid spending accounted for more than a quarter of the entire state budget . “We were looking to improve health outcomes and at the same time reduce our cost , ” said Melanie Giese , the program’s director . The state’s 43 hospitals that did births came together and signed a pledge to reduce these deliveries .Tony Keck , the state’s health and human services director , announced that if the voluntary effort was insufficient , the state would stop reimbursing hospitals for these deliveries . The only payments that South Carolina’s government directly controlled were Medicaid ones . But the state was unusual in that its commercial market was dominated by one huge insurer : Blue Cross Blue Shield . Between them , Medicaid and Blue Cross covered 85 percent of the state’s births . So when Blue Cross agreed to go along , hospitals listened . “Even the hint that payment reform was coming meant that hospitals put that on the top of their priority list , ” said Binder .Every hospital appointed one person to lead the drive to stop early elective deliveries . There were — still are — monthly meetings attended by more than 100 people . Each meeting begins with a success story from an individual hospital . Then attendees go to work on specific strategies and tactics . ( For details see this case study by the group Catalyst for Payment Reform . )A year later , there was good progress , but South Carolina had started with one of the country’s highest rates , and officials worried that progress had reached a plateau . Keck announced that the state would cut off payments the next year . The state’s program gradually prepared hospitals to make the switch .On Jan. 1 , 2013 , payments stopped . Data from that quarter shows that early elective inductions dropped by more than 45 percent since 2011 . ( Since reasons for C-sections are harder to collect and interpret , the state doesn’t have good data for the program’s effects on early elective C-sections . ) NICU admissions were down . The state saved $ 6 million that quarter — 25 percent of it from cheaper deliveries and 75 percent from fewer NICU admissions .South Carolina is the only state to halt reimbursements from Medicaid and private insurers . “It’s important to have the all-payer approach , ” said Main . “Medicaid doesn’t pay very much for births . Doctors are much more sensitive to what commercial plans pay.” The state is now a national model . “We’ve talked to 20 different states who have called us and asked how we did it , ” said Giese .The federal government is also starting to reform payments for early elective deliveries — through Medicare . It might seem odd that Medicare has anything to say about this issue . ( How many 65-year-olds have babies ? ) But Medicare does pay for some births , to disabled women . More to the point , it’s the big stick , accounting for 35 to 55 percent of hospitals’ revenue . Medicare is now linking 1.25 percent of its reimbursement to how well hospitals score on a basket of safety measures . Now that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services requires hospitals to report early elective deliveries , that measure is likely to be added to the basket next year .Medicare reimburses hospitals less than commercial payers do , so even 1.25 percent can determine whether a hospital breaks even on Medicare or not . Still , it could be a lot more — the bigger the percentage , the more hospitals will prioritize safety .One argument for raising the percentage is that it has to be big enough to make up for revenue lost due to healthier babies . NICUs are a major profit center for hospitals . Main said some hospitals complained that when they cracked down on early elective deliveries , their NICU revenues dropped . “People don’t want to complain about that publicly , ” he said . ( Those who do should fire their P.R . advisers ; those who complain even in private need some serious soul-searching . ) “They know that at the end of the day . But they’re still trying to take care of their bottom line.”* Collaboration . Transparency and payment reform create incentive for change . But they are not a strategy . South Carolina created a strategy through its monthly meetings to share and support best practices . Obamacare is trying to do something similar across the country with two programs . Partnership for Patients funds and supports networks of hospitals to improve safety . These networks get hospitals to agree to standards , provide model policies , training , technical assistance and monitoring . And Strong Start funds hospitals as they test ways to reduce early elective deliveries and spread those practices .What was most important in reducing early elective deliveries ? All these pieces together . Plus strong public advocacy , good tools to help hospitals improve quality , and local leadership . “Many improvement efforts don’t get such a good response because they’re approached from one dimension or direction , ” said Main . “It really comes down to having multiple different strategies at the same time.”Note : An earlier version of this article got the name of The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists wrong .

Back in May , I offered some general comments on the question of communion for divorced and remarried Catholics — which looms over the Synod on the Family scheduled for this autumn in Rome , and may represent one of the defining controversies of Pope Francis’s pontificate — and then wrote what was intended to be the first of two posts addressing Cardinal Walter Kasper’s high-profile case for admitting the remarried to the sacrament . That post offered theological and sociological reasons to be skeptical of Kasper’s broad suggestion , offered in an interview with the editors of Commonweal , that Catholic marriage generally is in a crisis more severe even than divorce statistics would suggest , in which ( he argued ) possibly as many as half of all Catholic marriages are actually invalid . The second post , which I promised and then didn’t deliver , was supposed to be a detailed response to his specific proposal on communion , which he first presented in remarks to his fellow cardinals in the winter and then elaborated again in the Commonweal interview this spring .Now I’m going to try to finally deliver that response — but in a slightly different form than I originally envisioned , because there’s a new critical assessment of Kasper’s argument , written by a group of American Dominicans , that covers the theological and historical issues in much greater detail and with a far deeper grounding in the relevant material than anything I’m likely to write here . Readers interested in the the subject — whether as Catholics or Christians or simply because they want to understand why the adoption of Kasper’s proposal could lead to an internal crisis in the life of the planet’s largest religious body — should really turn to that assessment first . Readers interested in my own , more non-expert thoughts , meanwhile , can forge ahead . ( And readers who think I’m returning to this subject on this particular week because I can’t come up with a clear opinion on the latest Obamacare debate should turn to my spokesman , Francis Urquhart , for a definitive response . )Here , then , is Kasper’s original explanation of how communion for divorced and remarried Catholics , in the absence of an annulment declaring their previous marriage invalid , might be made available , and why:The question that confronts us is this : Is this path beyond rigorism and laxity , the path of conversion , which issues forth in the sacrament of mercy—the sacrament of penance—also the path that we can follow in this matter ? Certainly not in every case . But if a divorced and remarried person is truly sorry that he or she failed in the first marriage , if the commitments from the first marriage are clarified and a return is definitively out of the question , if he or she can not undo the commitments that were assumed in the second civil marriage without new guilt , if he or she strives to the best of his or her abilities to live out the second civil marriage on the basis of faith and to raise their children in the faith , if he or she longs for the sacraments as a source of strength in his or her situation , do we then have to refuse or can we refuse him or her the sacrament of penance and communion , after a period of reorientation ?The path in question would not be a general solution . It is not a broad path for the great masses , but a narrow path for the indeed smaller segment of divorced and remarried individuals who are honestly interested in the sacraments . Is it not necessary precisely here to prevent something worse ? For when children in the families of the divorced and remarried never see their parents go to the sacraments , then they too normally will not find their way to confession and communion . Do we then accept as a consequence that we will also lose the next generation and perhaps the generation after that ? Does not our well-preserved praxis then become counterproductive ?In this passage and elsewhere , Kasper casts his proposal as above all a practical measure — a middle way between “rigorism” and “laxism , ” a means of saving future generations for the church , a response to a reality that certain levels of spiritual and moral “heroism” are simply “not for the average Christian , ” and a proposal that would be strictly limited to a very small “segment” of the divorced and remarried . The theological issues at stake , the potential conflict with the church’s traditional teaching , are consistently downplayed and/or brushed aside ; the implication is always that we are talking about an exception that in no way threatens the official , gospel-grounded rule .So let’s talk about the practicalities of that exception for a moment . It’s important to note that what Kasper is proposing differs from a scenario in which individual pastors might decide on their own initiative to give communion to the remarried , or where remarried Catholics who are morally convinced that their first marriages were invalid , but who haven’t managed to obtain an annulment , might decide to find a parish where they can act on that conviction and receive the eucharist . Both those possibilities already exist , insofar as the church is huge , diverse , complicated and neither a police state nor ( as Kasper says ) a community of perfectly heroic saints : The formal teaching barring the remarried from communion coexists , inevitably , with individual choices that contravene the rule , and in the Western world especially many Catholics looking for straightforward laxity can very easily find what they are seeking .What Kasper is recommending is something different : Not a certain degree of tolerance for deviations from the rule , but formal permission to abandon it — granted by an official body of the church , with a papal imprimatur , and eventually with , presumably , a formal structure ( say X prayers , wait X weeks , etc . ) that individuals and pastors could follow and adopt .So the first question to ask is why , once this new structure is in place , we should realistically expect it to be limited to “a smaller segment of divorced and remarried individuals , ” rather than being extended to the “great masses” fairly quickly ?Consider that right now the church already has a procedure , the annulment process , that is effectively limited to people who have a stronger-than-average interest in receiving the sacraments after divorcing and marrying again . Suppose that you institute , alongside this procedure , a second path to reception of communion , which involves no paperwork , no tribunals , no difficult family issues or ex-spouse interactions , no long wait with an uncertain outcome at the end . The first , almost-inevitable consequence , it seems to me , would be that many , many people who might otherwise have done so would simply stop applying for annulments and follow this path instead . Yes , under Kasper’s proposals , second marriages still wouldn’t be blessed by the church , so there would be some Catholics seeking the validation of their second union who would go down the annulment path … but there would be a lot more ( based on my own sense of what I might do in that position , frankly ) who would say , “well , maybe someday , but for now it’s too much , too hard …” and take the Kasper door instead .So annulment applications would largely collapse , and most people currently seeking them would simply turn to their local pastor for relief instead . Then at the same time , you would have a far larger population — as large , potentially , as the pool of divorced-and-remarried Catholics who currently show up at Christmas , Easter , and rarely in between — who would never really contemplate going through the annulment process as it currently exists , but who would see the new rubric as an alternative much better suited to their lives and situations . ( Indeed , I would have assumed that the appeal to this “great mass” of semi-lapsed Catholics would represent a feature rather than a bug for advocates of Kasper’s proposal — a way to bring the lapsed and drifting home , to make it easier , as the cardinal suggests , to raise their children Catholic , to boost mass attendance and sacramental participation overall , and so on . )Now in theory pastors could throw up obstacles to requests from this larger group , could work every case extremely carefully , and could substantially limit the number of people going down this path . ( You may receive , a priest might say , but you seem insufficiently contrite about your first marriage’s failure and/or insufficiently sincere in your practice of faith , and so you may not … ) But this places an awfully heavy burden on an already-burdened clergy , and it’s much more likely that the pattern with most post-1960s changes to traditional Catholic practice ( from , say , the allowance for taking communion in the hand to the permission for cremation at Catholic funerals ) would play itself out once again : A rhetoric of modesty and pastoral discretion and careful implementation , followed by a swift normalization ( or near-universalization ) of the new rule or approach . Not in every parish or diocese , no doubt , but in enough of them to establish a new pattern , a widespread and generally-accepted norm .So by design , then , rather than by accident , Kasper’s approach would almost certainly create a situation in which almost all divorced Catholics could reasonably expect to be able to remarry and resume the reception of the eucharist with the formal blessing of the church . This would , as Kasper says , probably strengthen some Catholics’ attachment to the church and the sacraments , and give some Catholic children of remarried parents a stronger connection to the life of the faith than they have today . But it would also have other effects as well . Those children of the divorced and remarried that Kasper references would , indeed , be more likely to see their parents going to communion , but they would also be more likely to think that their church did not , in the end , regard marriage as actually as indissoluble , or the words of Jesus on the subject as actually as binding , as Roman Catholicism has heretofore believed and taught . And so would other Catholic married couples , and their children , and others , both within the church and without . ( Especially since it’s very clear how such a change would be portrayed in media accounts , where the language of exceptional cases and narrow segments would be regarded — again , I think , correctly — as far less significant than the change itself . )Right now , at least in the United States , there is still a “Catholic difference” on divorce : Overall , Catholic divorce rates are lower than the rates for the secular and for other religious groups ; among couples who marry young , divorce rates among practicing Catholics are substantially lower than rates for other churchgoing Christians ; and then among self-identified Catholics , sacramental marriages are much less likely to dissolve than non-sacramental , civil marriages . Would this difference survive the transformation in church practice that would likely follow the adoption of Kasper’s proposal , and the change in church teaching strongly implied ( with , again , its implications amplified in the secular culture ) by that proposal’s practical effects ? Maybe : Social and religious trends are , yes , quite complicated and difficult to perfectly predict . But the record of similar changes in other Christian churches is not exactly encouraging on this count , and the “contagious” pattern of family breakdown likewise offers a reason to be sharply pessimistic .So again sticking to practicalities rather than dogmatics , it’s worth asking a rather sharp question : what kind of increase in the Catholic divorce rate would advocates of Kasper’s proposal consider an acceptable cost to set against the benefit of bringing some remarried Catholics and their children back into the church ?*Then there are the questions that follow from the underlying moral logic of the proposal , which would seem , in my reading at least , to have broader applications than Kasper’s modest language allows .The argument , as offered , is that the church should hesitate before asking remarried Catholics who have made serious commitments to their new spouses and possibly to children to put those commitments at risk by trying to live chastely , and incur the guilt of obligations unmet and promises unfulfilled . Again , setting aside certain theological issues , one can concede this argument’s potency while wondering about its limiting principle . Why , for instance , would the obligations of a second marriage need to be accommodated by the church , and not the obligations of a polygamous marriage — where similar promises are made , and children are just as ( if not more ) likely to be involved ?Polygamy is not of course a major issue in Kasper’s Germany or in the United States ( though cases certainly exist ) , but it is very much a major issue in Africa , the church’s more important mission field , and a continent where the definition of marriage is hotly contested , not between Christianity and liberalism , but between Christianity and Islam . Is there anything in Kasper’s proposal that would not imply the necessity — or at least the plausibility — of a similar accommodation for spouses in a vowed polygamous union ? Indeed , surely women in polygamous marriages in traditional cultures are in a much more difficult position than men or women in a second marriage in the West — their legal rights more limited , their economic freedom more circumscribed , their ability to break away without losing contact with their children much more constrained . If the church does not ask “heroism” of remarried Catholics in rich countries , how can it possibly take a strong line against polygamy in contexts where , for someone already tied to such a union , trying to be faithful to the church’s teaching on marriage can exact a far , far higher cost ?This is not a slippery-slope argument ; it’s just a straightforward application of the principle being invoked . The slippery-slope argument would encompass still other unions : For instance , if the church can not reasonably call the divorced-and-remarried to continence , by what legitimate grounds can it call same-sex-attracted Catholics to that state — especially gay Catholics in same-sex unions who might be rearing children together , like the remarried couples Kasper invokes ? If the church , in his words , can find a way to formally “tolerate” what is “in itself … unacceptable” in the case of a mode of living specifically condemned by Jesus himself , why can’t it similarly tolerate a mode of life that doesn’t involve adultery or the breaking of an existing marriage ?And then there is the further example that the cardinal himself seems to raise , in the following Commonweal exchange:CWL : So , just to be clear , when you talk about a divorced and remarried Catholic not being able to fulfill the rigorist’s requirements without incurring a new guilt , what would he or she be guilty of ?Kasper : The breakup of the second family . If there are children you can not do it . If you’re engaged to a new partner , you’ve given your word , and so it’s not possible .Now perhaps ( I would say probably ) there is an English-as-second-language issue here , and Kasper meant “engaged” as in already civilly married , and not engaged as in merely affianced . But the latter example still raises an interesting point : In a society filled with cohabitation and de facto step-parenting and all the rest , many people make promises and incur obligations to their partners and children long before they enter into a civil marriage , and the “guilt” that Kasper wants to avoid imposing could be felt in many different situations . You can imagine a scenario , under his logic , where a pastor might feel obliged — because there are promises involved , or kids , or other obligations — to hesitate before insisting that a divorced , not-yet-remarried Catholic live chastely , or before urging him to break off his engagement rather than following through on his intention to marry again . And then of course beyond that the scenario of simple nonmarital cohabitation rears its head : If you have a child with a man , say , and he doesn’t want a Catholic wedding , or to marry at all , but is content to live with you and be a father to your children , under Kasper’s logic isn’t it better for the kids to have their dad around and to see you taking communion ? If what Jesus calls adultery can be tolerable for the church , can not some nonmarital pairings claim the same sort of mercy ? But only a “small segment , ” of course …*Now I know that for many readers , teasing out these implications makes Kasper’s proposal seem that much more reasonable and admirable , because in their view the Catholic Church desperately needs a way to evolve toward the norms of “sexual modernity” ( on same-sex marriage , especially , but other fronts as well ) . And if this is the entering wedge for that kind of change , well , then so much the better .That’s a perfectly understandable perspective ( about which I hope to say more , in a slightly different form , soon ) . All I’m arguing here is that it needs to be forthrightly acknowledged , rather than hidden away as a kind of footnote to what is officially presented as a small pastoral change . That right or wrong , good or evil , merciful or destructive , the Kasper proposal is not a minor tweak to Catholic discipline : It’s a depth charge , a change pregnant with further changes , an alteration that could have far more sweeping consequences than innovations ( married priests ; female cardinals ) that might seem more radical on their face .For reasons of theology , sociology , and simple logic , admitting the remarried to communion has the potential to transform not only Catholic teaching and Catholic life , but the church’s very self-understanding . These are the real stakes in this controversy ; these are the terms , here and in Rome , on which it needs to be debated .
