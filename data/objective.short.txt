( Reuters ) - A few U.S. states whose newly created Obamacare insurance exchanges were stalled by technology failures may join the federal government 's HealthCare.gov marketplace for next year , while only two states that relied on the administration plan to go it alone .Exchange officials in Oregon , Maryland and Massachusetts are weighing whether to enlist new private technology contractors or to turn to the federal government after faulty exchanges slowed enrollment in their states to the lowest rates in the country .The reshuffle would mean the federal government would continue to remain responsible for enrolling millions of people in coverage under President Barack Obama 's healthcare law in most of the country next year , a far cry from its goal of independent marketplaces in all 50 states .Of the 36 states that signed up residents via HealthCare.gov for 2014 , Idaho and New Mexico say they will run their own online enrollment for 2015 , according to spokespeople in those states . Enrollment for next year begins in November .Political opposition to the law in many states prevented the creation of more state-based exchanges and has continued to threaten the program . Republicans have sought to defund it , even shutting down the government last year in an attempt to do so .`` I do n't have any indication that the feds are pushing back , except I know that it has to be in their interest to have the states running as many state marketplaces as possible , '' said Linda Blumberg , a health economist at the Urban Institute .Blumberg drew a distinction between states like Idaho , which relied on the federal government solely for its technology platform but oversaw bigger aspects of its marketplace , including enrollment outreach and regulation of the insurance plans sold in the state . Other states using HealthCare.gov have left oversight of virtually their entire marketplace to the Department of Health and Human Services .`` I think they 'd be very happy if Illinois became a state-based marketplace , but I do n't think it has to do necessarily with the IT system , '' she said , referring to a state that has relied on the federal government for more than technology .The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services , the U.S. government agency responsible for overseeing the exchanges , did not have an immediate comment on the possible moves .`` CMS is committed to providing technical assistance and feedback to state-based marketplaces , '' CMS spokesman Aaron Albright said . `` We are working closely with states to support their efforts to successfully implement their marketplace . ''EXCHANGE IN A BOXState-run exchanges have a few options to consider for fixing their problems before turning to the federal government .Connecticut , a state whose exchange worked mostly smoothly in the first year of Obamacare enrollment , has had discussions with five states about selling its technology as an `` exchange in a box , '' the head of its exchange said . It could handle an entire exchange , or just do the back-office work of calculating government subsidies for individual Obamacare plans and sending transaction forms to insurers .`` States pretty much have to make a decision now , '' Kevin Counihan , Access Health CT chief executive officer , said earlier this month .Beyond 2015 , the picture starts to blur . Arkansas and Illinois are considering building their own exchanges but have no definite plans for 2016 .`` It is somewhat unclear whether more states will move in the direction of running their own marketplaces , '' said Jennifer Tolbert , director of state health reform at the Kaiser Family Foundation . `` We may need a little more time for things to settle out . ''States that are already using HealthCare.gov , which started off severely hobbled by technology problems , have a reason to stay now that it is working well enough , she said . As many as 6 million people are expected to sign up by the time 2014 enrollment ends on March 31 , with the number surging to 22 million by 2016 .States that run their own marketplaces receive hundreds of millions of dollars in startup money from the federal government to build the exchanges , but after that they bear the financial responsibility and must prove they can operate at a self-sustaining level within a short time .Idaho and New Mexico had always intended to run their own exchanges but were caught short in planning and last spring said the federal government would sell their plans on HealthCare.gov . Both states have contracted with small , privately held Silicon Valley technology firm GetInsured to build their individual state marketplaces in time for 2015 . The company also runs an online health insurance marketplace , Getinsured.com .In Hawaii , a state whose exchange technology did not work for many months , keeping enrollment to a trickle , officials said the state would stay the course as a stand-alone exchange .Hawaii is not considering the Connecticut offering or moving to the federal marketplace , since its exchange has been constructed to meet the requirements of its state health laws , spokesman Bobby Lambrix said in a statement .If Oregon , Massachusetts or Maryland decide on a federal option , it is likely to be just technology and not a wholesale shift , said Chad Shearer , deputy director of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundations ' state health reform assistance network .`` It 's almost as hard to go the federally facilitated marketplace as it is to fix what they 've got , '' he said . `` I think states are interested in using pieces of the ( federal ) technology .

( Reuters ) - A gay couple in Ohio filed a federal lawsuit on Tuesday , charging they were unable to obtain family coverage under President Barack Obama 's healthcare reform law because the state of Ohio does not recognize their same-sex marriage .The plaintiffs , Alfred Cowger and Anthony Wesley of Gates Mills , Ohio , have been together since 1986 and were married in New York state in 2012 , six years after adopting a daughter , according to the suit filed in U.S. District Court in Ohio .The suit names the U.S. government and the state of Ohio as defendants , charging they violated the plaintiffs ' constitutional rights by refusing to recognize their married status , thereby preventing them from enrolling in family coverage under the Affordable Care Act , commonly known as Obamacare .The plaintiffs said they had been covered under the same policy for the past 15 years , which included their recognition as `` domestic partners . '' Their daughter also became covered under their policy at the time they were granted custody in 2006 .After the family moved to the Cleveland area from Pennsylvania in 2010 , the three were covered under the same non-group family health insurance policy purchased from Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Ohio .With Cowger starting to scale back his law practice in early 2013 and Wesley retired from his job as a chief financial officer , the couple faced reduced income and became interested in family coverage under the Affordable Care Act .After initially being unable to enroll in Obamacare because of glitches involving the troubled rollout of the healthcare.gov website , they said in the suit that they were assured by Anthem they could remain under its policy after December 2013 , although premiums would increase by about 20 percent .But in November , according to the suit , Cowger said he received a letter from Anthem stating their policy `` was to be terminated because it was not in compliance with the ACA . ''A new family policy with Anthem would cost about twice their existing one , or about half the family 's joint income , and not be eligible for tax credits under Obamacare .'NOT DEEMED VALID 'Cowger said he returned to the ACA marketplace and logged some 100 hours trying to obtain family coverage . He said in the suit he was repeatedly told by marketplace representatives that he and his spouse should be able to obtain a family policy because they were legally married in New York and planned to file a joint 2013 tax return .`` However , each time , Cowger would ultimately be told that it was determined that plaintiffs could not purchase a family policy since their legal marriage in New York , recognized as valid for federal tax purposes , was not deemed valid to obtain a family policy under the ACA , '' the suit said .Ultimately facing the loss of all health coverage at the end of 2013 , Cowger and Wesley were forced to obtain separate individual health insurance policies from the marketplace , their lawsuit said .The inability of Cowger and Wesley to get family coverage under Obamacare created further complications that also ultimately required them to get a separate policy for their daughter , the suit said .`` As a result , the Cowger-Wesley family went from one family policy in 2013 to three different individual policies , '' it added .Ohio state officials could not immediately be reached for comment .U.S. Health and Human Services spokeswoman Joanne Peters said in a statement : `` We are aware that same-sex married couples in some states are experiencing issues in obtaining family plans and ( are ) looking into ways to address this issue for the 2015 plan year . ''`` While we work to address this situation , same-sex married couples can use their tax credit to buy individual policies for each spouse if they are unable to obtain a family plan in their current state , '' she said .( Reporting by Peter Cooney , editing by G Crosse )
( Reuters ) - A stand-off between Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana and the federal government over healthcare coverage for people with HIV-AIDS escalated on Monday , as a gay-rights group filed a legal complaint against the insurer , which reiterated a policy at odds with federal regulations .Lambda Legal , a non-profit that works for the civil rights of gay people and others , filed an administrative complaint against Louisiana Blue , saying the company 's stance `` violates critical non-discrimination provisions of the Affordable Care Act '' or ACA , President Barack Obama 's healthcare reform law .Reuters reported on Saturday that hundreds of people with HIV/AIDS in Louisiana who purchased health insurance under the ACA are at risk of being thrown out of the plans they selected . The customers had paid their premiums with funds from a federal program that , for 23 years , has subsidized insurance for people with HIV-AIDS , but Louisiana Blue Cross said it would not accept those checks because any third-party payments opened the door to fraud .Over the weekend , the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , the lead Obamacare agency , issued stronger guidance on whether insurers must accept payments from the 1990 Ryan White Act program . CMS said it is considering going beyond `` encouraging '' insurers to accept Ryan White funds to pay for health care plans to `` requiring '' them to do so .On Monday , Louisiana Blue repeated its opposition to accepting payments from the Ryan White program for policies it sells through Healthcare.gov , the Obamacare portal .The insurer has `` received the latest communication '' from CMS , said Louisiana Blue spokesman John Maginnis , but for now `` our policy is that effective March 1 , 2014 , we will only accept individual members ' premium payments from the policyholder , '' or an immediate relative , and `` will no longer accept third-party payments . ''`` There are very few of our individual members who will be affected by this , '' he said .Lucy Cordts of the New Orleans NO/AIDS Task Force , which has been scrambling to help affected Louisiana Blue customers , said several hundred people with HIV-AIDS had used Ryan White payments for their monthly premiums and could be kicked out of the Obamacare plan they purchased .Of the hundreds of people with HIV-AIDS who are trying to use Ryan White Act funds to pay Obamacare insurance premiums , many are too poor to qualify for ACA subsidies , which go to people whose income is 100 percent to 400 percent of the federal poverty level .Those with lower incomes , including many people with HIV-AIDS , were supposed to be covered by Medicaid , the joint federal-state health insurance program for the poor , but Louisiana did not expand the program as the ACA intended so as to make them eligible .Louisiana Blue has cited the need to prevent `` potential fraud , waste and abuse '' as its reason for refusing third-party payments , including those from the government .Healthcare advocates are concerned , however , that the policy is instead an effort to minimize the number of people with HIV-AIDS the company insures .Louisiana Blue `` has the best drug plans for HIV , '' said Moriba Karamoko , director of the Louisiana Consumer Healthcare Coalition , who has been trying to help resolve the impasse . `` They 're the only ones that cover the single-tablet regimen '' prescribed to control HIV ; other plans cover multi-pill HIV treatment , which patients find onerous .`` They 're worried that they 'll end up with everybody '' with HIV-AIDS , said Karamoko .The Lambda Legal complaint , filed with the Office of Civil Rights at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services , CMS 's parent agency , asks the government to investigate the insurer and could lead to a faster resolution than a lawsuit , explained Lambda director of constitutional litigation Susan Sommer .Louisiana Blue 's decision to reject Ryan White payments for the premiums of people with HIV-AIDS `` seems to be an effort to discriminate against people with HIV , '' she said . `` Every day ( the company ) keeps this policy is a day it deters people with HIV from signing up for one of its plans . ''The company said it is aware of the complaint but would not comment further .( This story was refiled to fix typo in headline )( Reporting by Sharon Begley in New York ; Editing by Alden Bentley )
( Reuters ) - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp struck its biggest deal on Monday , acquiring healthcare IT services provider TriZetto Corp for $ 2.7 billion to beef up its slowing healthcare business .Shares of the company , which is buying TriZetto from London-based private equity firm Apax Partners LLP , rose nearly 3 percent in premarket trading .Cognizant 's healthcare business , which accounted for about 26 percent of total revenue in 2013 , has declined in the last three quarters .The company provides services such as claims processing , billing and call center operations to insurers , hospitals and some state-run healthcare exchanges set up under President Barack Obama 's Affordable Care Act , also known as Obamacare .TriZetto provides information technology services , including care management and the administration of benefits . The company said it reaches 245,000 healthcare providers , representing more than half of the insured population in the United States .Englewood , Colorado-based TriZetto is the latest U.S. healthcare IT services provider to be acquired as payers and providers of healthcare seek new ways to cut costs .`` Healthcare is undergoing structural shifts due to reform , cost pressure and shifting responsibilities between payers and providers , '' Cognizant CEO Francisco D'Souza said in a statement .`` This creates a significant growth opportunity , which TriZetto will help us capture . ''The company in August forecast its slowest full-year sales growth in its 20-year history .Cognizant , whose rivals include Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and Infosys Ltd , said it expected revenue synergies of $ 1.5 billion over the next five years from the deal .The company said the deal would immediately add to adjusted profit on closing , expected in the quarter ending December .Apax Partners , which acquired TriZetto in 2008 , was exploring a sale of the company , sources told Reuters in August .TriZetto had 12-month earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortization of more than $ 190 million as of June 30 , one of the sources had then said .Cognizant said on Monday it would fund the deal through a combination of cash and debt and had secured $ 1 billion in financing .The deal comes after private equity firms Silver Lake Partners LP and BC Partners Ltd sold health insurance claims processor MultiPlan Inc for $ 4.4 billion in March to a consortium led by Maurice `` Hank '' Greenberg 's buyout firm Starr Investment Holdings LLC .Credit Suisse , UBS Securities LLC and Centerview Partners advised Cognizant , while J.P.Morgan Securities LLC and Goldman Sachs & Co advised TriZetto .Cognizant 's shares closed at $ 44.76 on the Nasdaq on Friday .( Reporting by Soham Chatterjee in Bangalore ; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty and Sriraj Kalluvila )
( Reuters ) - Consumers who purchased new health plans from Blue Shield of California have sued the insurer , claiming they were misled into thinking the insurance would cover their desired doctors and hospitals .In their complaint filed in California state court on Wednesday , San Francisco residents John Harrington and Alex Talon accused Blue Shield of misrepresenting that their plans , sold on California 's health exchange , would cover the full provider network advertised on the company 's website .They sued on behalf of a class of people who had purchased so-called `` preferred provider organization '' plans from the insurer only to realize that the doctor and hospital networks for their plans were limited .Blue Shield of California spokesman Sean Barry said in an emailed statement that the company was reviewing the complaint .`` We take these charges seriously , and believe enrollees should be as informed as possible about the products they select , '' he said .The 2010 Affordable Care Act , often called Obamacare , created online insurance exchanges where individuals can buy health coverage with income-based government subsidies . The law requires individuals to buy a minimum level of coverage or pay a penalty .As insurance companies have tried to make their plans offered on health exchanges more affordable , they have adopted a strategy of limiting their networks of medical providers . These networks have come under scrutiny as individuals have begun to realize their new plans may exclude their preferred doctor or hospital .Both Harrington and Talon , who were previously uninsured , purchased health plans from Blue Shield of California to comply with the new insurance requirement , known as the individual mandate , the complaint said .Harrington bought a so-called silver plan on California 's online exchange while Talon bought a platinum plan through the insurer 's website . They said they made their choices based on Blue Shield 's alleged representations that their doctors would be covered .The lawsuit accuses Blue Shield of advertising `` one of the largest networks in the state '' - with more than 60,000 physicians and 351 hospitals - and of failing to disclose that the networks for certain plans were substantially smaller .After receiving medical treatment numerous times between January and March , Harrington and Talon later discovered that their providers were not covered , forcing them to pay the charges out-of-pocket , the complaint said .The lawsuit alleged claims of false advertising , unfair business practices and breach of contract under California law .The case is Harrington et al v.

( Reuters ) - Democratic Governor Terry McAuliffe proposed a plan on Monday to provide medical insurance for 25,000 uninsured Virginians , a move that falls short of his vow to expand coverage to 400,000 people despite Republican objections .McAuliffe said in June after losing a fight with the Republican-controlled legislature over Medicaid , the federal-state healthcare program for the poor , that he would close the gap without lawmakers ' help .The 25,000 Virginians who would get insurance group about 20,000 people who are mentally ill and 5,000 children of state employees , the governor said in a statement .The insurance expansion is part of a 10-point healthcare program that would affect more than 200,000 people , mostly by improving care for those already in Medicaid and boosting efforts to sign up Virginians who qualify for it but are not enrolled .McAuliffe , who took office in January , said he would use $ 40 million in leftover state health care funds to provide coverage for the mentally ill .Virginia also can include children of state employees because the 2010 Affordable Care Act , known as Obamacare , lifted a ban against enrolling them in the federal program , he said .McAuliffe , a former head of the Democratic National Committee , campaigned in 2013 on increasing Medicaid coverage , a measure that he said would create 30,000 jobs in Virginia .McAuliffe had linked the state 's budget to Medicaid expansion . Republican state lawmakers inserted last-minute language into Virginia 's two-year budget in June to block McAuliffe 's proposed expansion to cover 400,000 uninsured Virginians .McAuliffe had contended that accepting $ 2 billion in federal funds to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act would create jobs , raise state salaries and bolster pensions .Republican lawmakers opted not to accept the funds .( Reporting by Ian Simpson ; Editing by Doina Chiacu )
( Reuters ) - Federal officials have reached an agreement with Pennsylvania Gov . Tom Corbett over his plan to use federal funds to pay for private health insurance coverage for up to 600,000 residents , the governor said on Thursday .The deal highlights a growing number of Republican governors who are finding ways to accept money under President Barack Obama 's Affordable Care Act , despite political opposition that has so far prevented nearly half of U.S. states from moving forward with the Medicaid expansion plan .Corbett sought a waiver in February to use those expansion funds to instead subsidize private health insurance for low-income residents .Medicaid expansion under Obamacare has become a tool for political jockeying , with many Republicans loathe to support it . In Pennsylvania , the dispute is partly semantic .Corbett , who is lagging in the polls in his bid for re-election this fall , said his plan , Healthy Pennsylvania , is not expansion under so-called Obamacare .The governor `` has been clear that he would not expand Medicaid because it is an unsustainable entitlement program , '' a statement from his office said on Thursday .However , federal officials said the approval made Pennsylvania the 27th state to expand Medicaid under Obamacare .Federal health officials are `` committed to supporting state flexibility and working with states on innovative solutions that work within the confines of the law to expand Medicaid to low-income individuals , '' said Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Administrator Marilyn Tavenner in a statement .Republican governors in Ohio , Michigan and Iowa have already extended health coverage to poor constituents with Medicaid funding under Obamacare . Indiana and Utah are actively negotiating for new plans with the administration .`` The politics in these states are tough . You ca n't simply do the Medicaid expansion as is and expect public support , '' said Benjamin Sommers , a Medicaid expert at the Harvard School of Public Health .Health reform advocates predicted that further expansions in Republican-led states will follow Pennsylvania 's lead by playing down the role of Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act in their programs .Federal officials did not approve a controversial Pennsylvania provision that would have required active job searches in order for the unemployed to receive coverage . But a voluntary job training program that reduces premium costs for participants was allowed .The approved program will also reduce 14 current Medicaid plans to two benefit packages , one for low-risk residents and another for high risk .Enrollment begins Dec. 1 , with coverage to go into effect Jan. 1 . Those earning 133 percent of the federal poverty level qualify , though the effective level is 138 percent , or $ 32,913 for a family of four .About 6.4 million Americans who live below the poverty line are expected to remain uninsured in the 23 states that have not expanded Medicaid .( Reporting by Hilary Russ in New York and David Morgan in Washington ; Editing by Diane Craft )
( Reuters ) - Health insurance premiums for low-cost Obamacare plans in 16 U.S. cities will fall slightly in 2015 as competition helps drives down price for the new subsidized individual health plans , according to a study Friday from the Kaiser Family Foundation .The Kaiser analysis found that the premiums for the second lowest cost `` silver '' tier plan , upon which government tax credit subsidies are based , will fall compared with 2014 prices by an average of 0.8 percent in 7 of 16 major cities .If the trend holds across the country , the study said , the lower benchmark premium could mean that the government subsidies are less overall and there are more tax savings .Private insurers began selling new health insurance plans for individuals last year for coverage starting in 2014 . Plans for 2015 insurance coverage will be up for sale starting on Nov. 15 , 2014 when enrollment opens .Kaiser found that among the biggest changes in pricing were a decline on average of more than 15 percent in Denver to $ 211 , of 11 percent in Providence , Rhode Island to $ 260 and of nearly 10 percent in Seattle to $ 254 .In Nashville , Tennessee , the silver premium price will rise 8.7 percent to $ 205 , while Burlington , Vermont will have a 6.6 percent rise to $ 440 and Portland , Oregon will go up 6 percent to $ 213 , the study said . The premiums exclude income-based government subsidies .Including these tax credits , the average in the 16 cities would be a monthly premium of $ 208 versus $ 209 a year earlier , the study found .Premiums for the lowest tier plan , bronze , are increasing an average of 3.3 percent in 2015 , the study found .Kaiser looked at plan premiums before and after federal tax credits for a 40-year old single adult who is a non-smoker and earns $ 30,000 per year .( Reporting by Caroline Humer ; Editing by Grant McCool )
( Reuters ) - Health insurer Humana Inc said on Thursday that it projected its enrollment mix in private plans through the exchanges created by President Barack Obama 's healthcare law will be , `` more adverse than previously expected . ''Humana attributed the enrollment trend to regulatory changes allowing people to remain in previously existing plans not sold on the exchanges . Obama proposed allowing insurers to keep selling plans that did not comply with the Affordable Care Act after political fallout that he was not keeping his promise that people can keep insurance plans if they like them .Humana released its projections in a U.S. securities filing ahead of meetings next week with investors and analysts . Despite the negative projections about the exchange enrollment , Humana backed its 2014 earnings forecast of $ 7.25 to $ 7.75 per share .The company , one of the largest providers of Medicare plans for the elderly , expected higher membership gains in its Medicare Advantage and Medicare prescription drug plans in 2014 , following the enrollment period for Medicare .( Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf .

( Reuters ) - Healthcare premiums will rise an average of 4.2 percent in 2015 on California 's health insurance exchange , the largest of the state marketplaces established by President Barack Obama 's healthcare reform , state officials said on Thursday .Ten companies will sell plans for 2015 through Covered California , three fewer than this year , said the exchange 's Executive Director Peter Lee .Opponents of Obama 's healthcare reform , the 2010 Affordable Care Act , have warned for months that 2015 premiums would soar due to the high medical costs of the first wave of enrollees who , they claimed , are older and sicker than the general population .In California , however , insurers ' projections of 2014 medical spending were fairly accurate . One of the largest insurers , WellPoint Inc , said this week that because its 2014 premiums matched medical costs it had generally proposed smaller increases than competitors .Other companies planning to sell 2015 Obamacare policies in California include Kaiser Permanente , Health Net , and Molina Healthcare .California is the largest of about a dozen states to announce proposed 2015 rates . Each state 's insurance department or other agency must approved premiums .Most increases are in the mid-single digits , Andy Slavitt , principal deputy commissioner of lead Obamacare agency the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , told Congress on Thursday .An analysis by the non-profit research and advocacy group FamiliesUSA found that proposed 2015 premiums varied widely from state to state and even within states . One Colorado plan has a 22 percent decrease while another has a 17.5 percent increase , for instance . In Indiana proposed rates vary from a 3 percent drop to a 35 percent rise .Overall , proposed premiums fell for at least one plan in nine of the 12 states , FamiliesUSA said .If the California premiums are approved , 16 percent of customers would see the same or lower premiums for their current plan , one-third would see an increase of up to 5 percent , one-third would pay 5 to 8 percent more , and 13 percent would pay 8 percent more . Consumers should shop around rather than automatically renew , said Lee of Covered California .One way insurers have kept a rein on spending was through `` narrow networks , '' covering healthcare received at a limited number of doctors and hospitals . That has triggered lawsuits against Anthem Blue Cross , a division of WellPoint and the largest Obamacare carrier in California , by customers claiming they were misled about where they could obtain care .Also , the state did not let people keep plans that did not comply with Obamacare standards . That brought an influx of healthy people that left California `` well positioned for modest premium increases , '' said healthcare policy expert Larry Levitt of the Kaiser Family Foundation .Insurers not returning in 2015 specialize in Medicaid plans and could not meet new requirements , Lee said .In the first open-enrollment period , 1.4 million people bought policies on Covered California , and 8 million nationally . The next enrollment period begins Nov. 15 .( Reporting by Sharon Begley and Caroline Humer in New York ; Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Cynthia Osterman )
( Reuters ) - Hospitals and medical practices across the United States braced for confusion and administrative hassles as new insurance plans under President Barack Obama 's healthcare law took effect on Wednesday .More than 2 million people enrolled in private plans offered under the Affordable Care Act , popularly known as Obamacare , during the initial sign-up period for health benefits . Enrollment began in October and lasts through March , but Americans in most states had to enroll by last week to get coverage that takes effect with the start of the new year .A spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , or CMS , part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services , said there were no hiccups to report in the first day the plans were in effect .The expansion of coverage through the new plans is one of the main parts of the 2010 law , the most sweeping U.S. social legislation in 50 years . Over time , the law - which requires most Americans to buy insurance , offers subsidies to help low-income people get covered and sets minimum standards for coverage - aims to dramatically reduce the number of Americans who lack health insurance , which the U.S. government has estimated at more than 45 million .After a difficult October launch plagued by problems with the website used to enroll people in coverage , the focus for the government and healthcare providers has turned to what will happen beginning on Wednesday when patients with the new coverage start to seek care .The law still faces political and legal hurdles . Roman Catholic Church-affiliated organizations obtained last-minute court injunctions on Tuesday that gave them temporary exemptions from a part of the healthcare law that requires employers to provide insurance policies covering contraception .U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor granted one temporary injunction to Baltimore-based Little Sisters of the Poor and Illinois-based Christian Brothers Services , plus related entities .The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services had 10,000 agents on call for New Year 's Eve and New Year 's Day to field questions from people dealing with enrollment problems .`` We are ready ourselves to assist consumers as well with our full complement of call center representatives available , '' said Julie Bataille , spokeswoman for the CMS .At the start , confirming a patient 's plan may present headaches for care providers . The Obama administration has acknowledged that errors occurred in transmitting enrollment data to insurers , especially early in the enrollment period . An official said it was `` reaching out '' to providers who have expressed concerns about implementation , and was also trying to help anticipate problems .`` It will be difficult for us to actually verify coverage - that 's my concern , '' said Dr. William Wulf , chief executive of Central Ohio Primary Care , which has 250 primary-care physicians .The task could be made more difficult by decisions by the U.S. government and many states to push back enrollment deadlines toward the end of the year . The late deadlines mean that many enrollees who seek care initially may lack insurance cards or other proof of coverage .Wulf said his physician offices will assume existing patients are covered if they say they are when they come in for appointments and their coverage can not be verified immediately . But if they require expensive tests , such as MRIs or heart-stress tests that can cost up to $ 700 , the practice will check with insurers first to make sure the patient has coverage .Dr. Andy Chiou , chief executive of Peoria Surgical Group Ltd in Illinois , said that if the practice finds a `` significant minority '' of its patients do not have coverage when they believe they do , it might delay elective surgeries for patients until their insurance is confirmed .`` For the protection of patients and us , we 'll have to say , 'Sorry , you do n't have insurance , ' '' Chiou said .POLITICAL STAKES HIGHFor the Obama administration , the political stakes are high in ensuring a smooth transition period for coverage , particularly after the website 's problems damaged the popularity of the Democratic president and the healthcare overhaul , his signature domestic achievement .The White House trumpeted New Year 's Day as the start of healthcare coverage for millions of Americans .`` The challenges in our healthcare system were decades in the making and wo n't be solved overnight , but now more than 6 million Americans have been enrolled in marketplace or Medicaid coverage and are getting peace of mind , '' wrote White House health policy adviser Phil Schiliro in a blog post .Republicans , who control the House of Representatives , have called Obamacare a costly program that will rob many Americans of insurance choices and have said they will make Obamacare 's problems their top issue in the November 2014 elections , when control of Congress will be at stake .Late Wednesday , though , Democrats in the House seized on the first day of the expansion as a political victory and pushed Republicans to give up on defanging the law .`` When Congress reconvenes next week , it is my hope that Republicans will work with Democrats to implement this law rather than continuing their focus on repealing its important patient protections and cost-saving reforms , '' said Steny Hoyer , who is the second most powerful Democrat in the House as Minority Whip , in a statement .Still , Republicans were bolstered by Sotomayor 's injunction , with Senator Roy Blunt , vice chairman of the Senate Republican Conference , saying the insurance mandate is `` an egregious and blatant violation '' of religious freedom .The U.S. government has tried to anticipate the coverage problems new enrollees might encounter . The federally run Healthcare.Gov website posted advice last week on what enrollees should do if they have not received an insurance card , encounter problems getting coverage for a drug prescription , or need to appeal a decision by an insurer .`` For consumers whose marketplace coverage begins on January 1 , we 're doing everything we can to help ensure a smooth transition period , '' Kathleen Sebelius , the U.S. secretary of health and human services , said in blog posting on Tuesday .`` What we are stressing to folks is that if they get to a provider ( and ) there is some confusion ( about coverage ) , call their insurer , '' Schiliro said . `` If the insurer is not able to resolve it , they should call our toll-free number ( 800-318-2596 ) ... and operators will be there 24/7 . ''Some healthcare companies are trying to get ahead of potential problems as well .The pharmacy chain Walgreen Co said on Monday it would allow consumers who had not yet received plan identification numbers from their insurers to get prescriptions at no upfront cost in January , if they could provide evidence of their coverage or pharmacy staff could otherwise confirm it .Wal-Mart said on Tuesday it would institute a similar practice .HOSPITALS READY FOR CHANGEHospital executives said they were ready for potential hiccups with the newly insured .The vast majority of Americans have employer-based coverage and Medicare plans and can choose new plans every January , so executives said the beginning of the Obamacare plans represented a more intense version of an insurance transition period they were already familiar with .`` Hospitals feel like they 're pretty well prepared because they 've had systems in place and tools in place to work through these sorts of issues , '' said Jeff Goldman , vice president of coverage policy for the American Hospital Association . `` We expect an uptick in volume , but we do n't think it 's anything beyond what most hospitals are prepared to handle . ''As many as 7 million people were expected to sign up for coverage in the Obamacare plans for 2014 , but enrollment is so far well short of that figure , largely because of the problems with the HealthCare.gov website . Residents of 36 states use the site to enroll . Those in the other 14 states use state-run websites . Hospitals , therefore , may have been preparing for more new enrollees than they are likely to see at this point .At New York 's Montefiore Medical Center , staffers were trained on how the new healthcare plans work , partly so they could help patients resolve any coverage issues , said Lynn Richmond , the medical center 's chief of staff .`` There 's not a lot of active worry on our part , '' Richmond said . `` We feel ready to manage the hiccups . ''Indeed , many have eagerly anticipated the law 's broadening of coverage . Across the country , hospital operators ' finances have been weighed down by patients who have been unable to pay their bills because they lacked sufficient insurance .`` We 're looking forward to the first quarter and beyond because we feel we 're in a very good position to benefit from the ACA , '' said Steven Campanini , a spokesman for Tenet Healthcare Corp , one of the largest publicly traded hospital chains .( Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf in New York and Julie Steenhuysen in Chicago ; Additional reporting by Susan Cornwell , Valerie Volcovici , Lisa Lambert and Lawrence Hurley in Washington ; Editing by David Lindsey , Jonathan Oatis , Peter Cooney and Chris Reese )
( Reuters ) - Humana Inc , which manages private Medicare and individual Obamacare insurance plans , said on Monday it has integrated its consumer health application with Apple Inc 's HealthKit .The move , the first announced by a major insurer , enables Humana customers to more easily manage fitness data and other personal health goals , the company said in a statement .Humana 's wellness program , called HumanaVitality , rewards members for hitting these goals , which include being more active , eating better or losing weight , with items such as movie tickets and fitness equipment .Apple 's HealthKit gathers data such as blood pressure and weight from various applications , enabling it to be viewed by consumers and doctors in one place . Its ease of use is expected to increase the data sharing between doctors and patients .Apple delayed the launch of HealthKit earlier this month when it pulled back its iOS 8 operating system for iPhones and iPads . HealthKit and the new Humana application , which has about 3.8 million eligible members , launched on Friday .( Reporting by Caroline Humer . Editing by Andre Grenon )
( Reuters ) - IT services provider Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp forecast current-quarter revenue above analysts ' estimates due to higher spending by financial services and healthcare clients .Shares of the company , which also reported higher-than-expected revenue for the third quarter , rose as much as 7.8 percent on Wednesday .Chief Financial Officer Karen McLoughlin told Reuters that spending by clients in pharmaceutical and life sciences industries was recovering after several quarters of slow growth .The company 's healthcare clients include insurers , hospitals and some state-run exchanges set up under the U.S . Affordable Care Act , also known as Obamacare .Growth in the business , which accounts for about 25 percent of total revenue , slowed significantly to 9.2 percent in the third quarter from 24 percent a year earlier and 19 percent in the second quarter .The year-earlier quarter reflected high demand for the company 's services from U.S. healthcare exchanges to handle initial enrollments for Obamacare .Cognizant said in September that it was acquiring healthcare IT services provider TriZetto Corp for $ 2.7 billion , its biggest deal ever , to boost its healthcare business .Cognizant forecast on Wednesday revenue of $ 2.61 billion- $ 2.64 billion for the fourth quarter .Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $ 2.58 billion , according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S .`` The overall demand environment remains strong , '' Cognizant President Gordon Coburn said on a conference call .The company 's net income rose to $ 355.6 million , or 58 cents per share , in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 from $ 319.6 million , or 53 cents per share , a year earlier , due to higher spending by North American and European clients .North America accounts for about three-quarters of the company 's total revenue , while Europe makes up for about 18 percent .Total revenue rose about 12 percent to $ 2.58 billion , above the average analyst estimate of $ 2.57 billion .Rival Tata Consultancy Services Ltd reported a lower-than expected quarterly profit last month , while Infosys Ltd 's quarterly profit beat the average analyst estimate .Cognizant 's shares were up 7.8 percent at $ 52.28 in afternoon trading on the Nasdaq .( Additional reporting by Lehar Maan in Bangalore ; Editing by Kirti Pandey )
( Reuters ) - In his essay coming out as gay , Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook criticized an Arizona proposal that would have given private business owners the ability to deny services to gay people on religious grounds .Cook on Thursday became the most prominent American corporate leader to come out , saying he was trading his closely guarded privacy for the chance to help move civil rights forward .His discussion of the Arizona proposal and other laws allowing gay employees to be fired highlights a new stage in the gay rights debate , after conservative challenges to same sex marriage were beaten down in several appeals courts .Now courts across the country are trying to balance the civil rights of gay people and some religious business owners . A Washington state florist , bakers in Colorado and Oregon , and a bed-and-breakfast owner in Hawaii all are refusing to provide services to gay couples , citing religious beliefs .In Massachusetts , a gay food service manager sued a religious school after it pulled a job offer upon learning of his husband .The U.S. Supreme Court has issued a string of rulings friendly to gay marriage over the past two years . Most recently , the high court effectively legalized same sex nuptials in several states when it refused to overturn lower court rulings .However , the high court has also been assertive in protecting religious freedom . In an opinion earlier this year , the court allowed a business owner to avoid an Obamacare requirement for employee birth control , citing the owner 's religious beliefs .That case , Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores , has now surfaced in a dispute between two gay California women and a Hawaii bed and breakfast owner who refused to rent a room to them . A Hawaii judge ruled the business owner violated an antidiscrimination law , and she appealed .`` Because of her sincerely held religious beliefs , she does not allow unmarried opposite-sex couples or same-sex couples to rent a room with a single bed together , '' her lawyers said in a court filing . They later cited the Hobby Lobby decision , saying it limits the government 's ability to compel religious objectors to change their business practices .Lawyers for the business owner did not immediately respond to a call for comment .The California couple 's lawyers argued Hobby Lobby provides no shield for discrimination even if cloaked as religious practice . The case is still pending at a Hawaii appeals court .Jennifer Pizer , Law and Policy Project Director for gay rights group Lambda Legal , said the Supreme Court could be even more deferential to religious groups in future cases .`` That affects the overall landscape in a very profound way , and often not in a good way for gay people , '' she said .The Arizona proposal was passed by the state legislature and vetoed by the governor earlier this year . Other states considering religious exemption bills include Georgia , Kansas , Michigan , Missouri , South Dakota and Tennessee , Pizer said .( Reporting by Dan Levine in San Francisco and Fiona Ortiz in Chicago , editing by Peter Henderson )
( Reuters ) - Individuals who purchased health insurance set up under U.S. President Barack Obama 's healthcare reform law rate their personal health as worse than people who bought individual plans elsewhere , a Kaiser Family Foundation survey found .The survey , conducted after enrollment in Obamacare plans closed in April and released on Thursday , is the first comprehensive study addressing the health of those who have purchased this new insurance , created by the Affordable Care Act .About 8 million people purchased Obamacare plans , more than half of them qualifying for government subsidies toward their monthly premiums based on household income .The relative health of policyholders is a key factor for insurers when they set premium rates , which are designed to cover the costs of medical services among participants . Kaiser said it was unclear how this finding might influence rates because insurers had been anticipating a sicker-than-average customer base .The telephone survey of a nationally representative sample of 742 people also found that 57 percent of the new Obamacare plan members had been uninsured just before they obtained coverage . Most of them said they had not had coverage for at least two years .Insurers including WellPoint Inc and Aetna Inc have said they are still gathering data about their new customers , many of whose coverage did not start until May 1 . Insurers have already submitted many of their 2015 rates to regulators .The survey found that 16 percent of respondents with Obamacare plans purchased on state exchanges rated their health as `` fair , '' the fourth-worst of five levels offered . That compared with an average of 11 percent for all people who bought individual insurance .About 4 percent of people buying from the Obamacare exchanges rated their health as `` poor , '' compared with 2 percent in individual plans sold outside of those exchange and less than 0.5 percent of people who still hold plans that do not comply with the law . These plans are expected to phase out of the market in the next three years .At the opposite end , 21 percent of people in Obamacare exchange plans said they had `` excellent '' health , compared with 24 percent of all individual plan holders .Twenty-seven percent of Obamacare plan members said they had `` very good '' health , compared with 31 percent overall , and 31 percent said they had `` good '' health , compared with 30 percent overall .Kaiser found the 55-to-64 age group was the largest among members of ACA-compliant plans sold both on and off the exchanges . People older than 65 are eligible for the government 's Medicare program .Of the other holders of ACA-compliant plans , 17 percent were aged 18 to 25 , and another 17 percent were 26 to 34 . About 19 percent were 35 to 44 , and 21 percent were in the 45-to-54 age bracket .The survey was conducted April 3 to May 11 .
( Reuters ) - One of the most highly contentious Obamacare programs , which calls on states to expand their publicly-funded healthcare for the poor , could see a second wave of participation by U.S. states later this year or early in 2015 , according to state officials and independent analysts .Following are states whose governor 's offices or legislators have held talks with President Barack Obama 's administration about possible options for extending healthcare coverage known as Medicaid to uninsured low-income residents .Also included are the financial costs and benefits they could see over the coming decade by opting for expansion .The Obama administration says it will cover 100 percent of the cost of expansion through 2016 , and never less than 90 percent thereafter , a prospect that would mean billions of dollars in new federal funding for even sparsely populated states . But Republicans worry that the federal government 's commitment could weaken over time , leaving states to foot some substantial Medicaid bills .The Medicaid expansion is part of a broader reform under the law called Affordable Care Act , or Obamacare , which aims to reduce healthcare costs , now the highest in the world , make health insurance more affordable and limit the number of uninsured Americans .Medicaid was created in the 1960s along with the federal program Medicare , which provides health coverage for the elderly . Most Medicaid coverage , jointly financed by federal and state money , has gone to narrowly defined groups including children , pregnant women and the severely disabled – a fact that has left millions of poor adults without healthcare until now .The following data comes from a report by the nonpartisan Urban Institute . Estimates are in the billions of dollars .State State Costs New Federal FundingIndiana $ 1.099 $ 17.3Missouri 1.573 17.8Montana 0.194 2.1North Carolina 3.075 39.6South Dakota 0.157 2.1Tennessee 1.715 22.5Utah 0.364 5.3Wyoming 0.118 1.4Three other states , which have rejected the Medicaid expansion up to now , could be in a position to reverse course if their Republican governors lose reelection to Democratic challengers in the November election , analysts say .They are:States State Costs New Federal FundingFlorida $ 5.364 $ 66.1Maine -0.570* 3.1Wisconsin -0.248* 12.3*Some states are shown with state Medicaid savings , indicated by a negative entry , based on expectations that adults will continue to receive Medicaid benefits under pre-Obamacare programs .( Reporting by David Morgan ; Editing by Tomasz Janowski )
( Reuters ) - Republicans in Congress sought to showcase what they call major security problems with the Obamacare website HealthCare.gov on Thursday , just as U.S. officials ramp up a national campaign to persuade young adults to use the site to enroll in health insurance .In a public messaging tug-of-war that will likely intensify in coming weeks , the Republican-led House of Representatives targeted the healthcare reform law in three separate oversight hearings . Two were geared toward Republican claims that HealthCare.gov remains vulnerable to hackers more than three months after its botched October 1 rollout .Democrats accused Republicans of `` cherry picking '' partial information about the website to try and scare consumers away from it . Later in the day , Obamacare supporters , including federal and state officials , staged a six-hour presentation on YouTube.com intended to drive enrollment among 18-to-34-year-olds .The administration also disclosed plans for a media promotion campaign during next month 's Winter Olympics in Sochi , Russia , and unveiled 30-second ads with former basketball stars Magic Johnson and Alonzo Mourning .U.S. officials are eager to boost youth participation , which is widely seen as vital to the success of President Barack Obama 's signature domestic policy achievement .The administration needs enough young people , who are typically healthier , so that their premiums will help offset costs from older enrollees and prevent insurers from raising their rates .Officials hope to enroll more than 2.5 million young Americans in coverage by a March 31 deadline . So far they have signed up only about one-fifth of that number , partly due to early technical glitches at HealthCare.gov .While the performance of the website has greatly improved , the Obama administration is contending with fresh attacks from Republicans eager to highlight the healthcare reform 's flaws , including security questions .`` It seems to defy common sense that a website plagued with functional problems was , in fact , perfectly secure by design , '' said Darrell Issa , chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , who presided over one of Thursday 's security hearings .At another Republican-led hearing , a cybersecurity professional warned that the federal government has failed to implement fixes necessary to protect the HealthCare.gov website from hackers .`` HealthCare.gov is not secure today , '' David Kennedy , head of computer security consulting firm TrustedSec LLC , told the House Science , Space and Technology Committee .HealthCare.gov is the consumer web portal to a 36-state federal health insurance marketplace , which offers private insurance , with federally subsidized rates for some consumers . The 14 other states have built their own marketplaces .Kennedy said `` nothing has really changed '' since a hearing before the same committee in November when he and three other expert witnesses said they believed the site was not secure and three of them said it should be shut down immediately .`` I do n't understand how we 're still discussing whether the website is insecure or not , '' said Kennedy , who worked for the National Security Agency and the U.S. Marine Corps before entering the private sector . `` It is insecure - 100 percent . ''Before the hearing , Kennedy told Reuters the government has yet to plug more than 20 vulnerabilities that he and other security experts reported to the government shortly after HealthCare.gov went live on October 1 . Hackers could steal personal information , modify data , attack the personal computers of website users and damage the infrastructure of the site , Kennedy said in an interview .The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) , the federal agency responsible for HealthCare.gov , said in a statement to Reuters , `` There have been no successful security attacks on Healthcare.gov and no person or group has maliciously accessed personally identifiable information from the site . ''CMS said Kennedy 's methodology undermined his findings : `` Because this individual had no direct access to the operations of the HealthCare.gov website , the information in the report is based on assumptions , not fact . ''The agency 's information security chief also publicly tried to reassure lawmakers that the site is safe .The CMS chief information security officer , Teresa Fryer , said the website underwent end-to-end security testing on December 18 and met all industry standards .`` The ( federal marketplace ) is secure . In many instances , we have gone above and beyond what is required , with layered protection , continuous monitoring and additional penetration testing , '' Fryer said before the House Oversight panel .Democratic Representative Elijah Cummings charged that Republicans were `` cherry-picking partial information to promote a narrative that is inaccurate '' about the Obamacare website , when its security was `` strong and keeps getting stronger '' .Instead of holding ever more hearings on the Obamacare website , lawmakers should be looking into the massive data breach affecting millions at Target Corp , Cummings said at the hearing where CMS 's Fryer appeared .As the hearings took place , Republicans sought to amplify their anti-Obamacare message by advancing another bill to tweak the law . The legislation , which passed by a 259-154 vote , would require the Obama administration to issue weekly enrollment statistics .The White House considers the transparency bill another Republican attempt to harass implementation of its healthcare reform . However , 33 Democrats voted for the bill . Last week , the House passed a Republican measure that would require the government to notify consumers in two days if their personal information on HealthCare.gov has been compromised .( Additional reporting by Susan Cornwell , Doina Chiacu and Bill Trott in Washington ; Editing by Karey Van Hall and Leslie Adler )
( Reuters ) - The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) , in an effort to keep insurers from denying coverage to people with HIV/AIDS , may strengthen its position on health plans accepting third-party payments , such as those under the 1990 Ryan White Act .Hundreds of people with HIV/AIDS in Louisiana trying to obtain coverage under President Barack Obama 's healthcare reform are in danger of being thrown out of the insurance plan they selected in a dispute over federal subsidies and interpretation of rules about preventing Obamacare fraud , Reuters reported on Saturday .Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana , the state 's largest health insurer , is rejecting checks from a federal program designed to help these patients pay for AIDS drugs and insurance premiums , and has begun notifying customers that their enrollment in its Obamacare plans will be discontinued .The insurer insists it is not trying to keep people with HIV/AIDS from enrolling in one of its policies under the Affordable Care Act , but is instead rejecting third party premium payments in an effort to prevent potential fraud .`` Federal rules do not prevent the use of Ryan White funds to pay for health care plans , '' CMS said in a statement late on Saturday , adding that it had issued guidance `` encouraging issuers and Marketplaces to accept such payments . ''CMS suggested that such encouragement may not be enough to protect patients in need of expensive life-saving medicines .`` Given the importance of access to care for people with HIV/AIDS , CMS is considering amending those rules to require issuers to accept these payments , '' the lead Obamacare agency said .The 1990 Ryan White Act offered people with HIV/AIDS federal financial help in paying for AIDS drugs and health insurance premiums , especially in state-run , high-risk pools . Obamacare , which bans insurers from discriminating against people with preexisting conditions , was designed to replace these high-risk pools .Hundreds of HIV/AIDS patients are dependent on Ryan White payments for Obamacare because they fall into a coverage gap . They are not eligible for Medicaid , the joint federal-state health insurance program for the poor , because Louisiana did not expand the low-income program , and Obamacare federal subsidies do n't kick in until people are at 100 percent of the federal poverty level .( Reporting by Bill Berkrot and Sharon Begley ; Editing by Bernard Orr )
( Reuters ) - The U.S. Supreme Court has been asked to review a case about whether the federal government can subsidize health insurance for millions of Americans , a party involved in the lawsuit said on Thursday .The petition requests the U.S. high court decide the issue after two lower U.S. court rulings created uncertainties last week regarding the legitimacy of subsidies for individuals enrolled on federally run exchanges under the Affordable Care Act , or Obamacare .The Competitive Enterprise Institute , which is coordinating and funding the cases , filed the petition , according to the not-for-profit 's website . ( http : //bit.ly/1tA8r5x )The twin appeals court rulings , handed down by three-judge panels in Washington , D.C. , and Richmond , Virginia , fell in line with partisan disagreements over healthcare reform . Two judges appointed by Republican presidents decided against the administration in the District of Columbia and three judges appointed by Democrats ruled in favor in Virginia .The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled in a 2-1 decision that the language in the Affordable Care Act dealing with subsidies shows they should only be provided to consumers who purchase benefits on exchanges run by individual states .However , plaintiffs in the D.C . Circuit case , known as Halbig v. Burwell , claimed that Congress did not intend to provide subsidies through federally operated marketplaces .While the Supreme Court has broad discretion over which cases to take , a split among lower courts can be a big factor in its deciding whether to hear an appeal .The Supreme Court upheld the Obamacare law on constitutional grounds in 2012 but allowed states to opt out of a major provision involving Medicaid coverage .Analysts estimate that as many as 5 million people could be affected if subsidies disappear from the federal marketplace , which serves 36 states through the website HealthCare.gov .( Reporting by Narottam Medhora and Amrutha Penumudi in Bangalore ; Editing by Lisa Shumaker )
( Reuters ) - The number of insurers offering individual health plans on the Obamacare exchanges will increase about 25 percent in 2015 and that should keep down prices , the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said on Tuesday in a report .More than 7 million people signed up for health insurance through the exchanges in 2014 , which were created under President Barack Obama 's national healthcare reform law and offer income-based subsidies .Next year , there will be 63 additional issuers in the 44 states for which it has data , the agency said in a report . Some insurers left the market , it said .Healthcare.gov , which sells insurance in 36 states , will have 248 issuers in 2015 , an increase of 30 percent from 2014 , it said .`` We 're seeing it as evidence that these are attractive marketplaces , and just from our casual review of investor communications by the firms , these are being seen as growth opportunities , '' an HHS official said .The nation 's largest health insurer UnitedHealth Group Inc , which offered only a few plans in 2014 , submitted plans in more than two dozen states . Other large insurers have said they have either maintained or increased their presence on the exchanges for 2015 . Aetna Inc , Humana Incand WellPoint Inc all offer more than a dozen plans .Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell cited the increase in the number of insurers selling plans and a study showing that 7 in 10 Americans find the coverage affordable . `` There 's no surprise ... that when folks evaluate the success of the law , the marketplace receives much of the attention , '' she said in prepared remarks for a speech at Brookings .The report said past data has shown that for each additional insurer , the monthly premium price in that market declines for the benchmark plan by 4 percent .Based on the data collected for the 44 states , only California is expected to have a decline in the number of insurers offering plans to 10 from 12 . New Hampshire and West Virginia , which both had only 1 insurer offering plans in 2014 , will increase to 5 insurers and 2 insurers respectively . Each insurer is counted as one issuer in each state where it sells plans .There are six states running their own online marketplaces whose information was not included in the report . They include Hawaii , Kentucky Minnesota , Massachusetts , Nevada , Oregon , and Vermont .( Reporting by Caroline Humer and David Morgan in Washington D.C. ; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli and Andrew Hay )
( Reuters ) - U.S. consumers eligible for Obamacare health plans could see double-digit price hikes next year in states that fail to draw large numbers of enrollees for 2014 , including some states that have been hostile to the healthcare law , according to insurance industry officials and analysts .The early estimates come as insurance companies set out to design plans they intend to sell in 2015 through the state-based health insurance marketplaces that are a centerpiece of the Affordable Care Act , President Barack Obama 's signature domestic policy achievement that is widely referred to as Obamacare .WellPoint Inc , which sells plans on 14 Obamacare exchanges , expects health insurance rates nationwide to be higher . Increases for the Obamacare market that has signed up about 5 million people to date is expected to outpace those in the employer-sponsored market , which serves about 170 million people .`` Looking at the rate increases on a year-over-year basis on our exchanges , and it will vary by carrier , but all of them will probably be in double digit plus , '' Ken Goulet , president of WellPoint 's commercial business , told investors in New York on Friday .The cost of health insurance is already a political hot potato in this year 's election campaign for control of Congress , with Republicans warning of the potential for sky-rocketing rates in their attempt to turn the ballot into a referendum on Obamacare .Insurers have noted the difficulty of building and pricing plans for 2015 , which will mark the second year of the Obamacare exchanges . Enrollment for 2014 closes on March 31 , giving them very little time to review the costs of covering their new members before submitting proposed rates to insurance regulators in May and June .Industry officials and independent analysts say the lack of hard data will mean huge variations in premiums , with increases ranging from the high single-digit percentages in some states to as much as 30 percent in others .Slow enrollment is a potential harbinger of big price hikes in over a dozen states , where technology failures or political opposition to Obamacare may have deterred younger and healthier residents from signing up .Because the healthcare law prevents insurers from charging sick people higher premiums , the participation of healthy young people is needed to offset the cost of covering policyholders with preexisting conditions . Government data so far has shown about 25 percent of new Obamacare enrollees are in the younger demographic of adults aged 18 to 34 , well below the White House 's 38 percent target before last October 's botched rollout .Government actuaries predict an 8 percent increase in overall net insurance costs next year . Last week , U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told a congressional committee : `` I think premiums are likely to go up , but go up at a slower pace than what we 've seen since 2010 . ''Some analysts say the more dire industry expectations reflect companies ' uncertainty rather than the true costs of the market .`` I think it 'll be the exception . But there will be some sections of the country with significantly higher insurance premiums , '' said Larry Levitt , a policy expert at the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation , which tracks healthcare trends .Levitt predicts that most states will see premium increases of 7 percent to 10 percent in 2015 , as insurers compensate for factors including the rising cost of medical services and reduced funding for a temporary federal program that compensates insurers for high claim costs .COMPETITIVE PRESSURELevitt and other analysts said competition between plans should also brake upward price momentum in most states , while some consumers should also benefit from aggressive state insurance regulators unwilling to allow big cost hikes .Even after the end of open enrollment , a steady stream of new customers is expected to transition into the Obamacare marketplaces throughout 2014 , due to life changes that allow for special enrollments , including job loss , marriage and parenthood . As a result , insurers could find themselves under constant pressure to keep prices competitive .`` There 's going to be this continuing need to market and get new enrollees , '' said Sarah Thomas , research director at the Deloitte Center for Health Solutions .`` I would n't be surprised to see higher rates in markets where there 's not as much competition . But I also would n't be surprised if it 's not as bad as some of the CEOs are making out , '' she said .The highest rate increases are expected among states whose marketplaces have little competition between insurers , low enrollment and hands-off regulators who do little to influence insurer decisions .Another contributing factor could be a decision by states to allow insurers to keep older health plans on the market that do not comply with Obamacare , an option offered by the President following a public outcry over policy cancellations .`` In California , where enrollment has been so strong , it 'll probably be easier for actuaries to feel confident about their pricing , versus states where enrollment is very anemic , '' said Dan Mendelson , chief executive at the consulting firm Avalere Health .One metric of enrollment success - and a potential indicator of future rate increases - is market penetration . In 16 states , sign-ups represent less than 10 percent of the potential marketplace population , according to a Kaiser Family Foundation study of enrollment data released by the administration on March 1 . Analysts say those markets could skew toward older , sicker members , which raises the likelihood of rate increases .The list includes Republican-led states that have rejected Obamacare : Louisiana , Texas , Kansas and Oklahoma . But also on the list are Democratic states with marketplaces that have been stalled by technology problems : Massachusetts , Hawaii and Maryland .At the top of the enrollment success scale , Kaiser found that Vermont has enrolled 54 percent of its potential market , while California , Idaho , Maine , Michigan , New York , Rhode Island and Washington have each enrolled about 20 percent or more .( Reporting by David Morgan in Washington and Caroline Humer in New York ; Editing by Michele Gershberg , Bernard Orr )
( Reuters ) - U.S. insurers planning to sell 2015 Obamacare health plans expect at least 20 percent growth in customers and in some states anticipate more than doubling sign-ups .In interviews with Reuters , half a dozen privately held and non-profit health insurers around the country say they are expecting this growth based on interest from potential customers they are hearing about through their call centers , sales forces and brokers .With the start of enrollment barely two weeks away , their assessment is dramatically different from a year ago , when it was unclear how many Americans would apply for the brand new insurance and income-based subsidies offered under President Barack Obama’s healthcare law .Despite crippling technology issues with the HealthCare.gov website , more than 7 million people signed up for Obamacare plans in 2014 .In Florida , Jason Alford , sales director at Health First Health Plans Inc , expects to more than double customers in Affordable Care Act compliant plans from the 4,400 it signed up this year .`` We 've just talked to so many people in the market who for one of 5 or 6 different reasons did n't enroll in 2014 . We had many folks call this summer who really do n't understand the open enrollment period . They are calling in August to sign up for a plan because they think it 's all-year enrollment , '' he explained .When the three-month enrollment period opens on Nov. 15 , it will be a critical juncture for insurers who need to build profitable businesses that can stand up as government financial supports to insurers who sell these plans decline in the next two years .Aimed at extending health insurance to 25 million people , the law has been controversial for its cost to taxpayers and the changes it has spurred in coverage . Millions of individual plans were canceled for 2014 and some employers stopped insuring part-time workers .Support for the law tends to fall along political lines and has waned overall , polls say . Public support fell to 40 percent in 2014 , from 44 percent in 2012 and 42 percent in 2010 , Harvard researchers said this week .The exchanges have become a big business for insurers like Aetna Inc and WellPoint Inc , who enrolled hundreds of thousands of new customers last year . UnitedHealth Group Inc , barely on the exchanges in 2014 , will be in two dozen states . These insurers have not discussed 2015 forecasts .There is political importance for Obama as well . The Congressional Budget Office expects 13 million people to buy exchange plans in 2015 and 24 million in 2016 . If those numbers materialize , it will make it even more difficult for Republicans and other foes to uproot the embattled law .Insurers would not say whether they agreed with CBO forecasts , but many interviewed by Reuters have doubled or tripled staffing to handle applicants . Some saw customer calls up 30 percent in October . Only those with qualifying events such as job loss can buy insurance outside the regular enrollment period .In Pennsylvania , where Medicaid is being expanded , Independence Blue Cross hopes to add about 30,000 new customers to the 165,000 it signed up for 2014 plans .`` We 're thinking pretty positive . Last week we saw our call center activity increase 31 percent from a call volume standpoint versus the previous few weeks , '' Brian Lobley , a senior vice president at Independence Blue Cross in Pennsylvania , said in an interview .Lobley is seeing growth at a slower pace than CBO suggests because some customers may qualify for benefits under Medicaid when the state makes it available for more residents .In Texas , one small insurer predicts growth of 15,000 to 40,000 more customers from the fewer than 500 it signed up last year .Non-profit insurer Community Health Choice Inc in Houston priced premium rates too high and was mostly shut out in 2014 , said Daisy Morales , vice president of marketing . This year , with more competitive premiums , it expects to win new customers by gaining market share and because of forecasts for growth in the state . The insurer foresees one million new sign-ups in Texas in addition to the more than 700,000 who enrolled in 2014 .`` It 's not like we 're starting from scratch , like we were last year , '' Morales said .( Reporting by Caroline Humer ; additional reporting by David Morgan in Washington ; editing by Gunna Dickson )
( Reuters ) - Virginia 's Republican-controlled legislature passed a two-year budget late on Thursday that shot down the Democratic governor 's proposal to expand Medicaid and closed a $ 1.55 billion revenue shortfall .Expanding Medicaid , the health insurance program for low-income people , to about 400,000 Virginians under the federal Affordable Care Act had been Governor Terry McAuliffe 's chief legislative priority . He has not said whether he will approve the lawmakers ' spending plan .McAuliffe , in a stand-off for months with Republicans , had linked the budget to Medicaid expansion . The impasse was broken this week when a Democratic state senator said he resigned to secure his daughter a judgeship , giving the Republicans control of the upper chamber .The Senate passed the spending plan 21-18 , and the House of Delegates voted for it 69-31 . A July 1 government shutdown looms if a budget is not approved .`` When this budget reaches my desk I will evaluate it carefully and take the actions that I deem necessary , '' McAuliffe said in a statement on Friday . `` But this fight is far from over . ''The Affordable Care Act , launched in October and also known as Obamacare , is designed to extend health coverage to uninsured Americans through subsidized private health insurance and by expanding Medicaid coverage . Medicaid is run by states but overseen by the federal government .The U.S. Supreme Court has allowed states to opt out of Medicaid expansion . Obamacare is unpopular among Republicans and has become a campaign issue ahead of the November midterm congressional elections .The budget bill would slash spending by nearly $ 900 million and tap a state reserve fund to cover the shortfall .( Reporting by John Clarke ; Editing by Ian Simpson and Dan Grebler )
( Reuters ) - When Washington eliminated corporate tax deductions on health insurance executive compensation above $ 500,000 under President Barack Obama 's healthcare reform law in 2013 , it generated more than $ 72 million in additional tax revenue for the U.S. government , a left-leaning think tank said on Wednesday .The report from the Institute for Policy Studies examined executive compensation in the 2013 proxy filings from WellPoint Inc and UnitedHealth Group Inc , among others , and found that those companies paid more taxes than they would have if the law had not been passed .The study , written by a team that focuses on executive compensation issues , provides a look into how much revenue the government could raise if it eliminated this deduction more broadly .After examining the 10 largest publicly traded health insurers , it found that corporate taxes on their pay would likely increase in coming years because some 2013 compensation included stock options that predated the law .Based on those disclosures , it calculated the corporate tax each company paid on the compensation of the top five executives versus what the companies would have paid based on the U.S. tax code that applied to insurers prior to 2013 and that continues to be used by most other U.S. corporations outside of the health insurance industry .The report said that if all corporations were to be taxed this way , it would raise $ 50 billion more in revenue for the U.S. government .`` I do see real momentum in applying this across the board , '' Sarah Anderson , Global Economy Project Director at the institute and a report author , said . `` The report shows that the sky is not falling on these companies . ''Health insurers have been at the center of the national healthcare reform law , which has set new benefit standards for coverage , changed government payments for private Medicare benefits , expanded Medicaid to more income levels and created a new type of health insurance for individuals .The law also instituted limits on insurer profit and created new premium rate review procedures and taxes for insurers and corporations .Brendan Buck , a spokesman for the insurance industry 's largest lobbying group , America 's Health Insurance Plans , said , `` Requiring plans to pay higher taxes does nothing to make coverage more affordable or accessible . ''The nation 's biggest health insurer , UnitedHealth , had the largest change in corporate tax payments under the new rules , according to the report . It paid $ 19 million more in corporate taxes , based on a rate of 35 percent .WellPoint lowered its 2013 corporate tax bill by more than $ 1.5 million by accelerating the vesting of executive stock awards into late 2012 just before the reform took place , the report said . The company , which reported compensation on six executives in its proxy , paid about $ 10 million more in corporate taxes in 2013 than it would have under the old rules .WellPoint declined to comment . UnitedHealth was not immediately available .( Reporting by Caroline Humer in New York ; editing by Matthew Lewis )

12:31 p.m. | Updated Mitt Romney declared Thursday that he would “act to repeal Obamacare” if he was elected president , saying that he agreed with the dissenting justices in the Supreme Court ruling on Thursday .With the Capitol over his shoulder and standing in front of a podium with a sign that read “Repeal and Replace Obamacare , ” Mr. Romney said the health of the American economy depended on getting rid of the health care law .“Our mission is clear : if we want to get rid of Obamacare , we are going to have to replace President Obama , ” Mr. Romney said . “That is my mission . That is our work . And I’m asking the American people to join me.”Mr. Romney said the court’s ruling underscored the choice before American voters , one that he said was between bigger government that could take away health insurance choices or a Republican plan to preserve them .“We have to make sure that people who want to keep their current insurance will be able to do so , ” Mr. Romney said in the brief statement . “This is now the time for the American people to make a choice.”Mr. Romney might have been hoping for a different court decision , but his campaign staff was not complaining .“No question that politically it is a huge energizer , ” said a top campaign aide , speaking on the condition of anonymity to speak more freely about the campaign’s thinking . “Politically it is a big positive for Romney campaign.”Mr. Romney’s promise to repeal the president’s health care plan in his standard stump speech always gets applause , and now Mr. Romney can tie repeal to the November election . “If we want to get rid of Obamacare , we’re going to have to replace President Obama , ” Mr. Romney said Thursday afternoon , offering a line that his aides are already echoing .Mr. Romney can be nuanced , which has tripped him up at times . But his campaign prefers one or two simple arguments ( see : jobs and the economy ) , and they seem to have found another one in the ruling on Thursday : Repeal Obamacare/replace President Obama ) .Romney aides expect that the court’s decision will revitalize their base , creating an intensity and energy similar to the 2010 midterm elections , when many Republicans ran against the president’s health care plan and the party retook the House .From the time the ruling was announced until Thursday afternoon , the campaign had raised more that $ 375,000 in donations .Mr. Romney learned of the decision in his hotel room at the Washington Hilton , where he watched coverage of the ruling on television . Some of his top aides — including Russ Schrieffer , a chief strategist ; Neil Newhouse , the campaign’s pollster ; Lanhee Chen , the policy director ; and Katie Packer Gage , the deputy campaign manager — were also on hand in Washington .The campaign had kept the details of Mr. Romney’s announcement a secret until the last minute and had reporters gather at the Hilton for a bus ride to a location that remained “T.B.D.” until less than an hour before Mr. Romney made his remarks . Television correspondents broadcasting from in front of the podium where Mr. Romney was set to speak were not allowed to disclose the location .Though Mr. Romney had prepared several possible responses to the likely outcomes , which he previewed at campaign events in Virginia this week , many in the campaign were privately surprised that the court had not overturned the mandate portion of the president’s health care plan .Mr. Romney spoke shortly before noon on the rooftop of 101 Constitution , an office building in the shadow of the Capitol that also houses a Charlie Palmer steakhouse . The mood was subdued as the news media waited for Mr. Romney to arrive , and the candidate himself was equally sedate .He spoke for just over four minutes .
12:46 p.m. | Updated Gov . Rick Perry of Texas , still reeling from a debate performance that upset many of the bedrock conservatives he considers his base , came out swinging Friday against his rival Mitt Romney , accusing the former Massachusetts governor of backing policies indistinguishable from those of President Obama and having “paved the way for Obamacare.”While Mr. Perry has already been sharply critical of Mr. Romney and his health care record , the Texan’s speech before the Georgia Public Policy Foundation was a more intensive critique and seemed to reflect a strategy to undercut Mr. Romney’s attempts to draw away Perry supporters and other Republican voters .Now , he seems to be angling to convince G.O.P . primary voters that they can not trust Mr. Romney on almost anything . While his speech was billed as a domestic policy address , he offered little in the way of policy proposals and instead focused on attacking the Obama administration and Mr. Romney .“What we are seeing in America today is a conservative awakening , a revival born out of a deep concern that liberals have used the machinery of the federal government to impose a nanny state that limits our freedom and that targets free enterprise , ” Mr. Perry said , according to The Associated Press .“I knew when I got into this race I would have my hands full fighting President Obama’s big government agenda , ” he adds . “I just didn’t think it would be in the Republican primary.”Ryan Williams , a spokesman for Mr. Romney , accused Mr. Perry of misleading voters .“Governor Perry is desperate to shift attention away from his liberal policies that encourage illegal immigration , ” Mr. Williams said . “His repeated use of distortions and fabrications on the campaign trail shows that Rick Perry can’t be trusted to tell the truth.”Mr. Perry’s remarks come as he is also trying to win back conservative Republican primary voters who may be giving him second thoughts because of his record on issues like and vaccinating teenage girls against the human papillomavirus , or HPV .On Wednesday , Mr. Perry backpedaled from a statement in the most recent Republican debate that those who disagree with his immigration stance were heartless . He now describes the comment as “inappropriate.”Ashley Parker contributed reporting to this post .
2:41 p.m. | Updated Rick Santorum used the backdrop of the Supreme Court’s hearings on the health care law Monday to slam Mitt Romney as a compromised candidate who all but inspired President Obama to overhaul the nation’s health care system .Standing in front of the court after the first of three days of arguments about the constitutionality of the law Republicans call “Obamacare , ” Mr. Santorum mocked Mr. Romney for campaigning across the continent , in San Diego , instead of showing up at the court to protest .“There’s one candidate who is uniquely disqualified to make the case” against Mr. Obama’s health care law , Mr. Santorum declared as supporters of the law chanted “Health care is a right ! ” in the background . “It’s why I’m here and he’s not.”The accusation was a reprise of comments over the weekend in which Mr. Santorum angrily said Mr. Romney is “the worst Republican in the country” to go up against Mr. Obama on the need to repeal the health care law .Trailing badly in the chase for delegates as he battles Mr. Romney , Mr. Santorum is trying to tap into the intense anger among conservatives about the health care law . He is trying to make the case that there is little philosophical difference between Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney .But that task has proved tricky for Mr. Santorum , who seemed to suggest last week that if Mr. Romney were the nominee , voters would be better off sticking with Mr. Obama in the White House . Mr. Santorum later said his words were taken out of context and denied that he would ever support Mr. Obama over a Republican .On Monday , Mr. Santorum said he did not regret calling Mr. Romney “the worst Republican” on the health care issue , saying that Mr. Romney’s support in Massachusetts for health care mandates — the heart of the case at the Supreme Court — would make it impossible for him to wage an effective campaign against the president in the fall .“He’s the worst candidate to go against Barack Obama . He can’t make it the argument , ” Mr. Santorum said . “If he makes it the argument , the Obama machine will turn it right back on him.”In an interview on CNN Monday afternoon , Mr. Romney dismissed Mr. Santorum’s criticisms , saying that “I’m not going to worry too much about what Rick is saying these days.”He added that “I will repeal Obamacare and I will stop it in its tracks on day one.”In an earlier interview on CNN , Newt Gingrich conceded that he had once supported a health care mandate , but said he always demanded an “opt-out” for people who did not want to pay for health insurance .“I always said there had to be an opt-out clause , ” Mr. Gingrich said . “My guess is they are going to find it unconstitutional.”On Sunday , Mr. Santorum used an expletive and criticized a New York Times reporter for seeking clarification about the “worst Republican” comments . Asked about his exchange with the reporter , Jeff Zeleny , Mr. Santorum said he had no regrets .“I don’t regret taking on a New York Times reporter who was out of line , ” Mr. Santorum said . “If you are conservative and you haven’t taken on a New York Times reporter , you aren’t worth your salt.”Mr. Santorum’s campaign used the exchange Sunday in an e-mailed fund-raising appeal on Monday .Mr. Romney held a campaign event Monday morning in California . But even as he stayed thousands of miles away from Washington , his campaign tried to shift the spotlight to Mr. Obama’s absence , not his .Speaking at a medical device company in San Diego , Mr. Romney criticized the president’s reforms as burdensome on the health care industry .“There are a lot of reasons not to like Obamacare , ” Mr. Romney said . “Among them , of course , an extra trillion dollars of spending . We were told it would be an extra trillion . Now we’re told by the C.B.O . it’s more like two trillion dollars . And then they said it would cut the cost of health insurance . In fact it has increased the cost of health insurance.”Mr. Romney did not — as he usually does — specifically call for the repeal of the health care law . And he did not mention Mr. Santorum or the arguments going on at the court . But he accused Mr. Obama and his allies of misleading the American people about what would happen after the law went into effect .“There was the story that Obamacare , if you wanted to keep your current insurance , you could , ” he said . “But now we find out that some 30 percent of employers in America say that when it goes into effect they will drop their employee coverage , and instead have them go to Obamacare.”Ashley Parker and Sabrina Tavernise contributed reporting .
A Tea Party commission trying to âcrowd-sourceâ a plan to reduce the federal budget deficit says it found broad support for repealing the health care legislation passed last year and eliminating entire federal departments , but much less enthusiasm for changes to Medicare and Social Security .Those programs are two of the biggest contributors to the nationâs deficit . Still , the Tea Party Debt Commission says that its proposals , which will be released in preliminary form on Tuesday , add up to $ 6 trillion in savings over 10 years â more than the reductions proposed by President Obama , or Representative Paul Ryan , a Republican from Wisconsin who is the chairman of the House Budget Committee , or the report of a bipartisan commission last year .The Tea Party commission is hoping that with the help of conservative senators , it can influence the work of a bipartisan panel of 12 lawmakers that has been charged with finding at least $ 1.2 trillion in cuts over the next decade .A copy of the preliminary findings was provided to The New York Times . A more formal report of the commissionâs plans will be presented at a hearing on Capitol Hill on Nov. 17 â a week before the bipartisan panel is expected to complete its recommendations .The Tea Party commission was formed by FreedomWorks , the libertarian advocacy group that is led by Dick Armey , the former House majority leader , and was one of the first organizations to cultivate the Tea Party . FreedomWorks named 12 commissioners and held nine hearings across the country where it gave presentations on the budget deficit and solicited ideas on how to cut it .The group also set up a Web site on which people were presented a series of choices about what to cut from the budget .âWhat weâre trying to prove , â said Adam Brandon , a spokesman for FreedomWorks , âis that No . 1 , thereâs popular support for cuts , and that No . 2 , it is possible to make the cuts that weâre talking about without raising new revenue.âThe commissionâs preliminary recommendations tend to be ideas that conservatives have long supported . The FreedomWorks presentation argued that raising taxes could not balance the budget .The menu of choices on the debt commission Web site did not include options Democrats have suggested ; for instance , requiring hedge fund managers to pay ordinary tax rates , rather than the lower 15 percent they pay now on so-called carried interest income .Instead , would-be budget architects were offered stark choices : Would you prefer to reduce Social Security benefits for those with high incomes or raise the retirement age for Social Security to 70 ? End all foreign aid or eliminate the Department of Energy ? Eliminate ethanol tax credits or end farm subsidies ? Other proposals included privatizing air traffic control , reducing the pay for federal employees by 10 percent and eliminating AmeriCorps , the youth volunteer program .A FreedomWorks memo on the preliminary findings said that more than 40,000 people visited the Web site to make recommendations for cuts .The most popular idea , supported by 93 percent , was repealing what the site referred to as âObamacare , â the health care overhaul legislation passed in March 2010 . After that , the most popular ideas were reducing duplicative purchases of Pentagon supplies ( 90 percent ) , eliminating the Department of Education and privatizing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ( 81 percent each ) , and reducing discretionary spending to 2008 levels ( 76 percent ) .When it comes to cutting Medicare , Medicaid and Social Security , the report said visitors to the site were âmore cautious , â and âprefer reductions in peripheral elements , â like tightening eligibility for Social Security disability payments and reducing subsidies to teaching hospitals .The report said that the top 10 choices would add up to $ 6 trillion in savings . But some of these proposals are vague or subject to year-to-year change ( selling âunderusedâ federal buildings , ending earmarks ) . Others are subject to dispute : FreedomWorks says that repealing the health care legislation would cut $ 1.2 trillion , but the Congressional Budget Office has projected that repealing the legislation would actually increase the deficit by $ 210 billion over the next 10 years .Still , the report offers some sense of how the Tea Party might influence the debate when the joint Congressional panel makes its recommendations in November .The staff of Senator Mike Lee of Utah , a Republican who was elected last year with heavy Tea Party support , will conduct the November hearing on the Tea Party plan .The 12-member Congressional committee , named as part of the deficit reduction deal in August , will release its proposal for at least $ 1.2 trillion in cuts over 10 years by Nov. 23 . If a majority of its members can agree , the House and Senate must vote on their proposal by Dec. 23 .
A Times reader , Tom Bird , of East Lansing , Mich. , raised a timely issue , given all that’s happening in Washington . He wrote that other news organizations , including The Associated Press , are putting the expression “Obamacare” in quotation marks , “signifying that it is not a neutral expression , but instead is political rhetoric that is being used in a partisan way.” And he added , “When will The Times wake up ? ”A quick search of Times news stories turned up only one recent example of the phrase being used in the manner Mr. Bird mentioned . It came in a prototypically Times-like headline on the front of the Sunday business section : “On the Threshold of Obamacare , Warily.” ( The word also appears regularly , without quotes , on the Economix blog where one recent headline read : “How to Gut Obamacare.” )But , for the most part , the news pages are using what I view as the equivalent of quotation marks – a description of the phrase , which provides the same kind of distance as quotation marks would . Here’s an example:… federal officials declined to discuss whether they had found design flaws in their system , but their comments appeared to place most of the blame on the sheer volume of traffic . They pronounced themselves pleased , saying that the intense interest showed a pent-up demand that demonstrated the need for the Affordable Care Act , the 2010 law known as Obamacare , which created the exchanges .I asked Philip B. Corbett , the associate managing editor for standards , about the guidelines for the expression in the news pages . “For the most part , we have not used ‘Obamacare’ as our standard term in news stories outside of quotations , ” he said . “Aside from the question of whether it’s politically charged , the term strikes me as informal – essentially a nickname – which is not our normal style for straight news articles . Most often we simply use a straightforward description , like ‘the health care law’ or ‘the health care overhaul , ’ or occasionally the formal name , the Affordable Care Act.”However , in the opinion pages of The Times , where different style guidelines often apply , many examples crop up of Obamacare without quotation marks or description . Columnists including Frank Bruni , Charles Blow and Paul Krugman have used the phrase – acceptably , I think – in the context of their overall viewpoints and individual voices .A reader , Paul Teichert , in mentioning a Joe Nocera column in which the phrase was used , expressed his displeasure : “Why become part of the conservative media echo chamber ? ” he wrote . “I wish that in future The Times would adopt a policy of calling it solely the Affordable Care Act rather than sounding like those who have disdain for the act and our president.”As for just how politically charged the phrase is , that can be debated . A look back to last year found a Times article about leading Democrats’ change of heart in embracing the term . Even the president seemed to be picking it up .Of course , that was then . Just last week , the ABC talk show host Jimmy Kimmel sent a camera crew out to the streets to query citizens about whether they preferred Obamacare or the Affordable Care Act . They may mean one and the same thing , but people reacted negatively to the first and more positively to the second .That’s far from a scientific poll , of course , but it makes the point that – as The Times’s readers point out – language choice matters .
A college student came to me recently with a quandary . He’d spent the summer interning at a conservative think tank . Now he was applying to schools and companies where most people were liberal . Should he remove the internship from his résumé ?I advised him not to . Even if people disagreed with his politics , I argued , they’d still appreciate his public spiritedness . But now I’m thinking that advice was wrong . There’s a lot more political discrimination than I thought . In fact , the best recent research suggests that there’s more political discrimination than there is racial discrimination .For example , political scientists Shanto Iyengar and Sean Westwood gave 1,000 people student résumés and asked them which students should get scholarships . The résumés had some racial cues ( membership in African-American Students Association ) and some political cues ( member of Young Republicans ) .Race influenced decisions . Blacks favored black students 73 percent to 27 percent , and whites favored black students slightly . But political cues were more powerful . Both Democrats and Republicans favored students who agreed with them 80 percent of the time . They favored students from their party even when other students had better credentials .Iyengar and Westwood conducted other experiments to measure what Cass Sunstein of Harvard Law School calls “partyism.” They gave subjects implicit association tests , which measure whether people associate different qualities with positive or negative emotions . They had people play the trust game , which measures how much people are willing to trust different kinds of people .In those situations , they found pervasive prejudice . And political biases were stronger than their racial biases .In a Bloomberg View column last month , Sunstein pointed to polling data that captured the same phenomenon . In 1960 , roughly 5 percent of Republicans and Democrats said they’d be “displeased” if their child married someone from the other party . By 2010 , 49 percent of Republicans and 33 percent of Democrats said they would mind .Politics is obviously a passionate activity , in which moral values clash . Debates over Obamacare , charter schools or whether the United States should intervene in Syria stir serious disagreement . But these studies are measuring something different . People’s essential worth is being measured by a political label : whether they should be hired , married , trusted or discriminated against .The broad social phenomenon is that as personal life is being de-moralized , political life is being hyper-moralized . People are less judgmental about different lifestyles , but they are more judgmental about policy labels .The features of the hyper-moralized mind-set are all around . More people are building their communal and social identities around political labels . Your political label becomes the prerequisite for membership in your social set .Politics becomes a marker for basic decency . Those who are not members of the right party are deemed to lack basic compassion , or basic loyalty to country .Finally , political issues are no longer just about themselves ; they are symbols of worth and dignity . When many rural people defend gun rights , they’re defending the dignity and respect of rural values against urban snobbery .There are several reasons politics has become hyper-moralized in this way . First , straight moral discussion has atrophied . There used to be public theologians and philosophers who discussed moral issues directly . That kind of public intellectual is no longer prominent , so moral discussion is now done under the guise of policy disagreement , often by political talk-show hosts .Second , highly educated people are more likely to define themselves by what they believe than by their family religion , ethnic identity or region .Third , political campaigns and media provocateurs build loyalty by spreading the message that electoral disputes are not about whether the top tax rate will be 36 percent or 39 percent , but are about the existential fabric of life itself .The problem is that hyper-moralization destroys politics . Most of the time , politics is a battle between competing interests or an attempt to balance partial truths . But in this fervent state , it turns into a Manichaean struggle of light and darkness . To compromise is to betray your very identity . When schools , community groups and workplaces get defined by political membership , when speakers get disinvited from campus because they are beyond the pale , then every community gets dumber because they can’t reap the benefits of diverging viewpoints and competing thought .This mentality also ruins human interaction . There is a tremendous variety of human beings within each political party . To judge human beings on political labels is to deny and ignore what is most important about them . It is to profoundly devalue them . That is the core sin of prejudice , whether it is racism or partyism .The personal is not political . If you’re judging a potential daughter-in-law on political grounds , your values are out of whack .
A few weeks ago , Ezra Klein and Ben Domenech had a fairly detailed back-and-forth — culminating in this mano-a-mano exchange — about whether a Republican or conservative alternative to Obamacare actually exists . You can read or watch them go at it and form your own judgment , but I think the answer is pretty straightforward : A conservative alternative or alternatives , yes ; an alternative that Republican lawmakers are ready to vote for , no .That gap between conservative policy wonks and G.O.P . politicians has been with us for some time , but last week supplied a particularly stark reminder of its existence . Nearly all of the plausible conservative blueprints for reform involve increased funding for high-risk pools where people with pre-existing conditions can purchase insurance , as an alternative to regulations requiring that insurers cover all applicants regardless of their health status . These pools exist under Obamacare as well , but they’re purely transitional and deeply underfunded — and this underfunding provided an opportunity that Eric Cantor and the House Republican leadership tried to exploit last week , with a bill that would have shifted $ 3.6 billion in money that’s basically being used as the Health and Human Services Department’s discretionary fund into the federal high-risk pool instead .Instead , the bill died because , well , too many House Republicans didn’t want to vote for it . I’ll let Domenech explain the policy and political malpractice at work here ( the quote is from his email newsletter , The Transom ) :The Cantor-sponsored shift would’ve accomplished a couple of political goals : it would’ve bolstered a high-risk pool based approach to pre-existing conditions , which has generally been favored on the right , and it would’ve hampered Sebelius’s ability to shift dollars around at whim without going back to Congress for approval . As such , it seems a logical move which doesn’t wed Republicans to any long term policy positions regarding Obamacare …As they tend to do , however , fiscal conservatives split on Cantor effort . It was opposed by the Heritage Foundation , the Club for Growth , and “Tea Party leader” Brent Bozell . Redstate announced it would be scoring the vote … They described the step , in insulting fashion to anyone who understands the policy involved , as an Obamacare “fix” …This type of strategic idiocy has been the mark of conservatives throughout the process of Obamacare’s passage and implementation , so expecting them to be smarter now is probably too much to ask . Whatever the motives of the conservatives who opposed this measure , they have accomplished the following ultimate goal : they’ve made leadership less likely to take up any possible wedge legislation on implementation ; they’ve missed an opportunity to bolster the argument that Republicans care about pre-existing conditions ; and , most importantly , they’ve made it easier for Sebelius to implement the law …So what were opponents thinking ? Well , here’s one opponent’s explanation:“The issue I think many of us are having with this particular piece of legislation … you’re replacing one big government program with another big government program , ” said Representative Raul Labrador of Idaho …… he added : “Subsidizing health care is not what Republicans should be about . Republicans should be about managing health care” to lower costs for Americans .And therein lies the rub , because you can’t actually have a conservative alternative to Obamacare if you can’t recognize that “managing” the health care system requires changing the way it ( already , pre-Obama ! ) subsidizes health care , which in turn requires increasing the subsidies available to at least some people ( the sick , and Americans who don’t get insurance through their employers ) even as you reduce them for others ( by capping the deduction for health insurance , as a first step ) . It’s true that this kind of change is a “big government program” relative to the libertarian utopia , but relative to the status quo it’s nothing of the sort , and anyway I don’t see many Republican congressmen casting bold votes to actually eliminate the health-insurance tax exclusion . Instead , they’re happy to just pretend that the existing system represents some sort of free-market ideal in order to score points against the new health care law and avoid taking on any policy risk themselves — and then happy , as in this case , to demagogue as “big government” any constructive steps toward a world that’s actually more consonant with free market principles than the status quo .This , this , is the Republican Party’s health care problem . It isn’t that conservative ideas about health policy don’t exist , and it isn’t that they won’t work . It’s that right now the feasibility question is purely academic , because even after five years of debating these issues , and despite Eric Cantor’s best efforts , there still aren’t enough Republican lawmakers willing to take even the smallest of steps toward putting those ideas to the test . This means that no matter how much of a “bureaucratic nightmare” the implementation of the current health care law turns out to be , liberals at least have this ace in the hole : When it comes to health care reform , there is still no politically realistic alternative to their approach .

A few weeks out from Election Day 2014 , some Democrats running for re-election to the United States Senate in heavily Republican states are running away from President Obama’s record .And boy , a lot of New York Times readers are fed up .“Just once I’d like to hear a Democratic Senate candidate point out that millions now have health care when they did not before , ” Robert Zisgen wrote from Mahwah , N.J .Mr. Obama “ended two wars and thus is saving blood and treasure , ” Mr. Zisgen continued . “Perhaps they could mention that the stock market has done very well.”But no . Instead , when asked about their votes in support of Mr. Obama’s agenda , some candidates are asking , “President who ? ”So it was that readers provided a barometer of President Obama’s low approval ratings and a sense of frustration with Democratic candidates in comments on Wednesday’s lead editorial , “The Democratic Panic : Alison Lundergan Grimes , Kay Hagan and Other Candidates Avoid Obama.” The Times received 1,554 comments and published 1,134 . A majority expressed frustration with Democrats’ lack of enthusiasm for Democratic policy . Some expressed pride in the president . And others shared the Republican hope that Democrats will end up with what they see as a well-deserved defeat .“The panicky Democratic flight away from President Obama — and from some of the party’s most important positions — is not a surprise , ” the editorial board wrote . “Mr . Obama remains highly unpopular among white voters , particularly in Southern states.”Thus , it’s a challenge to assemble a winning coalition for incumbent Democrats such as Senators Mark Pryor of Arkansas ; Mark Begich in Alaska ; Mary Landrieu of Louisiana ; and Kay Hagan of North Carolina . Alison Lundergan Grimes , a Senate candidate in Kentucky , and Michelle Nunn in Georgia are also running as centrists and eschewing comparisons to the president .Many readers said that offering weak Democratic broth , or trying to blend in politically with Republicans , is bad strategy and poor inspiration for apathetic voters .“As we say out here , the only thing in the middle of the road are lane lines and road kill , ” P Robison wrote from Wyoming . “Really , who cares if we get Republican or Republican-Lite ? ”Some readers said Democrats are merely reaping the political consequences of Mr. Obama’s unpopular policies .“They helped vote him in and now have to live with the consequences of his failed policies , the damage done to this great country and to their own campaigns , ” Chuck in Houston wrote . “Maybe they should own up to it.”Voters on the liberal side of the spectrum expressed disappointment , but for different reasons . As the editorial board wrote : “By not standing firmly for their own policies , Democrats send a message to voters that the unending Republican criticism of the president is legitimate.”Many readers shared that assessment . The problem is “the failure of his colleagues in Congress and the Democratic Party to stand beside” the president , Colleen Gillard wrote from Cambridge , Mass . “Can’t think of another Democratic president in history who has been so abandoned.”Others advised Democrats to “get a backbone , ” as one reader put it .A few readers pointed out that Democrats face special challenges in off-year elections , when they must appeal to centrists , as Democratic voters historically have turned out at lower rates than Republicans .That dynamic among likely voters weakens the appeal of the Affordable Care Act , for example , which the editorial board described as “one of the most far-reaching and beneficial laws to have been passed by Congress in years.”“I suspect part of the problem is that the beneficiaries of Obamacare are disproportionately members of groups ( young , low-income , etc . ) regarded as having a relatively low propensity to vote , particularly in mid-terms , ” Paul McDonough wrote from California .Several readers said Democrats need a fundamental change in tactics . “The Democrats are running on fear rather than expressing outrage , as President Harry Truman did so successfully , ” Paul wrote from Long Island .Some said Democrats making weak policy arguments are just laying the groundwork for policy failure .“Cowards , ” Tom J. in Berwyn wrote . “Even if they win , we get a Senate full of more cowards , who let a Republican minority steamroll over everything.”Democrats’ sense of being dispirited ran through many comments .“These Democratic politicians stand for self perpetuation without regard to integrity , ” Corrinna in Boulder , Colo. , wrote . “I can barely bring myself to vote.”Still , some readers agreed with the editorial board’s view that the stimulus bill was vital in pulling the country out of the recession , and “there is much that is going right in this country.”“Like him or not , the economy is steadily improving and more Americans have health insurance , ” Margaret Bradley in Fayetteville , Ga. , wrote . “I’m sure those auto workers were happy to get their jobs back.”
A group seeking to persuade young people to “opt out” of President Obama’s health care law posted videos on YouTube Thursday that show young patients on exam tables recoiling in fear as a character the group is calling “Creepy Uncle Sam” appears out of nowhere and looms over them .The group , Generation Opportunity , said in a news release that the videos were part of a new , six-figure campaign to educate people between the ages of 18 and 29 about “alternatives to expensive and creepy Obamacare exchanges.”Starting Oct. 1 , uninsured Americans will be able to shop for health insurance through new online markets , or exchanges , in every state . Many low- and middle-income people will qualify for federal subsidies to help cover the cost . The Obama administration is eager for healthy young people to enroll in the exchanges , to help offset the cost of insuring older and sicker people .Evan Feinberg , the president of Generation Opportunity , said in an interview that the group would spend “close to three-quarters of a million dollars” on the campaign , which will include not just online videos but also events at college football games , music festivals and other gatherings that tend to draw young adults . The group will ask young people to pledge not to sign up for insurance through the exchanges , Mr. Feinberg said .“We talk to folks on a daily basis about what their options are — that they have ability to pay the penalty and buy health coverage that better meets their needs and their budget , ” he said .Under the Affordable Care Act , starting in January , most Americans who do not have health insurance will have to pay a tax penalty . In the first year , it will be $ 95 , or 1 percent of family income , whichever is higher .Generation Opportunity is based in Virginia , but Mr. Feinberg said the campaign would be national . The group received $ 5 million last year from Freedom Partners , a nonprofit with ties to Charles G. and David H. Koch , according to tax filings . Mr. Feinberg said he worked at the Charles Koch Institute before joining Generation Opportunity earlier this year .One of the videos shows a nurse escorting a young woman into an exam room , saying , “I see you chose to sign up for Obamacare.” It then shows the young woman in a hospital gown , putting her feet in stirrups for a gynecological exam . Then the Uncle Sam character pops up at the end of the exam table , the young woman screams , and the words , “Don’t let government play doctor” and “Opt out of Obamacare” flash on the screen .The videos quickly drew criticism from supporters of the health care law . Brad Woodhouse , president of Americans United for Change , a left-leaning advocacy group , called them “sick , dishonest , vile and dangerous ads to scare young people into going without health insurance.”Ilyse Hogue , president of Naral Pro-Choice America , said in a statement that the video featuring the young woman “not only defiles our American mascot but disturbingly compared the A.C.A . to sexual assault.”Mr. Feinberg dismissed such criticism , saying , “All the ad suggests is that Uncle Sam will play doctor.”He added : “I’ll tell you this , we got some early feedback from folks on college campuses . A lot of people are planning on dressing as Creepy Uncle Sam for Halloween.”
A paradox of American politics is that Republicans take organized labor more seriously than Democrats do .The right sees unions as a mainstay of the left , a crucial source of cash , campaign manpower and votes .“Unions are the largest player in American politics and they will be for some time , ” Grover Norquist , the president of Americans for Tax Reform , declared in March at the Conservative Political Action Conference . “Fourteen million Americans have to pay union dues . If they average $ 500 , and that is a low estimate , that’s a $ 7 billion slush fund for the left.”Democrats are happy to get labor’s votes and money , but they have done little to revitalize the besieged movement .“The unions basically have become an A.T.M . for Democrats , ” Steve Rosenthal , a former political director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. , told me in a phone conversation . “There is a sense of taking unions for granted , no place else to go , don’t need to do much for them.”Republicans are willing to go to great lengths to weaken the union movement , especially at the state level . Even as the strength of organized labor as a whole declines , conservatives view unions that represent public sector employees , in particular , as anathema . They are desperate to gut the power of the 7.2 million organized government workers — who range from teachers , to clerks in the Department of Motor Vehicles , to social workers , public hospital employees , meat and poultry inspectors , road workers , property tax auditors and civil servants in general . These are the employees who populate the extensive bureaucracies that the right loathes .Unions the right has targeted include the American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees , the Service Employees International Union , the American Federation of Government Employees , the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers .Reince Priebus , chairman of the Republican National Committee , appearing at the same C.P.A.C . event as Norquist , boasted that in Wisconsin the successful drive to render public sector unions impotent was the result of a coordinated effort between the party and the conservative movement:The anti-union alliance between the Republican Party and movement conservatives got a big boost on Nov. 4 . The heroes of this anti-union drive , Scott Walker , the governor of Wisconsin , and Rick Snyder , the governor of Michigan , were re-elected in states with a long history of strong labor movements . Prospects for the enactment of additional anti-labor legislation also improved as Republicans made substantial gains in legislatures and governor’s races across the country .After the 2010 election , Republicans had complete control ( governor and both legislative branches ) in 21 states , almost double the 11 states with complete Democatic control . Now , 24 states are fully in Republican hands ; Democrats dominate in just 7 .The 2014 election was “a major political defeat for the unions , particularly state-wide public sector unions , because it shows how much the voting public sees unions as part of the problem of persistent unemployment and underemployment , rather than being part of the solution , ” Gary Chaison , a professor of industrial relations at Clark University , replied in response to my email . Chaison’s assessment:By 2013 , 11.3 percent of wage and salary workers were covered by unions , down from 23.4 percent in 1983 .Republicans have good reason to target public sector unions . Without them , the share of the work force represented by unions would be even smaller than it is now . By last year , union coverage of private sector workers had fallen to 7.5 percent , from a high of roughly 35 percent in the mid-1950s . Government workers today make up 15.8 percent of the total work force , but union representation of this sliver has grown from less than 10 percent in the 1950s to 35.3 percent .Norquist told the C.P.A.C . conference that conservatives hadn’t taken on public employee unions in the mistaken belief that “you can’t do anything about the public sector . The rules are set , and they elect the guys who set the rules.” But Walker’s success in winning a recall election , and in getting re-elected , has permanently changed thinking on the right , Norquist declared . By this reasoning , Walker’s survival and ultimate triumph demonstrates that changing the rules to make it more difficult to organize public workers , to collect dues and to bargain over wages and fringe benefits is politically viable , even in a Northern state .In 2011 , when Walker first took office , 37 percent of the nation’s 21-plus million public sector employees were union members ; by 2012 , this dropped to 35.9 percent ; and last year , it fell to 35.3 percent .If Republicans and conservatives place a top priority on eviscerating labor unions , what is the Democratic Party doing to protect this core constituency ? Not much .In fact , the Obama administration has undermined the bargaining leverage of the most successful unions by imposing a 40 percent excise tax , which takes effect in 2018 , on health insurance premiums in excess of $ 10,200 annually for individuals , and $ 27,500 for families , in order to finance Obamacare . The provision , which covers what many of labor’s enemies call “Cadillac plans , ” has provoked an angry response from labor leaders . They see the tax as threatening the continued survival of key health insurance benefits that unions have won as part of total employee compensation packages .In an email to me , Joel Parker , national vice president of the merged Transportation Communications International Union and International Association of Machinists , wrote about the consequences of the new excise tax:Democrats neglect the union movement at their peril . Not only does organized labor provide millions of dollars – the Center for Responsive Politics reports that unions spent $ 116.5 million on politics in 2013-14 – but union members are a loyal Democratic constituency . On Nov. 4 , the 17 percent of voters who come from union households supported Democratic House candidates by a margin of 22 points , 60-38 , while the remaining 83 percent from non-union households supported Republicans 54-44 .Rosenthal , the former A.F.L.-C.I.O . political director , has compiled 2008 exit poll data showing that white men , white weekly churchgoers , gun owners , veterans and whites without college degrees who were union members cast majorities for Obama , while members of these usually strongly Republican groups who were nonunion backed John McCain , often by large margins .Gun owners , for example , backed McCain over Obama 62-37 , while gun owners who were members of unions backed Obama 56-44 . White men chose McCain over Obama 57-41 , but white men who were members of union households backed Obama 59-41 .The Democratic percentage among union voters has stayed consistently in the 60 percent range for the past two decades , but the absolute number of labor votes has dropped as membership has fallen . Organized labor’s share of the electorate has shrunk , according to Rosenthal’s data , from 27 percent in 2000 to 17 percent in 2014 .Rosenthal was struck by the comment made by one man during a focus group that he organized in New Brunswick , N.J. , in late 2012 . At the time , the state’s governor , Chris Christie , had been attacking both the state teachers union and public employee pension funds .“This guy stood up and said ‘My father is a cop , my brother is a cop . They have pensions , I don’t , and it really pisses me off , ’ ” Rosenthal recounted . “Damn it , this guy was talking about his father and brother . He was pissed that his own father and brother had pensions.”The comment reflects the success of the Republican strategy of pitting those who see themselves as taxpayers against public sector unions , viewed by many as takers .Christie has called the New Jersey Education Association “a group of political thugs , ” a union that has become “fat and rich and entitled.”Walker , who was re-elected governor of Wisconsin with 52.3 percent to his opponent’s 46.6 percent , explicitly summarized the strategy when he first took office in January 2011:If , as many Democrats privately acknowledge , unions remain an important linchpin in the party’s coalition , Democrats have their work cut out for them . The Republican drive to victory in state and local elections continues in defiance of large-scale demographic trends that are supposed to benefit Democrats .A vast majority of gubernatorial elections — 39 states’ worth — are held in nonpresidential years when the electorate is smaller and more conservative than it is in presidential years , and it is at the state and local level where decisions crucial to the future of organized labor are made . Figure 1 , a map of Republican and Democratic House districts in the aftermath of the 2014 elections reflects the scope of Republican domination .The economic forces working against unions , especially private sector unions – globalization , the shift of income from labor to capital , foreign imports , automation , the decline of manufacturing jobs – are inexorable . The Republican Party recognizes this vulnerability and is taking steps to go in for the kill . For both Walker and Christie , attacks on public sector unions – confronting teachers is a specialty of both men — are crucial to their potential bids for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 .Democrats themselves — President Obama and members of Congress – recognize that the odds are against them . Even when the party had full control of both houses of Congress and the White House in 2009 , Democrats gave a less than halfhearted effort to pass labor’s top priority : legislation that would make elections for union representation easier .Democratic strategists looking toward the future are focused on “the rising American electorate” — single women , minorities and the young , with no reference to labor .At the same time , many voters in the Republican electorate are themselves middle and low income . In 2014 , 67 percent of those who cast Republican ballots earned less than $ 100,000 in household income ; 30.4 percent made less than $ 50,000 . Republicans face their own problems remaining competitive in presidential elections , which will only worsen if they do not strengthen their support among these less affluent voters .But even with labor unions no longer the force they were — and in fact in part because of their decline — the pressure will fall on both parties to more effectively represent the interests and rights of economically struggling voters , who at some point will refuse to tolerate their eroding income and lack of opportunity .
ALEXANDRIA , Va. — Last week , with the midterm elections fast approaching , the conservative website Independent Journal Review was not focused on the control of the Senate or crucial statehouse races . Instead , it led its home page with a gruesome beheading on Long Island and a video of a belligerent drunk being arrested at a Dallas airport .But sprinkled throughout the attention-grabbing fare was a steady stream of articles critical of President Obama and other Democrats . “Obama’s schedule from today shows how toxic he is to Democrats running for Senate , ” read one headline . Another asked , “Did Hillary intentionally talk over a crowd singing ‘Happy Birthday’ to her ? ” ( The sub-headline : “If elected president , she would be the second oldest in history.” )IJReview , a two-year-old site started by a pair of Republican operatives , has emerged as one of the most popular online destinations for conservatives . The site mixes entertaining , shareable topics like pets through a conservative-values lens ( for example , a recent piece about a dog helping to heal a sick veteran ) with articles about politics and policy .“It’s like if you crossed RedState with BuzzFeed , ” said Alex Castellanos , a Republican political consultant and an adviser to IJReview .IJReview has roughly 24 million unique visitors a month , according to the most recent Quantcast rankings . Its traffic exceeds that of more seasoned right-wing sites like the Drudge Report , Newsmax and Breitbart News , and is not far behind other conservative brands like Fox News and TheBlaze .The site’s founders , Alex Skatell and Phil Musser , say that its popularity comes from having mastered “social sharing” on websites like Facebook and Google . They boast of the ability to generate maximum traffic from a minimum number of articles . In August , for instance , IJReview received 14 million shares on Facebook from just 646 articles , according to NewsWhip , a site that tracks social sharing . By contrast , Huffington Post , the leader in Facebook shares , had four times as many shares at nearly 55 million , but with 38 times as many articles .Such a model has economic advantages . IJReview generates revenues in the low seven figures a month , up 500 percent from this time a year ago , the men said . The Media Group will earn revenue of $ 30 million this year , they said . While they declined to disclose their bottom line , Mr. Musser said , “we have been profitable from Day 1.”When Mr. Skatell , a former digital director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee , looked to start a site after the 2012 election , he saw a huge gap in reaching what he calls “a more mainstream center-right audience.” He teamed with Mr. Musser , a former executive director of the Republican Governors Association . The two “bonded over being generally dispirited about our party’s approach to all things digital , ” Mr. Musser said .They pledged to change things . “We shared a goal of building a new ecosystem to communicate our message , ” Mr. Musser said , “and to develop practitioners who could deliver it.” Mr. Skatell , 28 , had already earned a reputation as a digital wunderkind in the Republican Party . At 22 , he started the Republican Governors Association’s first Facebook page and increased online fund-raising .He had also started his own Facebook page , called Conservative Daily , that aggregated stories across the web . Mr. Skatell experimented with how to promote the page ( including paid ads ) , and it took off , inspiring him to start IJReview as an independent website .Using $ 40,000 he had saved from a game app he made in college and $ 20,000 from his parents , he hired Bert Atkinson , a friend known as Bubba who had been working as a waiter , as editor and chief writer .While the site continued repackaging content from others with eye-catching headlines , Mr. Atkinson and a growing staff began adding their own content too , like amusing explainers of current events . They also began to be fed content by readers . When Mr. Obama told a factory worker at a plant that he had been using Obamacare the wrong way , IJReview received a video of the exchange and posted it .In 2013 , Mr. Skatell joined with Mr. Musser to build a larger company . At the time , IJReview was still receiving fewer than two million unique viewers a month . The men started to focus on audience development .“We put more of an emphasis on watching how our audience responded to certain content , tracking real-time analytics much more closely , and lastly reinvesting in growing our distribution channels : Facebook and email lists , ” Mr. Skatell said .A breakthrough insight was figuring out that if they could identify readers who felt strongly about health care and alert them to all their Affordable Care Act articles , there was a higher likelihood they would share them . Putting the right content in front of the right audience became their mantra . Traffic took off . “There is an art and science to this , ” Mr. Musser said .IJReview’s roughly 30 reporters and editors work from an open-office space in Old Town Alexandria , Va. At a recent news meeting , the young staff members sat on beanbags while brainstorming how to compare the Obama administration to characters in the 1990s sitcom “The Fresh Prince of Bel Air.” ( The idea never panned out . ) The half-dozen reporters at the meeting said they did not do reporting outside the office , although one ventured she would look up something health-related on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website .The IJReview’s lighter approach belies the deep political focus in the rest of Mr. Skatell’s and Mr. Musser’s business , Media Group of America . The 62-employee company also runs IMGE , a digital consulting firm for Republican candidates and corporate clients , and IMGE Labs , which builds technical tools like mobile apps for clients , also largely Republican campaigns .Mr. Skatell and Mr. Musser said they plan for the site to widen its reach by becoming a platform for other viewpoints — including Democrats . That could alienate their core readers , but they say they believe that will not happen because of their ability to target specific content to specific readers .For now , their audience reflects the typical conservative base , with an outsize share of readers under 18 and over 45 . A broader base would be good for politics and good for business . “This isn’t just a Republican primary voter play , ” said Mr. Castellanos , the consultant . “It is much bigger and more valuable.”
AT the recent New York Times forum in Singapore , Eleonora Sharef , a co-founder of HireArt , was explaining what new skills employers were seeking from job applicants , but she really got the audienceâs attention when she mentioned that her search firm was recently told by one employer that it wouldnât look at any applicant for a marketing job who didnât have at least 2,000 Twitter followers â and the more the better . She didnât disclose the name of the firm , but she told me that it wasnât Twitter .At a meeting with students at Fudan University in Shanghai a few days earlier , I was struck by how anxious some of the Chinese students were about the question : âAm I going to have a job ? â If youâre a software engineer in China , youâll do fine , also a factory worker â but a plain-old college grad ? The Times reported earlier this year that in China today âamong people in their early 20s , those with a college degree were four times as likely to be unemployed as those with only an elementary school education.âStories like these explain why I really hope that Obamacare succeeds . Say what ?Hereâs the logic : The Cold War era I grew up in was a world of insulated walls , both geopolitical and economic , so the pace of change was slower â you could work for the same company for 30 years â and because bosses had fewer alternatives , unions had greater leverage . The result was a middle class built on something called a high-wage or a decent-wage medium-skilled job , and the benefits that went with it .The proliferation of such jobs meant that many people could lead a middle-class lifestyle â with less education and more security â because they didnât have to compete so directly with either a computer or a machine that could do their jobs faster and better ( by far the biggest source of job churn ) or against an Indian or Chinese who would do their jobs cheaper . And by a middle-class lifestyle , I donât mean just scraping by . I mean having status : enough money to buy a house , enjoy some leisure and offer your kids the opportunity to do better than you .But thanks to the merger of globalization and the I.T . revolution that has unfolded over the last two decades â which is rapidly and radically transforming how knowledge and information are generated , disseminated and collaborated on to create value â âthe high-wage , medium-skilled job is over , â says Stefanie Sanford , the chief of global policy and advocacy for the College Board . The only high-wage jobs that will support the kind of middle-class lifestyle of old will be high-skilled ones , requiring a commitment to rigorous education , adaptability and innovation , she added .But will even this prescription for creating enough jobs with decent middle-class incomes suffice , asks James Manyika , who leads research on economic and technology trends atÂ the McKinsey Global Institute . While these prescriptions are certainly âcorrect , â notes Manyika , they âmay not beÂ enough to solve for the scale and nature ofÂ the problem.âÂ The pace of technologically driven productivity growth , he said , suggests that we may not need as many workersÂ to drive equivalent levels of output and G.D.P .As the M.I.T . economists Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee show in their book âRace Against the Machine , â for the last two centuries productivity , median income and employment all rose together . No longer . Now we have record productivity , wealth and innovation , yet median incomes are falling , inequality is rising and high unemployment remains persistent .To be sure , notes Manyika , a similar thing happened when we introduced technology to agriculture . We did not need as many people to produce food , so everybody shifted to manufacturing . As the same thing happened there , many people shifted to services .But now , adds Manyika , âa growing share of high-paying services and knowledge work is alsoÂ falling prey to technology.â And while new companies like Twitter are exciting , they do not employ people with high-paying jobs in large numbers . The economy and the service sector will still offer large numbers of jobs , but many simply may not sustain a true middle-class lifestyle .As a result , argues Manyika , how we think about âemploymentâ to sustain a middle-class lifestyle may need to expand âto include a broader set of possibilities for generating incomeâ compared with the traditional job , with benefits and a well-grooved career path . To be in the middle class , you may need to consider not only high-skilled jobs , âbut also more nontraditional forms of work , â explained Manyika . Work itself may have to be thought of as âa form of entrepreneurshipâ where you draw on all kinds of assets and skills to generate income .This could mean leveraging your skills through Task Rabbit , or your car through Uber , or your spare bedroom through AirBnB to add up to a middle-class income.ÂIn the end , this transition weâre going through could prove more exciting than people think , but right now asking large numbers of people to go from being an âemployeeâ to a âwork entrepreneurâ feels scary and uncertain . Having a national health care safety net under the vast majority of Americans â to ease and enable people to make this transition â is both morally right and in the interest of everyone who wants a stable society .
ATLANTA — Georgia Senate candidate Michelle Nunn is refusing to say whether she would have voted for President Barack Obama 's signature health care law in a race that could help determine congressional control .In a recent NBC News interview , Nunn said , `` it 's impossible to look back retrospectively and say , 'What would you have done if you were there ? ' ''Nunn has been critical of some aspects of the law , and praised other elements . She said `` Obamacare '' should not be repealed . A recent poll found most Georgians think the law needs major changes or should be repealed .Republicans must gain six seats to win the majority and have tried to make the midterm elections a referendum on `` Obamacare . ''Nunn is poised to capture the Democratic nomination for the open seat on Tuesday .
ATLANTA — In the South , where a Republican sweep of Senate races would all but guarantee a GOP takeover of the chamber , Democrats are pinning their hopes on two coastal states whose economic and population growth have often outpaced their neighbors ' .North Carolina remains the Democrats ' best bet for holding a hard-fought seat . And they see a long-shot chance to win Georgia 's GOP-held seat growing slightly brighter .But the Democrats ' prospects seem grimmer in other Southern states .They have virtually given up on ousting five-term Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell in Kentucky . And in Louisiana and Arkansas , veteran Democratic senators are struggling against challengers who relentlessly link them to an unpopular president , Barack Obama .With Election Day less than three weeks away , all these races are being stirred by debates , spending shifts and visits by famous politicians .In North Carolina , where Republicans are pouring millions of new dollars into trying to oust Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan , she spent Wednesday hitting GOP challenger Thom Tillis on women 's health issues .In Kentucky , Hillary Rodham Clinton 's visit the same day came at an awkward moment . The Democrats ' top Senate campaign group signaled Tuesday it would buy no more ads for Alison Lundergan Grimes ' bid to defeat McConnell .The most obvious difference in these races is the level of voter antagonism toward Obama . He lost North Carolina by only 2 percentage points in 2012 ( after winning it in 2008 ) , and he lost Georgia by 7 points .But Obama lost Arkansas , Louisiana and Kentucky by far greater margins . Republicans in these states want to drive out the last of their statewide elected Democrats , much as Alabama and Mississippi did several years ago .The South 's political realignment — from conservative Democratic stronghold in the 1960s to `` sunbelt '' Republican ascendancy in the 1980s and 1990s — continues to evolve . Job growth in and around Atlanta and Charlotte and Raleigh-Durham , North Carolina , is helping Democrats compete in those regions , even as rural areas turn strongly against them .`` The East Coast South is diversifying economically and demographically much more than the inner South , '' said Ferrel Guillory , who tracks regional politics and trends from the University of North Carolina . Economically robust areas of Virginia , North Carolina and Georgia have seen a greater influx of jobs , Northerners and Midwesterners than have their Deep South neighbors to the west , he said .Similar migration helped build Republican suburbs in the 1980s , Guillory said , but `` now the growth is helping fuel Democrats , '' especially as significant numbers of blacks return to these states .This year 's Senate races in Kentucky and Georgia illustrate the trend . A year ago , Democrats held roughly equal hopes that one of the states would produce a net Senate gain . McConnell has never been deeply popular in Kentucky , they noted , and Georgia 's seat was open thanks to GOP Sen. Saxby Chambliss ' retirement .But McConnell and his allies spent millions of dollars denouncing Grimes and Obama , and Grimes faltered recently when she repeatedly refused to say whether she had voted for the president .In Georgia , both parties turned to non-Washington candidates . Democrats chose Michelle Nunn , daughter of former Sen. Sam Nunn , while business executive David Perdue survived a crowded Republican primary .Georgia still tilts Republican , but Democrats are pounding Perdue for sending jobs overseas while heading large companies . They hope a libertarian candidate might force a Nunn-Perdue runoff in January , which would allow the attacks to continue .Developments in key races:LOUISIANA and ARKANSASRepublicans used televised debates to tie Democratic Sens . Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Mark Pryor of Arkansas as tightly to Obama as possible .Arkansas Republican Rep. Tom Cotton used the term `` Obama '' or `` Obamacare '' nine times in his two-minute opening statement , 13 times in his two-minute closing , and nearly 50 times in between during a debate Monday .`` Clearly , Congressman Cotton is running against one man , '' Pryor said . `` But I am running for 3 million Arkansans . ''Cassidy used the same anti-Obama tactic in a debate with Landrieu .NORTH CAROLINADemocrats note that requests for mail-in absentee ballots seem to favor them thus far , a possible sign of pro-Hagan enthusiasm . Republicans call the statistics insignificant , and say their targeted mail efforts will offset any Democratic edge .In a state already saturated with political TV ads , the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is launching a new round , featuring Sen.

Aaron Carroll talks about the Republican health care dilemma , and makes a good point : it runs deeper than the specific fact that Obamacare looks the way it does because it has to . At the most fundamental level , you can’t guarantee adequate health care to everyone unless the people who don’t need help right now — the young , healthy , and affluent — are induced , one way or another , to contribute to the care of those who do need help . You can do this purely with taxes , via a single-payer system ( and maybe even by having the government act as provider ) , or you can do it , Swiss or Massachusetts style , via a combination of regulation , taxes , and subsidies . But some way of corralling the lucky healthy into contributing is necessary .For the vast majority of this group , this is still a good deal — as Ezra Klein says , nobody stays young and healthy forever , and only a very small number of people are so rich that they are better off on a lifetime basis with no guarantee of insurance at all . But conservatives balk at the notion of any kind of redistribution , even if it makes almost everyone better off . So they are unable to come up with an alternative .What they have are fantasies — claims that somehow unleashing the magic of the marketplace can make health care so cheap that everyone can afford it . There is absolutely no reason to believe that this is true .And this also means that their only chance of defeating Obamacare was to stop it before it went into effect . Once it’s in place , most people will see real benefits — and Republicans will have nothing to offer instead .

After two years , “ObamaCare” is an epithet no more . The Obama campaign says so .On Friday , the second anniversary of the day President Obama signed the law expanding health insurance — and two days before the Supreme Court opens arguments on its constitutionality — his re-election campaign has embraced the term that Republicans have long used to deride the measure .The law is the president’s signature domestic achievement , but still a widely unpopular one — thanks in part to the sustained Republican assault that Democrats never countered in kind — at least until now .Jim Messina , the Obama campaign manager , wrote in a fundraising e-mail : “It’s about time we give it the love it deserves . Let everyone know : ‘I like ObamaCare’.”With such prodding , supporters wrote endorsements on Facebook and on their Twitter accounts , making “ # ILikeObamaCare” a trending topic on Twitter .Jennifer O’Malley Dillon , the deputy campaign manager , sent out her own tweets and re-tweeted others , including this one : “Happy birthday to ObamaCare : two years in , the Affordable Care Act is making millions of Americans’ lives better every day.”In the past , Mr. Obama , at occasional party fund-raisers , has said he does not mind that Republicans have called the law “ObamaCare , ” saying they are right : “Obama cares.” But while the White House and his campaign had never done much to push back against use of the word — perhaps hoping for the day that they would want to own it — they had not until now taken ownership .The move to do so on Friday countered Republicans’ own campaign on the law’s second anniversary , taunting the White House for not doing anything special to observe the day .“Today is the 2nd anniversary of ObamaCare , a milestone the president is not celebrating . Why ? He doesn’t want to defend it , ” Sean Spicer , the communications director of the Republican National Committee , wrote in an e-mail he circulated widely .
After yesterday’s detour into electoral politics , let’s turn back to the health care debate . Last week , amid the ongoing coverage of rising premiums and cancelled plans , the health care law’s defenders took a new tack , arguing that the most plausible conservative alternatives to Obamacare would involve even more disruption of existing arrangements — with the implication being , then , that Republican outrage over “rate shock “is either straightforwardly cynical or else a sign that the G.O.P . would never , ever be willing to embrace a reform that disrupts the status quo at all .This argument has some merit , for the reasons Philip Klein elaborated on here : You can’t have health care reform without some kind of insurance disruption , and a Republican would-be reformer who made an Obama-esque “keep your plan” promise would either be exposed as a liar with similar alacrity or end up never actually undertaking reform at all . ( This is yet another reason why a total death-spiraling exchange failure , coupled with a relative successful Medicaid rollout , would not necessarily leave conservative reformers in an ideal political spot . )But I also think it’s useful to think about the differences between the kind of disruption that would accompany the most plausible conservative alternative to Obamacare and what we’re actually witnessing today , because it helps clarify whether the Affordable Care Act actually represents what Jonathan Chait , speaking for the defense , calls “the least-disruptive , least-painful way” to expand insurance coverage .The conservative alternative I have in mind is not what you might call “the full McCain” — the conversion of the existing employer tax exclusion for health insurance into a universal credit , which is an elegant idea in conception but which would indeed disrupt existing arrangements more dramatically than the Affordable Care Act , and which ( on the evidence of the 2008 campaign ) is about as politically sale-able as single payer . Rather , it’s the more modest plan the American Enterprise Institute’s James Capretta has done the most work fleshing out , in which a cap on the employer deduction helps pay for a flat credit available only to those Americans who don’t receive coverage through their workplace .Liberals object to this plan for a variety of reasons : The credit would fund catastrophic coverage rather than the comprehensive insurance they prefer , and it would require expanding high-risk pools to cover current uninsurables rather than folding them into the existing insurance system . But on the specific question of existing-plan disruption — who bears the burden of reform , and why — I think the Capretta plan has advantages over Obamacare that even liberals should be able to recognize .That’s because the way our system is set up right now , anyone who buys insurance on the individual market has been persistently disadvantaged , and often dramatically so , relative to anyone who gets insurance through their employer , because employer-provided insurance comes with an effective government subsidy ( “worth more than $ 5,000 on a $ 13,000 employer-sponsored plan” for an upper middle class family , Capretta points out ) while the individual marketplace does not . So a cap on the employer tax exclusion , while disruptive , would make the system fairer in clear , uncomplicated ways : It would curb a tax subsidy that mostly benefits people with higher incomes and only benefits people with expensive insurance plans , and extend that subsidy to people who have had to pay more , often much more , for insurance up until now .By contrast , the Obamacare approach loads much more of the financial burden of reform on to the individual market , creating a stark , even chasm-like divide between that market’s winners and losers and leaving the latter doubly-shafted : They still don’t get a tax subsidy and their plans are getting a lot more expensive into the bargain .Some of these losers are well-off , yes . But many of them are middle class , and not necessarily better off than the people who would lose out under an employer-exclusion cap . Moreover , there’s a significant difference between what such a cap would actually do to people with employer-provided insurance and what Obamacare does to people with less-expensive individual market plans . The cap would basically give employers and employees a choice : Keep the expensive plans you currently have with higher premiums and co-pays attached ( or with a higher tax bill at the end of the year ) , or shift down to plans with higher deductibles , network limitations , and so forth . This is not an easy choice by any means , and it would undoubtedly lead to the equivalent of some of the unhappy stories associated with Obamacare’s regulations — people who feel like they can no longer afford coverage they like , people who end up losing access to their doctors and hospitals because their employer stops offering a plan , and so on . But I would submit that it’s actually more humane to expose the already-subsidized to more of the real costs associated with their expensive insurance than it is to tell the persistently-unsubsidized that their most affordable insurance options are being outlawed , and that they are now required by law to pay more for more coverage ( or , as often seems to be the case , to pay more for less ) .What’s more , as Reihan Salam points out in an exchange with Salon’s Brian Beutler , this isn’t an either-or choice , because Obamacare too includes a kludge-y version of the employer tax deduction cap in the form of the excise ( or “Cadillac” ) tax on high-cost insurance plans : It’s just set a higher threshold and thus applies to fewer policies than would the conservative alternative . That tax isn’t scheduled to be implemented till 2018 ( or year two of the Christie administration , if you prefer ) , so its effects aren’t being fully felt as yet — but as the date gets closer , that provision will lead to rate increases and policy changes at the more expensive end of the employer market as well . So in comparing the potential disruptive effect of Capretta’s cap-and-credit approach to the Affordable Care Act , you have to look at the complete picture : What we’re seeing from Obamacare right now is only the beginning of the disruptions to existing plans , and today’s individual market losers are only the first wave of people to whom the president’s “keep your plan” promise doesn’t actually apply .The choice , then , isn’t between gouging a few million people in the individual market or gouging a much larger number in the employer-based market . It’s between a reform ( the conservative alternative ) that concentrates its disruptive impact the heretofore-oversubsidized portion of the marketplace , while trying to make the individual market more affordable for everyone who buys there , or a reform ( Obamacare ) that’s disruptive for some people in the employer market but continues to protect most of them from the true price of their insurance , while pushing more of the off-budget cost of reform on to individual market premiums .There are enough moving parts and unknown unknowns in each alternative that it’s hard to say for sure which would one would ultimately be more disruptive in absolute terms ( or even to define what those “absolute terms” would be ) . But I think there are various metrics — simplicity , equity , the choices left available and the incentives created — on which the conservative option might come out ahead .
Amid this week’s hints that the federal exchange still won’t be anywhere close to functional on December 1st , Matt Yglesias offers the latest noble attempt to explain to Americans losing their individual-market coverage why they’re actually better off paying higher premiums for new , Obamacare-era plans . Instead of focusing on the more comprehensive benefits that the new plans offer , he takes a different tack — suggesting that most people with cheapish individual-market coverage didn’t really have insurance at all:… The ACA cracks down on insurance rescission . It was famously difficult on the old market for people with “pre-existing conditions” to get coverage . That’s because insurance companies don’t want to cover people who are actually sick . Even healthy people generally want health insurance coverage because they might get sick . But an insurance company has no desire to actually foot the bill for a seriously ill person’s medical treatment . Hence , in the individual market the standard practice was to earn a profit selling peace of mind to healthy people , only to pivot as quickly as possible toward cancellation of the plan as soon as major bills started coming in . The ACA , rightly , puts a stop to this scam .Since insurance companies now won’t be allowed to collect premiums while you’re healthy only to yank coverage when you get sick , they have no choice but to pre-emptively cancel plans that wouldn’t be financially beneficial to actually pay out .That’s the story of Obamacare “victims” such as Lee Hammack and JoEllen Brothers , loyal Democrats aged 60 and 59 who enjoyed miraculously low premiums until the ACA ruined the party . Hammack and Brothers are certainly entitled to feel miffed about losing their apparently sweet deal . But they ought to reflect on the overwhelming likelihood that their pre-ACA circumstances were a happy illusion . They were both , by their own admission , quite healthy and thus profitable to insure . Had one of them actually fallen ill , the plan would have become a loss center for the insurer and canceled as swiftly as a pretext could be found . It’s being canceled now because under the new rules it’s now or never for the insurer . Charging premiums only to yank the policy retroactively is no longer on the table .While “rescission” is a real phenomenon in the individual market , and ( for obvious reasons ) a controversial , lawsuit-generating one , I don’t see Yglesias citing any evidence to back up his claim that it was anything like “the standard practice” for insurers pre-Obamacare , or that most people’s coverage was therefore “illusory” and subject to all-but-inevitable retroactive cancellation . And those contention seem dubious at best . During the original Obamacare debate , for instance , the conservative economist John Goodman cited data suggesting that rescission is actually vanishingly rare , and noted that the White House accused insurers of “systematically” rescinding coverage for women with breast cancer based on just four cases out of thousands . Likewise , the University of Pennsylvania’s Mark Pauly has done a fair amount of research on individual insurance market outcomes , concluding that “although there have been some anecdotes about insurers slipping out of their policy provision to renew coverage at group average premiums for high risks by canceling the coverage entirely , we conclude that on average guaranteed renewability works in practice as it should in theory and provides a substantial amount of protection against high premiums to those high risk individuals who bought insurance before their risk levels changed.” ( In this paper from 2008 , he and a co-author found that while the employer coverage was more stable than individual-market coverage for Americans with average health , “for people in fair or poor health” the chances of losing coverage are actually lower in the individual market than in the employer-based market . )Maybe these analyses are mistaken , and there are detailed dives into the data that confirm Yglesias’s argument . But it seems like Goodman’s 2010 point is well taken : If rescission were the rule rather than a rare exception , it’s hard to imagine that much of an individual market would actually exist , let alone serve millions of consumers . You don’t need to have faith in the kindness of insurers ( I certainly don’t ) to recognize that in the aggregate , companies that don’t deliver what their products promise ( and what the law and state regulators require of them ) tend to run into problems pretty quickly . And so the exceptions notwithstanding , it seems quite likely that the plan Lee Hammack and JoEllen Brothers paid for — and many other pre-Obamacare plans like them — would have actually paid out .
Among the many vituperative reactions I had to yesterday’s column , one recurred a lot — namely , the assertion that California’s rising enrollment in Obamacare would bankrupt the state , which is already a fiscal basket case .Guys , you do need to keep up a bit .First of all , the Obamacare subsidies — both the credits for insurance purchased on the exchanges and the Medicaid expansion — are paid for by the federal government . In fact , implementing Obamacare is a major fiscal and economic boost to any state that does it , and states opting out of the Medicaid expansion are going to have significantly lower overall incomes and fewer jobs than if they had gone along . ( My back of the envelope says around 1 percent of GDP , but I’m still working on that . )Beyond that , however , the California as fiscal basket case narrative is way , way out of date . Jerry Brown and the huge Democratic majority in the legislature have turned that situation completely around .I know , it’s not supposed to be that way — and a lot of people will stick to their narrative , never mind the facts . But anyway , California is doing OK , both on health care and on budget policy .
An editor with multiple graduate degrees once called me up with a story idea hatched among fellow trend-sniffers in Manhattan . “Indians , ” he said , with practiced urgency . “Something’s going on with American Indians . Look into it and tell me what you think.”Dutifully , I reported back that the first Americans were still poor , still forgotten , still there — albeit with casinos and better lobbyists in Washington . The forgotten part applies especially at elections , given that natives who list themselves as “Indian alone” on the census form make up less than 1 percent of the total population of the United States .But — news alert ! — with barely two weeks to go until the midterm federal election , the most underrepresented people in the country could be the kingmakers for control of the Senate . Let us pause for the cynical voice of an Indian friend who thinks that elections don’t matter : “Democrats , Republicans , they’re all white to me , ” he says .Still , the fact that all the money and manipulations of the Koch brothers could be undone by a handful of native voters living in some of the poorest and most remote parts of the land is a tribute to our teetering democracy . More time has been wasted defending the name of the Washington Professional Football Team than has ever been spent discussing tribal sovereignty or how the modern diet is killing too many natives . Yet now , important-sounding people have been forced to learn a phrase in Yup’ik , or find Shannon County , S.D. , on a map .The Senate , by design , is unrepresentative . Why should Wyoming have as many senators as California , which has more than 60 times the population ? That design also means that people in crowded states occasionally have to feign concern for residents in wide-open spaces .Thus we find ourselves in Alaska and South Dakota , where the native vote could be the only thing that stands in the way of a Republican-controlled Senate . Alaska voters , though quirky and contrarian no matter what the race , seem poised to give the Republican Dan Sullivan the seat now held by the Democrat Mark Begich . Except typically , the polls are more misleading in the Last Frontier than a fish finder’s sonar in a bathtub .Only about 250,000 people are expected to vote there . Of those , almost one in five has some Alaska Native or Indian blood — the highest percentage of any state . Begich has been feverishly working native villages in advance of the state’s two weeks of early voting . If the race is a nail-biter , look for late returns from , say , Kotzebue , an Inupiat town on a gravel spit 33 miles north of the Arctic Circle , to decide the winner .In South Dakota , Native Americans are the largest single minority group , and they tend to vote Democratic . In a three-way race , heavy turnout on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation might be enough to prevent the fading Republican front-runner , Mike Rounds , from picking up the seat . Tribal elections are the same day , as is a ballot measure to change the name of Shannon County , which is more than 90 percent Indian , to Oglala Lakota County . In 2012 , the tribes of North Dakota provided the winning margin for the Democrat Heidi Heitkamp , who won her Senate seat by just over 4,000 votes .“The candidate who learns best how to ask Indians for their votes could be the winner , ” Indian Country Today , the national tribal paper , reported this week in a story on South Dakota .What no vote can change are the woeful conditions in many parts of Indian country . Suicide , substance abuse and chronic unemployment are the scourges of many tribal homelands . Half the people in Shannon County live below the poverty level .Depressing , yes . So what we talk about when we talk about Indians seldom gets beyond caricature . On the left , measures like Seattle’s new designation of the second Monday in October as Indigenous Peoples’ Day is the kind of empty , feel-good measure that sets up a comically liberal city council for mockery . It’s not a real holiday , just enough of one to insult Italian-Americans who feel slighted at the dis of Christopher Columbus .On the right , there is a hysterical fear of granting Indians any real power . So the Violence Against Women Act almost didn’t make it through renewal last year because Republicans didn’t want to allow tribes to prosecute non-Indians who assaulted Indians in Indian country .Obamacare is a pundit’s punching bag in much of the country . But on reservations , it has made a life-or-death difference for thousands of people whose health has been improved by some of the law’s lesser-known provisions .At the center of most questions in the native world is a construct that Americans often forget or ignore : nations within a nation . Tribes point to their treaties that grant a degree of sovereignty , signed by long-dead presidents , backed by Supreme Court decisions . If they can get a politician to understand that at election time , it’s a minor victory .
And got a great deal .Oh , and enrollment is surging on the state exchanges .
Andrew Leonard has a good point : if Obamacare is such a disaster for the economy , where’s the market reaction ?More broadly : the perceived probability of passage , as indicated by Intrade , was only around 30 percent a month ago ( which is why I’m still rubbing my eyes ) . So the expectations of what we’re told would be a great disaster have risen dramatically . And the market has yawned .
Another day , another Romney whopper . Now he says that he’ll keep the good parts of Obamacare , in particular coverage for people with pre-existing conditions , while scrapping the rest .You can’t do that – and Romney knows very well that you can’t do that , because the logic that went into Romneycare in Massachusetts is the same as the logic behind Obamacare .Suppose you want to guarantee that insurance is available to people with pre-existing conditions . Well , you can establish community rating , requiring that insurance companies make the same policies available to everyone . But if you stop there , you know what will happen : healthy people will opt out , leaving behind a high-risk , high-cost pool .So you have to also have a mandate , requiring that people buy insurance . And you can’t do that without subsidies , so that lower-income people can afford their policies .The inexorable logic of the situation , then , leads to a three-legged stool of community rating + mandate + subsidies = ObamaRomneycare .So , does Romney think we’re stupid ? Hey , he also thinks we’ll buy into his promises to slash taxes by $ 5 trillion but make up the revenue by closing unspecified loopholes in a way that doesn’t raise taxes on the middle class – which turns out to be arithmetically impossible . So the answer is , yes , he thinks we’re stupid .
Another die-hard opponent of the Affordable Care Act may be finding a way to expand Medicaid . Few have stood as firm against Obamacare as Gov . Mike Pence of Indiana , but on Thursday he announced a new proposal that would accept federal funds for increased coverage of low-income state residents — though by giving them access to private insurance plans rather than standard Medicaid .Mr. Pence now joins conservative leaders of Arkansas , Michigan , Pennsylvania and Utah who have recently found or are trying to find ways to “get to yes” with the federal government on this issue . If Mr. Pence can find a way , it’s likely some of the 23 holdout states will eventually follow .This is significant , because since the Supreme Court made the Medicaid expansion optional for states in 2012 , many states have refused to expand the program . This has left about 5 million people nationwide in a coverage gap , where they are too poor to qualify for exchange subsidies to purchase private insurance , and ineligible for Medicaid as it currently exists . Expanding Medicaid in some way is really the only option for their getting insured , and this proposal gets them much closer to that place .Mr. Pence proposed an expansion of the Healthy Indiana Plan ( HIP ) , a Medicaid alternative that was created in 2007 by a waiver from the Bush administration . It provided coverage to adults in Indiana who earned less than 200 percent of the poverty line . This was important , as parents are eligible for Medicaid only if they earn less than 24 percent of the federal poverty line , or about $ 5,700 for a family of four . Adults without children are not eligible for Medicaid at all .HIP was novel in its reliance on health savings accounts . All participants had to contribute between 2 percent and 5 percent of their income to a special account each month , and the state then topped it up to $ 1,100 each year . This money was used to pay for most nonpreventive health care ; most preventive care was free . If participants exhausted their account , they would be covered by a private health insurance plan .Mr. Pence has long wanted to use HIP as a vehicle to expand coverage for the poor of his state . The federal government has so far refused because it doesn’t meet the standard requirements for Medicaid . It has both annual and lifetime limits , meaning that coverage can run out over time . It has no maternity benefits , either , let alone the many preventive care benefits the Affordable Care Act mandates . And , it requires people to put money in the health savings accounts or risk losing coverage .But without an expansion , many in Indiana would be left uninsured this year . More than 800,000 in the state were uninsured before the ACA was rolled out . About 375,000 of them would probably newly qualify for this program .Governor Pence’s proposal , HIP 2.0 , compromises by creating three options . The first , HIP Link , would provide premium assistance to low-income people who have access to employer-based insurance but can not afford it . Option two , HIP Basic , will be more like HIP , but be available with no contribution to premiums to those earning below the poverty line . HIP Plus will include dental and vision coverage , and it will require monthly contributions between $ 3 and $ 25 , depending on income , to a health savings account .Indiana now needs to allow a period of public hearings in the state . It also needs to get buy-in from local legislators for the plan . But federal approval seems likely . A spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services , Emma Sandoe , said in a statement , “We are encouraged by Indiana and Governor Pence’s commitment to helping cover more of the state’s uninsured population through the Healthy Indiana program and look forward to seeing his proposal.”And the department has already approved plans like Michigan’s , which is not too different from this one . It also requires beneficiaries who earn between 100 percent and 133 percent of the poverty line to pay 2 percent of their income to a health savings account and limits cost-sharing to no more than 5 percent of income .Mr. Pence hopes to submit his proposal by the end of June . If approved , many uninsured people in Indiana would see their prospects improve if they became eligible for insurance . Hospitals and providers would probably see their numbers of Medicaid covered patients go up and uninsured patients go down . Indiana’s state government would get to hold true to its belief that private insurance and health savings accounts are the best way to expand coverage . Finally , the Obama administration would get to achieve its goal of fully activating the ACA in another state .The one caveat here is that it’s possible that expansion of insurance through HIP could be more expensive than expansion through traditional Medicaid , perhaps more than 40 percent more , according to past reports from the state’s own actuary . It’s unclear whether that’s still the case . Either way , it seems that all involved may be willing to pay that price to move forward .
Anthony D. Weinerâs advocacy for Obamacare was well known to anyone watching cable news when the House of Representatives passed the legislation in 2009 . But did he really coin the term ?He said so in an interview with The New York Times recently , which quoted him saying it , near the bottom of a front-page article on Thursday about Mr. Weinerâs record in Congress .Published , the claim prompted a round of invented-the-Internet-style mockery at Mr. Weinerâs expense on Thursday . After all , the term Obamacare had circulated for some time â Mitt Romney used it in a presidential debate as early as 2007 â and Mr. Weiner did not become outspoken on the issue , let alone embrace the term , until much later .âWell , no one said you get elected mayor on modesty , â Edward-Isaac Dovere of Politico wrote on Twitter . Emalie Clamage , a blogger , joked that Mr. Weinerâs father was âthe inventor of Toaster Strudel.âBut Barbara Morgan , a spokeswoman for Mr. Weiner , who is running for mayor of New York City , insisted on Thursday that he did not mean that he was the first person ever to use the term â only the first on the left to embrace it unapologetically .âUp till then , the right had used the term as a pejorative , â she said . âHe realized that running from the term was a mistake , and eventually so did the White House and the Obama campaign.âIn the interview with The Times , which was recorded , Mr. Weiner was defending his work on behalf of the health legislation when he brought up the term Obamacare .He added , in an aside , that it was âa term , by the way , that I coined and used proudly , long before the administration decided it was a good idea . And I got yelled at by the White House for using it , and then they eventually reached the place where they used it.â
Are you one of the 46 million Americans without health insurance ? Well , you may not have that , uh , luxury for much longer . “A federal judge in Michigan on Thursday dismissed one of more than 15 legal challenges to the new health care law , becoming the first to rule that the law is constitutional , ” reports The Times’s Kevin Sack . “The central question , which may ultimately fall to the Supreme Court , is whether the Commerce Clause of the Constitution gives Congress the authority to require citizens to obtain a commercial product , namely health insurance . Starting in 2014 , the law will require most Americans to obtain health insurance …”Judge George Steeh’s ruling centers on the idea that health care is distinct from other “products” in such a way that the act of not purchasing it constitutes involvement in interstate commerce . ( I’ve tried to make a similar argument to my wife about N.F.L . Sunday Ticket , but she’s apparently from the strict constructionist school . ) Here’s key section of the decision:The health care market is unlike other markets . No one can guarantee his or her health , or ensure that he or she will never participate in the health care market . Indeed , the opposite is nearly always true . The question is how participants in the health care market pay for medical expenses – through insurance , or through an attempt to pay out of pocket with a backstop of uncompensated care funded by third parties . This phenomenon of costshifting is what makes the health care market unique . Far from “inactivity , ” by choosing to forgo insurance plaintiffs are making an economic decision to try to pay for health care services later , out of pocket , rather than now through the purchase of insurance , collectively shifting billions of dollars , $ 43 billion in 2008 , onto other market participants .“The future of health care reform just became a little more secure , ” writes a thankful Jonathan Cohn at The New Republic:The premise of Steeh’s legal argument seems to be a notion about policy–that it’s not possible to regulate the insurance industry , in a way that would make coverage available to all people , without compelling every person to get coverage . On that count , I would argue , Steeh is correct .So what does this mean for the repeal movement ? My limited understanding , informed by a few casual conversations with some law professors , is that Steeh’s decision is consistent with the traditional understanding of the Commerce Clause–that the only way to throw out the mandate would be to reexamine conventional assumptions about the Commerce Clause . That would be a fairly radical move . But Steeh is a Clinton appointee . As those other suits go forward in other states , culminating perhaps in a Supreme Court case , we’re going to hear from some judges who are more conservative–in some cases , a lot more conservative . Radical reinterpretation of the Commerce Clause may be something they’re willing to try .Allahpundit at Hot Air thinks the judge was following precedent from on high : “This really is well in line with the Supreme Court’s ridiculously expansive Commerce Clause jurisprudence . You can’t opt out of interstate marijuana commerce by growing and using your own at home , so why should you be able to opt out of interstate health insurance commerce when you’re bound to use medical facilities somewhere at some point ? ”Still , Allahpundit thinks the judge has covered some new , and shaky , ground:What he’s saying here , basically , is that we’re all either already or potentially engaged in health-care commerce because none of us will fail to seek essential medical services if they’re required and none of us will be denied essential services if we can’t pay . The supermarket will turn away a starving man if he has no money ; not so the ER and people who are sick , so for all intents and purposes , we’ve all already opted in here . That being so , the feds can regulate how those services are paid for …If we’re all necessarily “active” in health-care commerce at all times , theoretically there’s no limit to what sort of further activity can be mandated in the interest of spreading costs . Can the overweight man or woman be forced to diet because he/she is more likely to need medical services ? Presumably that would be dealt with via higher insurance premiums , but we all know only too well already that federal pressure on insurers to keep premiums down will create all sorts of inefficiencies , which is where we get into ye olde rationing problem . Simple question : What’s the limiting principle on this decision ? Would the feds be barred from penalizing people for failing to maintain , say , a certain BMI target because of the right of privacy or bodily autonomy , etc ? Or would they not be barred at all ? Where does this end ?“I actually wish the purchase of health insurance was interstate commerce , ” adds New Jersey blogger Chris Wysocki . “True interstate commerce , as in I can buy health insurance from a company that is in another state . Like New York , where the RPI alumni association offers a Blue Cross plan which is 35 % cheaper than the … Aetna plan I’m forced to buy here in New Jersey . Oh sure , Blue Cross has a ‘New Jersey’ plan , it’s even more expensive than Aetna . But right over the border there’s that tantalizing ‘New York’ plan , taunting me with its lower premiums and better benefits . True ‘interstate commerce”‘ would mean that I could buy it.”Ilya Somin at the Volokh Conspiracy thinks that Judge Steeh has a skewed view of how the health market works:The problem with this reasoning is that those who choose not to buy health insurance aren’t necessarily therefore going to buy the same services in other ways later . Some will , but some won’t . It depends on whether or not they get sick , how severe ( and how treatable their illnesses are ) , whether if they do get sick , they can get assistance from charity , and many other factors . In addition , some people might be able to maintain their health simply by buying services that aren’t usually covered by insurance anyway , such as numerous low-cost medicines available in drug stores and the like . In such cases , they aren’t really participating in the same market as insurance purchasers .Jay Stevens at Left in the West isn’t buying Somin’s point . “For starters , unless non-insurance-buyers are some kind of genetic Supermenschen , they , as a group , will experience sudden and catastrophic injury or illness at the same rate that insurance buyers do — at best , ” he writes . “Of course , that’s only considering the statistical case . In reality , the uninsured are much more likely to rack up higher long-term medical costs because they are much less likely to seek out preventative or early medical care . But , more simply , everyone gets sick and dies eventually . No one ‘maintains their health.’ Healthcare is inevitable for all … So , under the commerce clause of the Constitution and Congress’ power ‘to tax and spend providing for the general welfare , ’ the bill is legal.”Another careful reader of Somin’s post was Randy Barnett , also at the Volokh blog : “I agree with [ Somin 's ] assessment of the opinion , with one exception . I do not believe Judge Steeh relied upon existing Supreme Court doctrine because of his claim that this was a case ‘of first impression’ and therefore not covered by that doctrine . This presents a new debate : Has the Supreme Court covered the field with its current Commerce and Necessary & Proper Clause analysis , in which case lower courts are bound to hold the Act is unconstitutional because it extends beyond this doctrine ? Or does the unprecedented nature of the individual mandate render this a case ‘of first impression’ requiring new doctrine that lower courts are free to invent ? ”That argument may be a bit heady for us lay readers , but Barnett’s more general comments are crystal clear , if somewhat dystopian:Never before in American history has the U.S. Government imposed an economic mandate commanding that persons engage in economic activity … Judge Steeh accepted the government’s expansion of Congressional power beyond regulating economic activity to regulating economic “decisions” … By inventing a new “economic decisions” doctrine , Judge Steeh has gone beyond the Commerce and Necessary and Proper Clause doctrines established by the Supreme Court . Only the Supreme Court is authorized to expand its own interpretation of the scope of Congressional power .Of course , judges in other challenges will have their opportunity to opine on whether Congress has the power to regulate any “economic decision” that may substantially affect interstate commerce . The “economic decision” not to buy a car , the “economic decision” not to buy or sell your home , or even the “economic decision” not to have a physical exam . For make no mistake . If the Supreme Court ever accepts the government’s “economic decision” theory , then there is nothing it can not mandate in the future in the name of regulating “commerce . . . among the several states.” Congress will then have the general police power that both the Constitution and the Supreme Court has always denied it .Same blog , yet another view : “Randy states that Judge Steeh claimed that this was a case of first impression and therefore not covered by Supreme Court doctrine , ” argues Orin Kerr at Volokh . “But I don’t think that’s what Judge Steeh said …Judge Steeh’s opinion seems to me to be relying on existing Supreme Court doctrine . Now , of course you could argue that it’s relying incorrectly on that precedent . But it seems to me that the opinion on its terms is applying Supreme Court precedent , not inventing a new doctrine.”In any case , Kerr thinks that , legally , this is all moot:In my view , what district courts do with the individual mandate is essentially irrelevant for all but political purposes . The issue in this case is legal , not factual , and an appeal is guaranteed . This means all of the district court decisions are just for show , and the real issue is whether any circuit court panels will get a majority to vote against the mandate , survive en banc challenge , and therefore create a split that prompts Supreme Court review . I personally doubt they will , and I would guess that the Supreme Court won’t review the issue without a split . If the Supreme Court does take the case it seems like a likely 8–1 to me , with Justice Thomas dissenting …On the political side , incidentally , I think it’s quite different . In the political realm , district court decisions on the mandate are hugely important . A district court decision striking down the mandate would give added fuel to GOP efforts to repeal the mandate after the mid-term election if Republicans take over the House and ( maybe ) Senate . All the more true if the opinion includes lots of majestic prose about overreaching government .Repeal ? Washington Monthly’s Steve Benen isn’t worried:No matter what happens in the midterm elections , opponents of the Affordable Care Act will struggle to repeal the law through legislative means . They’re better off , at least marginally , taking their case to the courts , where there are currently over a dozen challenges to various provisions of the health care law , most notably the individual mandate … There are , however , plenty of rulings yet to come , and yesterday’s decision will be appealed to the 6th Circuit , which is one of the nation’s most conservative and might be inclined to make a “fairly radical move.” Still , yesterday was a heartening win , and will likely be the first of many .Tom Maguire at JustOneMinute thinks this goes well beyond health care , and gets to the center of President Obama’s hopes and dreams:The ER is legally proscribed from turning people away , which reflects the values of our society . However , that sense of compassion has apparently morphed into compulsion – since we won’t let people bleed out on the steps of the hospital , a judge has concluded that we can require them to buy insurance . That is an interesting shift in favor of Obama’s view of himself as his brother’s keeper , with the constitutional right to impose his keeper-dom whether his brother wants it or not . My sense of individual freedom and responsibility has now been trumped by Obama’s determination to help me whether I want his help or not . I can see the new license plates already – Live Free My Way Or Die .Maguire gets support , of a sort , from Scott Lemieux of Lawyers , Guns and Money : “Part of me wishes that Maguire’s position ( although I believe it is very wrong as a matter of constitutional law ) would prevail , because holding the mandate unconstitutional would ( given the other plainly constitutional and very popular provisions requiring that insurers not deny insurance based on pre-existing conditions ) destroy the private insurance markets , which would just lead to the state-run insurance that has proven in many other countries to provide better results for less money . Which , again , would be clearly constitutional unless you want to argue that Medicare , Social Security , etc . are also unconstitutional . So , hey , good luck libertarian litigators ! ”So there’s your contrarian thought for the day : if you kill Obamacare , you will only make it stronger .
As Greg Sargent has been pointing out for some time , the startup troubles of Obamacare have divided both the general public and the political class into two different intellectual universes . On one side , Republicans — both the base and the political leadership — have decided that health reform is already a failure ; that conviction is actually helping the leadership rein in some of the crazies , by telling them that now is the time to wait and let the political payoff from Obamacare’s collapse fall into their laps .On the other side , Democrats see a law that got off to a terrible start but is getting rapidly better .Which is right ? There’s data showing a sharp rise in enrollments , but there are continuing problems with the back end , and then there are dueling anecdotes . It would be hard to assess all this objectively even if political passions weren’t running so high .But one group has a strong incentive to be objective — and also has a much better perspective on what’s really going on than any lay observer . Namely , the insurance industry . So the shoe we’ve all been waiting to see drop — or not — was the surge of advertising urging people buying insurance through the exchanges to buy from me , me , me .That shoe has just dropped , with $ 500 million of advertising spending now in the pipeline . Insurers think this is going to work .Now , some people will see this as bad news . Obamacare is just going to add to insurer profits ! And it will indeed make money for the likes of Aetna and Wellpoint . In an ideal world , this wouldn’t be happening : single payer would clearly have been a better system . But it wasn’t going to happen . This was the health reform we could get — and when it works , as the big money now believes it will , it’s going to make a huge , positive difference to millions of lives .
As Republican control and racially polarized politics have grown in the American South during the Obama presidency , so has the willingness of many Southerners to speak frankly about racial divisions in their comments to the Times .The latest window opened on these voices of the South in response to Charles Blow’s Thursday column , “The Solid South Will Rise Again.”“The Democrats wrote off the region long ago , and working class whites knew it , ” Lars in Winder , Ga. , wrote . “Both whites and blacks in the South desperately need economic solutions to their problems ; so far I haven’t heard many.”In numerous states , Republicans control every congressional district with a white majority population , and the seats in the United States Senate as well , Mr. Blow wrote .“This region has become so solidly Republican , particularly since President Obama was elected , that there isn’t much left there for the Democratic Party to defend or salvage , ” Mr. Blow wrote .Midterm election results in Louisiana are stark illustration . Senator Mary Landrieu , a Louisiana Democrat who faces a runoff election in December , won just 18 percent support from white voters earlier this month , but 94 percent from black voters , Mr. Blow noted .That racial dichotomy points to the inseparable nature of ideology and race in the South , Mr. Blow said . And readers from the region agreed , throwing in a mascot to round out the picture .“A strange combination of conservative politics and Christian religion has become a regional white identity ( along with being fans of the LSU Tigers ) , ” wrote “a person” from Louisiana . “Republicans have managed to integrate their ideas into the very character of white Southerners.”Some readers explained they feel more alienated from Democrats than from Republicans , who also repel them .“As a white Southerner I can’t help but feel that the Democratic Party hates me and views my values with contempt , ” Jim C. wrote from Georgia . “We vote Republican because they are the lesser evil , not because we want to be exploited by that pack of ignorant reactionaries.”Republican campaigns playing on people’s fears stoke the disaffection , even as average voters suffer , some readers explained , using recent electioneering as example .“In campaigns for re-election the G.O.P . mentions Obama’s name , Obamacare , ISIL , Ebola and illegal immigration as if they are the root of all the problems we face , ” LVG wrote from Atlanta . “Yet Georgia has the highest unemployment in the country . These folks get re-elected despite their failure to govern.”Mr. Blow wrote , “This regional hyper-racialization of our politics has many origins , some historical and some current , but it does not bode well for the future of the country as a whole.”Some readers responded angrily , saying black voters’ strong affiliation with the Democratic Party and ethnic divisions in Northern cities are equivalent characteristics to the increasing Republican majority in the South .“Just because your values and party affiliation is one or the other doesn’t mean based on your choice of where you live means you are bigoted , ignorant or racists ! ” Macman007 wrote from Alabama . “Better try and find a new boogeyman.”Others said politics in the South will always have racial characteristics .“As long as Democrats are perceived to be the party of black Americans , they will not make inroads until the deep-seated antipathy of whites toward blacks here ceases , ” wrote Joseph in Phenix City , Ala. “I don’t have any hopes it will be soon.”The undeniable polarization is harmful to the country , Mr. Blow wrote . “We are self-sorting ourselves into hardened , impenetrable citadels of ideological sameness that harks back to the nation’s darker days , ” he wrote .Believing in a racially reconciled America is just progressive vanity , some Southerners said .“The midterm elections have left us with the America that always has been , ” Ken H. wrote from Athens , Ala. “It is tainted with more racial , gender , ethnic , and religious discrimination than we like to admit.”
As Republicans observe the second anniversary of President Obama’s signing of the health care law this week , a new motto is emerging that could hurt the law’s implementation : Repeal or nothing .Last week , an array of conservative leaders , including former Attorney General Edwin Meese III and the activists Gary Bauer , Tony Perkins and Richard Viguerie , wrote a letter to Republican lawmakers arguing against efforts to repeal an independent board empowered by the health care law to find ways to bring down Medicare costs .Not that the letter writers like the Independent Payment Advisory Board . They loathe it .“I.P.A.B . is an unelected and unaccountable board of 15 bureaucrats empowered to set Medicare reimbursement rates in order to control costs , and it will mean rationed health care for our nation’s senior citizens , ” they wrote .But , they said , going after politically objectionable elements of the law one by one will only make the parts of the law that survive more politically palatable . The bill to repeal the board , which the House is scheduled to consider this week , “is part of a troubling trend to break off the worst portions of ‘Obamacare’ for individual votes , which muddies the water in this election year between those who are adamantly opposed to ‘Obamacare’ and those who want to see its implementation , ” the conservatives wrote . “This approach is misguided at this point in our nation’s national dialogue.”This position is presenting a problem for the health care industry . Major legislation like the Affordable Care Act is routinely revised as it is implemented . But obvious flaws can not be remedied by Congress because conservatives oppose any legislation at all that might ease implementation , health insurance lobbyists say .That has raised the stakes for the 2012 election and the Supreme Court , which will hear three days of arguments this month on whether the law is constitutional .
As a kind of companion piece to my last post on the liberal and conservative visions for health insurance , I strongly recommend reading this post by Mike Konczal , which strikes a note that you can expect to hear sounded more often on the left if the Obamacare rollout continues to go badly . Contra conservatives suggesting that HealthCare.gov represents some kind of discrediting moment for liberalism , Konczal argues that the potential policy problems associated with a nonfunctional web portal really just point to the problems with neoliberalism — a much-debated term of art , but defined for his purposes as the post-1970s idea that social insurance should be “heavy on private provisioning and means-testing , ” that it should preserve as much “choice and competition” as possible , and that it should be delivered at the state level or through state-and-federal coordination rather than by the federal government alone .It’s precisely these elements in Obamacare , he writes , that threaten to turn an IT mess into a policy disaster , because they have forced policymakers to build exchanges with too many moving parts , figure out sliding subsidies , and make sure to fine-tune things so that health insurers play ball and stay solvent . Whereas under “the older , New Deal form of liberalism , ” there would just be a straightforward universal federal guarantee of health insurance — and if the website didn’t work , well , it would be an inconvenience but not really a problem for the underlying policy . ( “My man Franklin Delano Roosevelt may not have known about JavaScript and agile programming , ” Konczal quips , “but he knew a few things about the public provisioning of social insurance.” )His post then goes on to pick up on my Sunday column’s point that a neoliberal policy failure here could present problems for any kind of conservative alternative:Some of the more cartoony conservatives argue that this is a failure of liberalism because it is a failure of government planning … However , the smarter conservatives who are thinking several moves ahead ( e.g . Ross Douthat ) understand that this failed rollout is a significant problem for conservatives . Because if all the problems are driven by means-testing , state-level decisions and privatization of social insurance , the fact that the core conservative plan for social insurance is focused like a laser beam on means-testing , block-granting and privatization is a rather large problem .To which I would just say that the problems I foresee are more political than intellectual or conceptual . If the Obamacare exchanges are a mess and the individual market is facing cost spirals , then conservatives are going to face some understandable skepticism ( more even than usual ! ) from voters if they talk up the virtues of free market health care and the individual marketplace in 2016 and beyond . But in principle , the distinction between Obamacare’s approach to health policy and the conservative version of means-testing , block-granting , and competitive marketplaces is clear enough . That’s because while Obamacare may be using neoliberal rather than New Deal-style means , it’s still chasing essentially left-of-center ends : It seeks a level of universality and comprehensiveness that conservatives don’t think is necessarily worth pursuing . And it’s that quest , those goals , that require the complicated mandate-regulate-subsidize combination that could undo the individual marketplace if the enrollment isn’t where it needs to be and the subsidies and fines and regulations aren’t successfully fine-tuned .In other words , pace Konczal , the potential problems with Obamacare aren’t necessarily “driven by means-testing , state-level decisions and privatization of social insurance.” They’re driven by the law’s attempt to employ these ( notionally ) decentralized means while still seeking essentially centralized ends . Thus Obamacare retains a big role for private insurers … so long as they agree to behave more like public utilities than traditional insurance companies . It leaves a major role for the states … so long as they build their exchanges and spend their Medicaid dollars the way the federal government says . It lets individuals shop for insurance plans that suit their needs … but restricts the kinds of plans that they’re allowed to buy . And this mismatch of ( or , if you prefer , dishonesty about ) means and ends does , indeed , require a level of complicated regulatory fine-tuning that’s a lot more vulnerable to IT glitches than a single payer system would be .But these problems don’t loom nearly as large in the conservative alternative . You aren’t trying to get everyone comprehensive coverage , so you can offer most people a flat tax credit rather than trying to hit a precise subsidy level for every would-be buyer . You’re trying to deal with uninsurable people separately rather than folding them into the same insurance pool as everyone else , so you don’t have to promise insurance companies a vast new market of “young invincibles , ” design a mandate that nudges these invincibles into the system , and then hope that enough of them sign up . And you aren’t trying to micromanage what happens at the state level to the same degree , so you’d probably face fewer conflicts and fewer surprises the Obama White House has had to deal with on that front .Now the cost of this more decentralized approach is , admittedly , that it leads to something less than universal , comprehensive coverage . My previous post tried to tackle whether the potential benefits might outweigh that cost . But whether they do or not , at the very least such a reform would be much less vulnerable than Obamacare to the kind of problems cropping up this month .
As health reform moves to its final , make or break vote — I think it’s going to go through , but I’ll be hanging on by my fingernails all week — Republicans are still denouncing it as a vast , evil government takeover . But they have a problem : Obamacare is very much like the Massachusetts health reform , which was not only implemented by a Republican governor , but by a governor who is a serious contender for the 2012 presidential nomination .So they insist that the two plans have nothing in common — but the only real difference they can point to is that Massachusetts didn’t fund its plan in part out of Medicare savings .Of course , it couldn’t . But think about this a bit more : Republicans are saying that what makes Obamacare a socialist takeover , whereas Romneycare wasn’t , is the fact that unlike Romney’s plan , Obama’s plan cuts government spending .Oh , Kay .
As long as I’m talking about alternative health care bills , it’s worth lingering over some of the latest news about the bill we actually got . First , the C.B.O . has released a new estimate of how much additional discretionary spending — on implementation costs , further subsidies for new and existing programs , etc . — health care reform is likely to generate over the first 10 years . The total comes to $ 115 billion above and beyond the official price tag , a sum that would almost wipe out the bill’s projected deficit savings in the first decade .Keep in mind that — as Ezra Klein points out — this is spending that Congress will need to appropriate anew every year , and since we’re ( theoretically ) operating under a domestic spending freeze , it will ( theoretically ) all have to be offset with cuts elsewhere , or else be voted down . So that $ 115 billion estimate might not be quite as bad as it sounds . But given how hard it is to find offsets and/or kill off existing programs , the C.B.O . estimate certainly isn’t good news for America’s finances .Nor is the news that Reihan Salam took note of last week , which bears on one of the potential fiscal time bombs embedded in reform — namely , the possibility that far more companies will offload their employees into the new government-run exchanges than the C.B.O.’s official estimate predicts . There’s a penalty for dropping coverage , but for many employers the move would end up saving them ( and their workers ) a lot of money , the penalty notwithstanding . And if enough decide to take advantage , the government could find itself spending billions more in subsidies than the C.B.O.’s projections anticipate , driving health care reform deep into the red .Now a Fortune piece offers evidence that a number of large employers are considering doing exactly that . It comes courtesy of Henry Waxman , who helpfully demanded that AT & T , Verizon , Caterpillar and Deere turn over internal documents justifying their post-reform writedowns . These documents , it turns out , included internal memos weighing the pros and cons of dropping coverage:AT & T produced a PowerPoint slide entitled “Medical Cost Versus No Coverage Penalty.” A document prepared for Verizon by consulting firm Hewitt Resources stated , “Even though the proposed assessments [ on companies that do not provide health care ] are material , they are modest when compared to the average cost of health care , ” and that to avoid costs and regulations , “employers may consider exiting the health care market and send employees to the Exchanges.” ( Under the new bill , employees who lose their coverage will purchase health care through state-run exchanges . )Kenneth Huhn , vice president of labor relations at Deere , said in an internal email that his company should look at the alternatives to providing health benefits , which “would amount to denying coverage and just paying the penalty , ” and that he felt he already had the ability to make this change under his company’s labor agreement . Caterpillar felt it would have to give “serious consideration” to the penalty option .It’s these analyses — which show it’s a lot cheaper to “pay” than to “play” — that threaten to overthrow the traditional architecture of health care .Of course that traditional employer-based architecture is a mess anyway , so there’s a sense in which the more people who shift on to the exchanges the better . The problem is figuring out how to pay for it . In an ideal world , Washington would respond to a bigger-than-anticipated shift by slashing the subsidies and deregulating the exchanges , until you ended up with a system where the federal government was effectively paying for universal catastrophic coverage , rather than trying to subsidize comprehensive insurance . ( The end result would be something that looked a bit like Wyden-Bennett , and a bit like Judd Gregg’s stillborn compromise . )But in a less-than-ideal world , the Fortune piece notes , the fiscal picture will get very ugly very quickly:What does it mean for health care reform if the employer-sponsored regime collapses ? By Fortune’s reckoning , each person who’s dropped would cost the government an average of around $ 2,100 after deducting the extra taxes collected on their additional pay . So if 50 % of people covered by company plans get dumped , federal health care costs will rise by $ 160 billion a year in 2016 , in addition to the $ 93 billion in subsidies already forecast by the CBO .I’ll leave the last word to The New Yorker’s John Cassidy , discussing just this problem with the current reform package : “At that point , if it comes , politicians of both parties will be back close to where they began : searching for health-care reform that provides adequate coverage for all at a cost the country can afford . What would such a system look like ? That is a topic for another post , but I don’t think it would look much like Romney-ObamaCare.”
As my colleague Margot Sanger-Katz notes , a Supreme Court ruling against the Obama administration in King v. Burwell would cause significant disarray in health insurance markets , by denying subsidies to anyone buying health insurance on the individual market in states that rely on the federal health insurance exchange .Just because some insurance markets would become a mess does not mean Republicans and Democrats would come back to the table to fix them .Health insurance would become unaffordable for many people who do not get it through work or Medicare . The individual mandate wouldn’t apply to people who couldn’t afford coverage without a subsidy . And as healthy people drop out of the insurance market because of rising costs , the pool of participants could get sicker , driving premiums up further , driving even more people out of the market , and leading to what is known as a death spiral where only a handful of mostly very sick people buy insurance at a very high price .That would be a bad outcome . But it would not necessarily be an unsustainable one . I know , because this situation was sustained in New York for over two decades before Obamacare came into being .Two cornerstones of the Affordable Care Act are policies called community rating and guaranteed issue . Community rating means a health insurer can’t set the price of your insurance policy based on how much it’s likely to cost to cover you . Guaranteed issue means they must sell health insurance to anyone who wants it . These policies mean that healthy people will tend to pay more for insurance than they get back in claims , and sick people will tend to pay less than they get back .To make the market work , you have to induce healthy people to buy insurance that’s worth less than it costs . The health law does this by offering subsidies to people who buy insurance , imposing penalties on people who don’t , and limiting insurance purchases to a short “open enrollment” period of just a few weeks each year , so people don’t wait until they get sick to buy coverage . A ruling for the plaintiffs in King would abolish the subsidies in some states and significantly weaken the individual mandate , too .Before 2014 , New York also had community rating and guaranteed issue . But it didn’t have an individual mandate , premium subsidies or a limited open enrollment period . The result was that insurance was extremely expensive in the individual market , and very few people bought it .As of 2008 , just 2 in 1,000 New York State residents were covered through the individual insurance market . In 2012 , when I was a freelancer , I considered buying insurance in the individual market ; I found that a plan approximating my prior employer coverage would have cost about $ 16,000 a year . In the group market , which was not totally dysfunctional , my prior employer was paying less than $ 6,000 for similar coverage .This was terrible public policy that led to a lot of people going uninsured . ( For my mother’s benefit , I’ll note that I remained on my former employer’s plan through 2012 , as permitted for a limited period under the federal law known as Cobra . ) But it was not unsustainable policy . New York started guaranteed issue and community rating in the early 1990s and went through two decades of individual market dysfunction .It’s not hard to understand why . Repealing community rating ( i.e. , letting insurance companies charge sick people more ) is unpopular . Providing subsidies so healthy people find it affordable and appealing to buy insurance is expensive . So New York stuck with a set of policies in which health insurance was available to everyone at a price that was affordable to almost no one .There seems to be an idea among some conservatives that a post-King reality would be so messy and untenable that Democrats would have to come back to the table to cut a new deal on health reform . But King could just create a bunch of new New Yorks , where the individual insurance market doesn’t work , and nobody does anything to fix it .The dysfunction would be especially sustainable since death spirals under King probably wouldn’t be quite as severe as in New York . That’s because the A.C.A . uses a modified version of community rating in which prices can vary based on age , and because the limited period for open enrollment still provides a disincentive to forgo insurance coverage if you are healthy . So , not as many healthy people would flee the market as they did in New York .Still , premiums would rise , as would the percentage of the population without insurance , and Democrats would have a simple prescription : Introduce a state-based insurance exchange , and the market will function again because the subsidies will flow again . The politics of the situation would probably be similar to the politics of the Medicaid expansion now , with Democrats saying it’s crazy to turn down free money , doctors and hospitals ( and the uninsured ) saying that even more loudly , and Republicans being caught between the broad interests of the electorate and the Obamacare hatred of their base .As with the Medicaid expansion , some Republican officials would choose to cooperate with the health care law . Their argument for doing so would be even stronger than with the Medicaid expansion , for two reasons . One is that while the federal government pays for most of the cost of the Medicaid expansion , it pays for the entire cost of subsidies for individual market health insurance plans .The other is that , by imposing community rating and guaranteed issue on the whole country , the A.C.A . has prevented states from returning to the previous status quo in their individual health insurance markets . A ruling that overturns King won’t just take away subsidies from people with low and moderate incomes ; it will drive up premiums for everyone in the individual health insurance markets in every state that does not run its own exchange . And while affordability tests will exclude many low- and moderate-income people in these states from the individual mandate , some people with higher incomes will be ordered to buy these newly expensive plans or else face a penalty .Republican state officials will be able to say ( accurately ) that the federal government has imposed costly and disruptive regulations on the state that can be managed effectively only by taking the federal money . That is , they can set up a state exchange , while bitterly complaining that the odious President Obama left them no choice but to do so .Or , they can stand firm and let their individual insurance markets become dysfunctional . It worked for New York . Sort of .
As the Disney-Marvel mash-up `` Big Hero 6 '' moves toward its big-action finale , the images will look strikingly familiar . A supervillain wreaks havoc . A portal to another dimension looms . A showdown goes airborne over a metropolis .It could be the finale of a dozen superhero films , with one difference : `` Big Hero 6 '' is animated . But the majority of comic-book films are also computer-generated , particularly their large set pieces . Never has that been clearer than witnessing just how similar such scenes look as out-and-out cartoons . It 's a little like seeing that the superhero has no clothes .The 3-D `` Big Hero 6 '' is loosely based on a little-known Marvel comic about a team of superheros . Crafting a more kid-friendly version , Disney ( which owns Marvel ) has focused on one of the heroes , the aptly named Hiro Hamada ( voiced by Ryan Potter ) .With his older brother , Tadashi ( Daniel Henney ) and their aunt Cass ( Maya Rudolph ) , the 14-year-old Hiro lives in San Fransokyo , a beautifully rendered fusion of Tokyo and San Francisco , full of both nighttime neon and steep-hilled , Bay-area panoramas .Hiro , whose parents died when he was a toddler , is an avid gamer happy to use his technical wizardry hustling unwitting competitors in underground `` bot fights . '' His tiny , gingerbread man-sized robot makes mincemeat of more hulking machines .Tadashi disapproves but does n't lecture Hiro , instead casually exposing him to his college , San Fransokyo Tech . Though Hiro initially dismisses it as `` nerd school , '' he discovers it to be a vibrant breeding ground of invention . He 's wowed by Tadashi 's schoolmates — Wasabi ( Damon Wayans Jr. ) , Honey Lemon ( Genesis Rodriguez ) , Gogo ( Jamie Chung ) and Fred ( T.J. Miller ) — and their gizmos .None is more impressive than Tadashi 's robot , a marshmallow balloon `` personal health care consultant '' named Baymax ( Scott Adsit ) , created with a `` non-threatening , huggable '' design . He 's like an Obamacare dream , had the president drifted off during a Michelin commercial .With a quick scan , he can diagnose any ailment . Looking Hiro over and detecting mood swings , he pronounces : `` Diagnosis : Puberty . '' When his battery life wanes , he loses air pressure and begins to drunkenly slur his speech .In short , he 's an irresistible Disney supporting player , one who will give Groot , the soulful treelike alien of `` Guardians of the Galaxy , '' a run for sidekick-of-the-year .After a mysterious fiery accident at an invention showcase , Hiro and Baymax set off on an adventure that will gradually gather all the expected superhero conventions , slowly draining the movie 's innovative Silicon Valley spirit .So buoyant is the first half of `` Big Hero 6 '' and so colorful is its bright , Japanese anime-inspired palette , that the film 's slide into familiar comic book-movie ruts comes as a disappointment . Could it not have stayed in its rich robotics world as a high-tech high-school tale ? Are such Earth-bound stories no longer possible for big-studio animation ? Ca n't a kid grow up without flying up ?Directed by Don Hall ( `` Winnie the Pooh '' ) and Chris Williams ( `` Bolt '' ) , `` Big Hero 6 '' is a fine blend of sweetness and spectacle , East and West . The meeting of Disney and Marvel sensibilities , though , is a more mixed union . When the young Hiro and the lovable Baymax strap on the body armor , girding for battle , the movie 's charms are camouflaged .`` Big Hero 6 '' is preceded by a lovely little short , `` Feast , '' a tale of a Boston Terrier 's devotion to his owner , told exclusively , and cleverly , through mealtime .

As the promoters of a sweeping education referendum in Colorado look to Election Day next Tuesday , they worry about many factors , including what kind of voter turnout they can expect in an off year and whether Americans in an anti-tax era will choose to pay more , as the referendum calls on them to do , even if the money is guaranteed for kids and schools .They worry about something else , too .Obamacare .It’s their unlucky timing that they’re asking Coloradans to give the government an extra $ 950 million a year at a moment when the botched Obamacare rollout is in the news and being easily—and inevitably—cast as an example of government incompetence .I wrote about the referendum , on what’s called Amendment 66 , in my Tuesday column , which provides details on the tax increase and the shrewd grab bag of education reforms it would buy . I absolutely think they’re worth the price .And I quoted the savvy chief architect of the education overhaul , Mike Johnston , a young Democratic state senator who has become a deeply admired figure among education reformers nationwide .In one of our telephone conversations , Johnston noted that he makes four or five speeches to voters about Amendment 66 every day , and that over the last week , people in his audiences have begun , with some frequency , to bring up the Obamacare rollout . The proposed Colorado education overhaul includes a promise of greater transparency : specifically , that parents can go to a web site and navigate it to see exactly how much of the state’s allotment of funds for their child is being used for classroom instruction versus administration or something else . This would be a new service .“I’ll get questions from groups when we talk about the transparency we want to provide , ” Johnston told me . “They’ll say , ‘I hope it’s not being done by the same people who are running the Obamacare site’.”These aren’t just little barbs , he said .“The impact of both the shutdown and the Obamacare rollout is that it’s become very easy for people to lose faith in the effectiveness of government , ” he said .That’s one of the truly infuriating and insidious aspects of the Obama administration’s bungling of the web site , and it’s a consequence that could linger long after the web site is fixed . At a time of great skepticism about what big government can provide and how fully it can be trusted , the Obama administration let its signature policy add to those doubts and become fodder for people who maintain that government must always be shrunken and that all genius dwells in the private sector . The rollout will potentially undermine faith in much more than just the Affordable Care Act .My colleague Michael D. Shear articulated this well in a story in The Times over the weekend . He wrote:In his biggest and most important speeches , the president often talks with passion about a “smarter , more effective government.” He has called on Congress to embrace and pay for a “21st century government that’s open and competent.” And he has vowed to work to “rebuild people’s faith in the institution of government.”But in the pursuit of that lofty goal , Mr. Obama faces determined opposition from conservatives who view government as the problem , not the solution . And to succeed , he must win over an increasingly skeptical public whose trust in government has eroded over decades . A survey last week by the Pew Research Center found that just 19 percent of Americans trust government to do what is right just about always or most of the time .The breakdown of the federal HealthCare.gov Web site could emerge as a test of Mr. Obama’s philosophy , with potentially serious implications for an agenda that relies heavily on the belief in a can-do bureaucracy . Michael Dimock , the Pew center’s director , said that the longer the problems persist , the more they could bolster what he called the “almost American value that government is inefficient.”On the heels of Shear’s story was another fascinating report from another colleague at The Times , Trip Gabriel , who notes how far state governors are separating themselves from what’s happening in Washington . Here’s a snippet:Ever since Republicans in Congress shut down the federal government in an attempt to remove funding for President Obama’s health care law , Republican governors have been trying to distance themselves from Washington .Gov . Scott Walker of Wisconsin schooled lawmakers in a Washington Post opinion column midway through the 16-day shutdown on “What Wisconsin Can Teach Washington.” Gov . Chris Christie of New Jersey , with a record of bipartisan support at home , remarked after a visit to the nation’s capital , “If I was in the Senate right now , I’d kill myself.”Those governors are beating up not just a Democratic administration but also their Republican kinfolk on Capitol Hill . And they’re doing something bigger in the process : trying to make sure voters don’t conflate state governments with the federal government . These governors know that there may be big things they want and need to get done , and if voters turn off on government in general—on all of it—then voters won’t follow them when they need for that to happen .Johnston , in fact , said he’s experienced firsthand the way voters can fail to make distinctions between different levels of government and can see government as one big morass , one big mess . During the federal shutdown , he said , he sometimes fielded questions about whether , as a state senator , he had the day off . Of course he didn’t .To this point , he said , the shutdown has had a much more corrosive effect on trust in government than the Obamacare rollout , though the latter hasn’t helped matters . He worries that the two together have made the challenge of selling Amendment 66 tougher than it might otherwise have been .“The big question is : do you trust government to be good stewards of your money at this time in American history ? ” he said . “And the context in Washington makes that doubtful.”
At this point , the crisis in American governance has taken on a life of its own . Some Republicans are now saying openly that they want concessions in return for reopening the government and avoiding default , not because they have any specific policy goals in mind , but simply because they donât want to feel âdisrespected.â And no endgame is in sight .But this confrontation did start with a real issue : Republican efforts to stop Obamacare from going into effect . Itâs long been clear that the great fear of the Republican Party was not that health reform would fail , but that it would succeed . And developments since Tuesday , when the exchanges on which individuals will buy health insurance opened for business , strongly suggest that their worst fears will indeed be realized : This thing is going to work .Wait a minute , some readers are saying . Havenât many stories so far been of computer glitches , of people confronting screens telling them that servers are busy and that they should try again later ? Indeed , they have . But everyone knowledgeable about the process always expected some teething problems , and the nature of this weekâs problems has actually been hugely encouraging for supporters of the program .First , let me say a word about the underlying irrelevance of start-up troubles for new government programs .Political reporting in America , especially but not only on TV , tends to be focused on the play-by-play . Who won todayâs news cycle ? And , to be fair , this sort of thing may matter during the final days of an election .But Obamacare isnât up for a popular referendum , or a revote of any kind . Itâs the law , and itâs going into effect . Its future will depend on how it works over the next few years , not the next few weeks .To illustrate the point , consider Medicare Part D , the drug benefit , which went into effect in 2006 . It had what was widely considered a disastrous start , with seniors unclear on their benefits , pharmacies often refusing to honor valid claims , computer problems , and more . In the end , however , the program delivered lasting benefits , and woe unto any politician proposing that it be rolled back .So the glitches of October wonât matter in the long run . But why are they actually encouraging ? Because they appear , for the most part , to be the result of the sheer volume of traffic , which has been much heavier than expected . And this means that one big worry of Obamacare supporters â that not enough people knew about the program , so that many eligible Americans would fail to sign up â is receding fast .Of course , itâs important that people who want to sign up can actually do so . But the computer problems can and will be fixed . So , by March 31 , when enrollment for 2014 closes , we can be reasonably sure that millions of Americans who were previously uninsured will have coverage under the Affordable Care Act . Obamacare will have become a reality , something people depend on , rather than some fuzzy notion Republicans could demonize . And it will be very hard to take that coverage away .What we still donât know , and is crucial for the programâs longer-term success , is who will sign up . Will there be enough young , healthy enrollees to provide a favorable risk pool and keep premiums relatively low ? Bear in mind that conservative groups have been spending heavily â and making some seriously creepy ads â in an effort to dissuade young people from signing up for insurance . Nonetheless , insurance companies are betting that young people will , in fact , sign up , as shown by the unexpectedly low premiums theyâre offering for next year .And the insurers are probably right . To see why anti-Obamacare messaging is probably doomed to fail , think about whom weâre talking about here . That is , who are the healthy uninsured individuals the program needs to reach ? Well , theyâre by and large not affluent , because affluent young people tend to get jobs with health coverage . And theyâre disproportionately nonwhite .In other words , to get a description of the typical person Obamacare needs to enroll , just take the description of a typical Tea Party member or Fox News viewer â older , affluent , white â and put a ânotâ in front of each characteristic . These are people the right-wing message machine is not set up to talk to , but who can be reached through many of the same channels , from ads on Spanish-language media to celebrity tweets , that turned out Obama voters last year . I have to admit , I find the image of hard-line conservatives defeated by an army of tweeting celebrities highly attractive ; but itâs also realistic . Enrollment is probably going to be just fine .So Obamacare is off to a good start , with even the bad news being really good news for the programâs future . Weâre not quite there yet , but more and more , it looks as if health reform is here to stay .
BATON ROUGE , La . — An old political standby — the future of Medicare — is emerging as the go-to issue in Louisiana 's bitter Senate race as the candidates woo seniors who typically wield strong influence in midterm elections .The challenge for voters is to figure out which side , if either , is telling the whole truth about who would cut and who would protect the popular insurance program . Medicare serves more than 50 million people and accounts for about 15 percent of federal spending , with about 10,000 new beneficiaries added daily as baby boomers reach age 65 . The issue is so powerful that it 's cropping up in North Carolina and Iowa , too , amid a national battle for control of the Senate .Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu got hundreds of seniors grumbling at a recent forum when she told them her top Republican rival , Rep. Bill Cassidy , wants to turn Medicare into a `` voucher system '' and has voted to raise the retirement age to make Americans wait longer for benefits .`` No wonder Bill Cassidy did n't come today , because he did n't want you to know this , '' said Landrieu , who finds herself in another tough re-election bid as she seeks a fourth term .Landrieu has made the issue of entitlement programs for the elderly a centerpiece of her campaign , traveling Tuesday to three senior centers across south Louisiana to announce a new endorsement from the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare , a Washington-based advocacy group .The Senate Democrats ' campaign arm has aired an ad against Cassidy featuring three older white women — a crucial demographic for Landrieu in a state that President Barack Obama twice lost badly — bemoaning Cassidy 's plan that `` ( requires ) seniors to buy private insurance with fewer benefits and higher costs . '' Democrats have hit Iowa Republican Senate nominee Joni Ernst with similar ads .Cassidy and his backers answer that it 's Landrieu who cut Medicare when she voted in 2010 for Obama 's signature health care overhaul , which reduced payments for private policies under the Medicare Advantage program .Americans for Prosperity , the political action organization backed by the conservative billionaire Koch brothers , Charles and David , cites that Affordable Care Act vote in similar ads opposing Landrieu and her North Carolina colleague , Sen. Kay Hagan .The three races are among the handful that will decide which party controls the Senate for the final two years of Obama 's presidency . Republicans must net six more seats for a majority .The back-and-forth reprises a major theme of the 2012 presidential election . Obama and Republican nominee Mitt Romney leveled the same attacks , with Romney prevailing among voters older than 55 . The issue also helped Republicans in 2010 , when the GOP used dissatisfaction and confusion over the new health care law to win a House majority .While Republican Medicare attacks are based on the health care law , the Democratic attacks are based mostly on House Republicans ' budget blueprint , the Paul `` Ryan Budget , '' so-named for the Wisconsin congressman and budget chairman who was Romney 's running mate .The Affordable Care Act changed how Medicare pays doctors and hospitals and included reductions — the $ 700 billion in cuts the GOP cites — in Medicare Advantage , which allows seniors in certain markets to purchase coverage from private insurers .Ryan 's budgets , meanwhile , propose a long-term shift to a voucher system for seniors ' health care , where beneficiaries would get taxpayer money and then choose among traditional Medicare and private policies sold on the open market — similar to the exchanges the health care law set up for working-age Americans . The House has stopped short of passing legislation that would actually implement the overhauls assumed in their budget plans , and the budget votes have been largely symbolic anyway since Republicans have the political cover of a Democratic Senate , which routinely kills legislation passed in the House .Medicare 's latest annual report , issued this summer , projects that the program 's hospital trust fund wo n't be exhausted until 2030 , at which time payroll taxes are projected to cover just 85 percent of Medicare 's costs . Yet each side persists in attacking the other 's proposals as untenable `` cuts . ''`` The $ 700 billion that Obamacare cut from Medicare spends it on other programs , '' Cassidy said , referring to the law shifting some health care spending to premium subsidies for working-age policy holders . `` The $ 700 billion in the Ryan budget puts it back into the trust fund . ''Landrieu and Democrats argue that the new law covers more Americans and , thus , lowers health care costs across the board by saving on treating the uninsured .Democrats also note Congressional Budget Office projections that premiums for traditional Medicare could nearly double under the Ryan proposal , leaving seniors to choose the more expensive public insurance or less expensive private plans with lower benefits and more out-of-pocket expenses .Analyses from the insurance industry and independent groups note that under both parties ' models there would be rural areas where private firms may not offer policies at all .Landrieu 's most aggressive criticism of Republican Medicare plans , meanwhile , ignores that the changes would not affect anyone who is old enough now to qualify for Medicare . That means none of those voters Landrieu stirred up at a senior center would be forced off traditional coverage under plans Cassidy has supported .Nonetheless , Landrieu defends her attacks . `` You can only judge what somebody 's going to do based on what they 've already done , '' she said .___Barrow reported from Atlanta .

BATON ROUGE , La . — The last of the Deep South 's statewide elected Democrats are hoping their seniority and famous family names will save them from the region 's rightward trend in this year 's Senate races . But Republicans say only one name matters in these rapidly realigning states : Barack Obama .In Louisiana and Arkansas , Republican Senate candidates appear increasingly confident that they can focus almost exclusively on their opponents ' ties to the president , who lost both states badly . They say it 's time for the two states to bring Senate elections in line with the heavy GOP tilt of recent presidential results .It no longer matters , Republicans say , that Sens . Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Mark Pryor of Arkansas hail from famous Democratic families and have seniority in Washington .`` We 're running against Sen. Landrieu and Barack Obama , '' says Rep. Bill Cassidy , a Republican seeking to end Landrieu 's career at 18 years . Asked about the legacies of Landrieu 's father , Moon , and brother Mitch — the former and current mayors of New Orleans — Cassidy shrugged .`` If you go to our focus groups , I do n't know if her name matters as much , '' he said . He said voters instead note that `` she voted for health care , and she says she 'd vote for it again . '' He was referring to the president 's health care overhaul , also known as `` Obamacare . ''In Arkansas , Pryor emphasizes his home-state ties , and often mentions his father , David , who was a popular governor and senator . `` When my dad was governor , '' Pryor told retirees in Pine Bluff on Wednesday , `` he had a big senior initiative '' called Area Agency on Aging .His Republican opponent , Rep. Tom Cotton , focuses on more recent history . He says Pryor `` votes 93 percent of the time with Barack Obama , '' and that should disqualify him in a state the president lost by 24 percentage points .Pryor and Landrieu are campaigning hard , imploring voters to reward their seniority and familiarity even if it means keeping Obama 's party in control of the Senate .`` I 've lived here my whole life , '' Landrieu told a Baton Rouge gathering on a warm afternoon . She said her brother , `` the New Orleans mayor , '' is working with her to end homelessness among military veterans . And after three Senate terms , she said , she finally chairs the Senate Energy Committee , important to the state 's oil and gas industry .It 's crucial `` to maintain the seniority and the clout that we have in Washington , '' Landrieu said . `` It 's your clout , it 's not mine . It 's Louisiana 's clout . ''GOP leaders say seniority is a poor excuse for electing Democrats in a state that overwhelmingly rejected Obama and put Republicans in control of the state government . Landrieu `` uses her clout for Barack Obama , '' Cassidy says .Moon Landrieu and David Pryor prospered in a time when Democrats dominated their states , and residents put higher values on pork barrel projects , committee chairmanships and other fruits of seniority . These Democratic family legacies , southern politicians say , are increasingly imperiled by hostility to Obama and Democrats ' national image .For Landrieu , `` it makes it very , very difficult for re-election , '' said Jonathan Dean , the Democratic mayor of the small , central Louisiana town of Ball .Dean calls himself `` a conservative , pro-life , pro-Second Amendment Democrat , '' a brand still successful in many local southern elections . In a sign of Landrieu 's challenge , he 's endorsing no one in the Senate race .Landrieu replaced her campaign manager this week , and Cassidy cites polls showing him ahead . He has agreed to only two October debates with Landrieu , who says he 's afraid to have more encounters .She pointed to his empty seat at a recent evening forum in the somber city council chambers of Kenner . Landrieu dryly thanked tea party-backed Republican Rob Maness `` for having the guts '' to attend .Maness , seen as running a distant third , attacks Landrieu and Cassidy about equally . His presence raises the likelihood of a Dec. 6 runoff , probably between Cassidy and Landrieu .In Louisiana 's `` jungle primary , '' all candidates , regardless of party , run on the Nov. 4 ballot . If no one exceeds 50 percent , the top two finishers enter a runoff .In a runoff , Republicans will `` have the enthusiasm advantage , '' said GOP Sen. David Vitter of Louisiana . Speaking at a National Right to Life endorsement of Cassidy , Vitter called Landrieu `` truly extremist . ''Landrieu , sometimes speaking in the third person , says she 's a centrist `` willing to cross party lines '' to help her state with matters such as flood insurance . Congress is often gridlocked by partisanship , she told the Kenner forum , `` but Mary Landrieu and the way I work is not . ''Some people wonder whether Cassidy is playing it too safe , relying almost entirely on anti-Obama sentiment and overlooking Landrieu 's history of scratching out tough wins .`` I do n't think he has defended himself enough '' and explained his positions , said Joanie Bernius of Metarie , who attended the Kenner forum . Bernius said she has voted for Landrieu before but no longer tolerates her support for legalized abortion .___Associated Press Special Correspondent David Espo in Pine Bluff , Arkansas , contributed to this report .
BATON ROUGE , La . — U.S. Sen. Mary Landrieu has doubled down on her support for the federal health care law even as polls show the revamp remains unpopular in Louisiana and a new Republican attack ad launched Tuesday hits the Democratic incumbent again for her vote .The 30-second TV commercial by national conservative group Crossroads GPS , co-founded by GOP operative Karl Rove , says Landrieu 's vote for President Barack Obama 's signature initiative was a betrayal of Louisiana .Although criticism of Landrieu 's vote for the law known as `` Obamacare '' has continued throughout the election season , the three-term senator has n't sidestepped the issue . In the latest Senate race debate Monday night in New Orleans , Landrieu offered a direct defense of the law in advance of the Nov. 4 election .She said while the health overhaul needs adjustments , it will improve health care access .`` I 'm telling you this is a good bill . It 's not perfect , '' Landrieu said . She added : `` I will defend it . I will improve it . And I will fight for it . ''Landrieu is a target for national Republicans as they seek to regain control of the Senate . She is the only Democratic statewide elected official in Louisiana , which strongly supported Mitt Romney in 2012 . If no candidate gets a majority of the vote next week , the Senate race will head to a Dec. 6 runoff .Landrieu 's GOP opponents , U.S. Rep. Bill Cassidy and retired Air Force colonel Rob Maness , have repeatedly attacked her on the health care law . Both are campaigning on repeal of the law and accuse Landrieu of being a rubber stamp for Obama .In the New Orleans debate , which Cassidy did n't attend , Maness described the law as `` an abomination '' and a job-killer for small businesses . To lower health care costs , he said , Congress should not mandate coverage but consider allowing people to buy insurance across state lines and keep their insurance when they change jobs .Landrieu said the law is `` based on free market principles . '' She said she 'd like to see a lower-cost set of insurance plans offered , but also defended existing coverage options .`` Seventy percent of the people in our state , households , make less than $ 50,000 . The Affordable Care Act is the first act that 's given those families a chance to buy insurance , and the average premium is $ 83 a month for them . That 's affordable , '' Landrieu said .Despite Landrieu 's continued support for the health law passed in 2010 , the issue is n't a winning one in her home state .A USA Today/Suffolk University poll released this week shows 62 percent of Louisiana voters surveyed believe the federal health law is `` generally bad '' for the state .More than 100,000 people in Louisiana signed up for private insurance coverage through the federally-run marketplace created by the law , which offers subsidized options for people who do n't get insurance through their jobs or a government program like Medicare .But Republicans point to double-digit premium hikes for many of those policies next year and penalties for people who refuse to get insurance .Meanwhile , much of the expanded coverage authorized through the federal law has n't trickled down to Louisiana . Gov . Bobby Jindal , a Republican considering a 2016 presidential campaign , has refused to expand Louisiana 's Medicaid program , rejecting the federally-funded coverage that could have been offered to the working poor .
BERKELEY Calif. ( Reuters ) - Voters in California 's Alameda County passed a measure on Tuesday that is expected to raise $ 100 million a year for health clinics for illegal immigrants , who are excluded from state programs and the federal Affordable Care Act , or Obamacare .On May 23 a measure to include illegal immigrants in the state 's Medi-Cal program for the poor to residents who are undocumented stalled in the state senate , and immigration reform proposals have also stalled in U.S. Congress for the past year .The measure extends a 0.5 percent sales tax to fund the clinics to 2034 from 2019 .`` Our elected officials , our constituents , and our health authority see healthcare as a basic human right , to be provided regardless of immigration status , '' Alex Briscoe , Director of the Alameda County Health Care Services Agency , said .About 7 percent of California 's population - 2.6 million people - are undocumented , and in 2012 the state spent more than $ 600 million on emergency room and other health-related services alone for people living in the state illegally .Many of those who used the facilities in the past will now be eligible for insurance under Obamacare or the Medi-Cal program , leaving a potential funding gap for the clinics that are already struggling to meet the needs of patients expected to be increasingly those without documents or health insurance .Alameda County , which includes the cities of Berkeley and Oakland east of San Francisco , funds health care services for about 50,000 undocumented residents at the clinics .The measure passed by a nearly 3-to-1 margin with all precincts reporting results early on Wednesday .( Reporting by Jennifer Chaussee ; Editing by Sharon Bernstein and Louise Ireland )
BIRMINGHAM , Alabama — A congressional candidate in Alabama is taking aim - literally - at the federal statute known as Obamacare in a new campaign advertisement in which he fires rounds from several weapons into a paper copy of the healthcare reform law .Will Brooke , a Birmingham businessman , is one of seven Republican candidates seeking to replace U.S. Representative Spencer Bachus , who is retiring .In the video , released on Wednesday , Brooke loads a thick stack of papers into a target and then fires multiple rounds from a pistol , rifle and AR-15 assault rifle at it . None of the bullets manage to destroy the copy of the Affordable Care Act , Democratic President Barack Obama 's signature healthcare law .`` Well we had some fun and knocked some holes in it , but we did n't quite get the job done , '' Brooke said in the ad . `` Looks like we 'll have to resort to more extreme measures to get rid of Obamacare and replace it with a market-based solution . ''The candidate then loads the stack into a wood chipper to shred the pages in the video 's final scene .Brooke hopes to get some attention by having fun with a serious subject , he said in a statement , vowing to fight the law that he said has caused insurance premiums in Alabama to rise and resulted in thousands of residents losing their health coverage .The Alabama Democratic Party did not respond immediately to calls for comment on the ad .( Reporting by Verna Gates ; Writing by Colleen Jenkins ; editing by Gunna Dickson )
BOSTON — A group of cyber security professionals is warning that the U.S. government has failed to implement fixes to protect the HealthCare.gov website from hackers , some three months after experts first pointed out the problem .David Kennedy , head of computer security consulting firm TrustedSec LLC , told Reuters that the government has yet to plug more than 20 vulnerabilities that he and other security experts reported to the government shortly after HealthCare.gov went live on October 1 .Hackers could steal personal information , modify data or attack the personal computers of the website 's users , he said . They could also damage the infrastructure of the site , according to Kennedy , who is scheduled to describe his security concerns in testimony on Thursday before the House Science , Space and Technology Committee .`` These issues are alarming , '' Kennedy said in an interview on Wednesday .The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services , the federal agency that oversees the site 's operations , provided Reuters with a statement saying it takes the concerns seriously .`` To date there have been no successful security attacks on HealthCare.gov and no person or group has maliciously accessed personally identifiable information from the site , '' the statement said .`` Security testing is conducted on an ongoing basis using industry best practices to appropriately safeguard consumers ' personal information . ''HealthCare.gov lets consumers shop for insurance plans under President Barack Obama 's Affordable Care Act , which mandates health insurance for all Americans .The site , which is meant to serve millions of consumers in 36 states , was crippled by technology errors in the first two months after its launch on October 1 . The Obama administration 's efforts to repair the site helped it to work more smoothly beginning in December , but problems with data transmission remain .Kennedy said he last week presented technical details describing the vulnerabilities in the site to seven independent cyber security experts , who reviewed videos of potential attack methods as well as logs and other documentation .They wrote notes to the House Committee saying they were concerned about the site 's security , which Kennedy provided to Reuters and will be released on Thursday to the committee led by Republicans who oppose the Affordable Care Act .Members of the security community have been publicly pointing out problems with the site and say they have been privately providing the government with technical details of those issues since early October .At a November Science Committee hearing , Kennedy and three other expert witnesses said they believed the site was not secure and three of them said it should be shut down immediately .'FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED 'Kennedy and his peers who reviewed his work ahead of Thursday 's hearing said the site still has serious security vulnerabilities that can be viewed from the outside .`` The site is fundamentally flawed in ways that make it dangerous to people who use it , '' said Kevin Johnson , one of the experts who reviewed Kennedy 's findings .Johnson said that one of the most troubling issues was that a hacker could upload malicious code to the site , then attack other HealthCare.gov users .`` You can take control of their computers , '' said Johnson , chief executive of a firm known as Secure Ideas and a teacher at the non-profit SANS Institute , the world 's biggest organization that trains and certifies cyber security professionals .He declined to provide further details about that vulnerability , saying he was concerned the information could be used by malicious hackers to launch attacks .Kennedy said he learned of that particular attack method from another security researcher who had identified and tested it .Yet Kennedy said he identified many other problems on his own , conducting what is known as `` passive analysis '' of the site , by using an ordinary Web browser and other software tools to look at HealthCare.gov 's content and architecture from the outside .He said he did not take the additional step of hacking into the site to look for other problems because he did not have permission from the government .'ONLY SPECULATING 'Waylon Krush , chief executive of a firm known as Lunarline that has done security work for the Department of Health and Human Services , said he questions Kennedy 's conclusions that were drawn without launching attacks on the website .`` Anybody who brings testimony that says there is a vulnerability on HealthCare.gov is only speculating unless they have actually executed the code , at which point they are hacking a government website and that would be illegal , '' said Krush , who will also testify before the committee on Thursday .Krush said he has not reviewed Kennedy 's findings or done any work on the HealthCare.gov site itself .`` If I said everything was perfect , I would just be speculating because I did not work on the site , '' he said .One security flaw that Kennedy first uncovered and reported to the government in October exposes information including a user 's full name and email address . He said he wrote a short computer program in five minutes that automatically collects that data , which was able to import some 70,000 records in about four minutes .He said the information was accessible via the Internet and he did not have to hack the site to get it . He declined to elaborate .John Strand , a principal with Black Hills Information Security and a SANS Institute trainer who also reviewed Kennedy 's findings , said he was concerned about what might have been uncovered if Kennedy had conducted a more in-depth probe and actually attempted to hack into the site .He said he supports a recent move by the House of Representatives to force the government to disclose breaches whenever they occur . The government is generally not required to notify the public when its systems are compromised .`` We do n't know how bad it is because they do n't have to tell us , '' Strand said .Lamar Smith , the Texas Republican chairman of the committee , said in a statement that the government should quickly move to plug the security flaws that have already been reported by security experts .`` If Americans ' information is not secure , then the theft of their identities is inevitable and dangerous , '' he said . `` The President should take swift action to ensure that the American people are not the next target of cyber criminals .

BOSTON — New competition between health insurers offering so-called Obamacare plans in 2015 is having an impact on the pricing of such coverage , based on a first look at proposed insurance premiums , the head of Humana Inc said on Wednesday .The state insurance exchanges offering coverage under the Affordable Care Act . President Barack Obama 's landmark healthcare law will begin enrolling customers for 2015 benefits in mid-November . Now in its second year , Obamacare is attracting health insurers to offer plans in more states after over 8 million people enrolled for coverage in 2014 .The country 's largest insurer , UnitedHealth Group Inc , sold Obamacare plans in only a few states in 2014 . But for 2015 , it will sell plans in about two dozen states . Aetna Inc , Cigna Corp , WellPoint Inc and Humana have said they would stick to most of their markets .`` United is coming in . There is more competition coming into the marketplace . It 's going to make us all a little bit more competitive , '' Humana Chief Executive Officer Bruce Broussard said in an interview .He said that larger insurers are pricing their premiums within a narrower range of about 10 percent in many markets . That strategy contrasts with 2014 , when Obamacare plan pricing showed much greater variation .Humana will sell plans in 15 states for 2015 and has asked for premium rate increases of 3 percent to the 20 percent range , depending on the market .Last year , large insurers were hesitant to enter the new marketplace , concerned by conservatives ' political opposition as well as federal regulations that required that the plans be available to any individual regardless of age or health status .When the exchanges first launched in October 2013 , technology failures crippled the federal enrollment website , Healthcare.gov , and many websites run by individual states . But as the government fixed those problems , enrollment came in ahead of forecast .Now many insurers expect their Obamacare business to have profit margins of 2 percent to 3 percent within a few years , based on government forecasts for the market to grow to 13 million people in 2015 and 25 million by 2017 .Broussard said insurers may grapple with customer churn as consumers seek better prices as well as more technology problems as existing customers try to re-enroll either in the same plan or in a new plan for 2015 .Humana , which has about 700,000 members enrolled in Obamacare plans , has a large business providing medical benefits and prescription drug plans under the Medicare program for the elderly , and sees a risk posed by pricey new drugs expected to reach the U.S. market in the next few years .Insurers are already calling for a change in how new drugs are priced after paying more than they expected for Gilead Sciences Inc 's new $ 84,000 Hepatitis C treatment . New personalized treatments for cancer and an experimental class of cholesterol fighting drugs are seen inflating those costs further .`` We 've had a great trend over the last couple of years in healthcare cost staying flat or decreasing , '' Broussard said . `` If these drugs come out at the price they are , I think you are going to see a reversal of that .

BOSTON — The failed Scottish vote to pull out from the United Kingdom stirred secessionist hopes for some in the United States , where almost a quarter of people are open to their states leaving the union , a new Reuters/Ipsos poll found .Some 23.9 percent of Americans polled from Aug. 23 through Sept. 16 said they strongly supported or tended to support the idea of their state breaking away , while 53.3 percent of the 8,952 respondents strongly opposed or tended to oppose the notion .The urge to sever ties with Washington cuts across party lines and regions , though Republicans and residents of rural Western states are generally warmer to the idea than Democrats and Northeasterners , according to the poll .Anger with President Barack Obama 's handling of issues ranging from healthcare reform to the rise of Islamic State militants drives some of the feeling , with Republican respondents citing dissatisfaction with his administration as coloring their thinking .But others said long-running Washington gridlock had prompted them to wonder if their states would be better off striking out on their own , a move no U.S. state has tried in the 150 years since the bloody Civil War that led to the end of slavery in the South .`` I do n't think it makes a whole lot of difference anymore which political party is running things .

Back to Congressional gridlock . Back to watching John Boehner provide exciting updates like âweâre continuing to work with our members.â Maybe , if the stalemate goes on long enough , he will once again tell reporters : âIf ands and buts were candy and nuts , every day would be Christmas.â I always enjoy that part .Tra-la-la .For the last few weeks , weâve been awash in worries about profound problems in foreign affairs , but now weâre going domestic again . Weâre back in budget crisis territory . Compared with Syria , it seems like a walk in the park . Good old fiscal cliffs .Itâs possible youâve lost track of this over the summer , so I have prepared a calendar of upcoming events . Feel free to put it on the refrigerator:Sept. 23 : House of Representatives goes away . For a weeklong vacation . Because , you know , they need to see the folks back home that they didnât see when they were there all of August.Â Itâs possibleÂ that the Republican leadership will cancel their long-scheduled break rather than let it be said that the House only spent nine working days in Washington in the month before the federal government shut down . Which we would definitely be saying .Oct. 1 : Government shuts down ! Do not plan a vacation in a national park for early October .A critical chunk of House Republicans insist that they will only vote for a bill to keep government going if said legislation also defunds Obamacare . You may have noticed that House Republicans have a stupendously high opinion of health care reform . Most Democrats think it will be a very good thing over the long run , but probably a pain to implement , with lots of complaining from all sides . Republicans , on the other hand , think that the instant it goes into effect , voters will be so ecstatic they will toss out any public official who threatens to take it away from them . Yet , simultaneously , the world as we know it will come to an end . Go figure .Since neither the Senate nor the president will buy the defunding idea , Speaker Boehner came up with an interesting compromise , under which the House would pass a bill that keeps the government running and defunds Obamacare . But it would be structured so that the second part would vanish when the bill got to the Senate .There are a lot of procedural details . But , really , all you need to remember is : âBoehner bill : Obamacare defunding part disappears by magic.â The Tea Party faction in the House does not appear to be fooled by this maneuver .Date to be announced : Government starts up ! If there is a shutdown , it wonât last long . Probably no longer than the moment when voters begin to wonder about the clerks who process Social Security checks .This is a good moment to mention the sequester . I could have brought it up earlier , but you had a lot on your plate with the disappearing Obamacare thing .Of course you remember the big , bipartisan budget deal in 2011 , with all the automatic , irrational cuts to federal agencies that would go away as soon as Congress came up with a sensible bipartisan budget plan . Just look at that sentence again , and ask yourself how we ever imagined that one would work .Weâve already had one sequester , which has hacked into education funds , money for research and long-term upkeep of the parks . This week , Michael Schmidt of The Times reported that the F.B.I . has a cost-cutting plan to shut down its offices 10 days a year . In case of a terrorist attack , furloughed agents will be called in from home .The second phase will start to be felt over the next few months . Itâs particularly hard on defense contracts , so many members of Congress would like to see it adjusted . Some of us , of course , would prefer to get the F.B.I . back . Anyway , the issue is going to come up , and I donât want to see you throwing yourself under the bed the first time you hear the word âsequester.â Weâre better than that .Oct. 18 : First possible day for Treasury default if Congress canât come up with a bill to raise the debt ceiling . If there is no deal , financial markets around the world fall into chaos . President Obama goes to bed and has a wonderful dream in which he is working everything out with House Republicans , who are led by Kevin Spacey from âHouse of Cards.âThe Republicans have myriad proposals for dealing with the debt ceiling , many involving doing something bad to Obamacare . The presidentâs position is that Congress has an obligation to pay our already-existing national debt , and that , therefore , he is not going to negotiate the matter at all . Maybe Vladimir Putin has an idea .Jan. 1 : New sequester cuts really kick in and first Obamacare insurance policies go into effect . The moon turns to blood . Thor , son of Odin , fights in combat with the serpent JÃ¶rmungandr . The president contemplates the fact that he has three more years in office .
Because I was teaching from 6 to 9 last night , I’m behind on the big wonkverse thing of the day , the new CBO report that , among other things , increases the budget office estimates of labor supply effects ; it now says that affordable care will reduce labor supply by the equivalent of 2 million jobs .That’s a valid point . And CBO , wich has been burned before on this sort of thing , really needs to be more careful in how it states things — a lot of the press ran with the headline “Obamacare costs 2 million jobs” , and it will become part of what everyone on the right “knows” , yet is totally untrue . First of all , we’re mainly talking about reduced hours rather than quitting the work force . Second , as Greg Sargent and Jonathan Cohn try to explain , we’re talking about a voluntary , supply-side response here — people choosing to work less — not about job destruction .Still , don’t we have a problem with incentive effects here ? Maybe , but maybe not . I’ll write this up at greater length later , but the basic point here is that we started with a system in which incentives were already strongly distorted by the deductibility of employer-paid health insurance premiums . This was a significant benefit , but one in general available only to full-time workers .The result was to create something like the infamous “notches” sometimes created by welfare state benefits — but in reverse . The traditional notch comes when , say , housing subsidies are available as long as you’re below 150 percent of the poverty line — which means that you have a strong disincentive to move your income from slightly below to slightly above that threshold . What we had here was , instead , a system in which subsidies were available only if you worked more than a certain amount , surely leading some people to work more than they would have wanted to otherwise .And that’s not a hypothetical — I know a fair number of people in just that situation . I also know some people in “job lock” — feeling trapped in their current job because they aren’t sure they could get implicitly subsidized health insurance if they moved .Does the reverse notch plus job lock mean that the CBO’s estimate of work reduction ( NOT job loss ) actually represents a gain in welfare ? It might or might not — the traditional tradeoffs surely apply to many workers too . But you don’t want to assume that it’s obviously a bad thing . Health reform isn’t an intervention in a previously undistorted economy ; you might say that it replaces one set of distortions with a different set of distortions .And the one thing that remains clear is that it will be a big plus for the people who most need help .
Ben Sasse , a Tea Party favorite making his first run for public office , won election to the United States Senate , and another Republican , Pete Ricketts , was elected governor .Mr. Sasse , a rising conservative star , defeated the Democratic candidate , Dave Domina , a plaintiffs’ lawyer , and will take the seat being vacated by Senator Mike Johanns , a Republican .When he announced his candidacy last year , Mr. Sasse , who is president of Midland University in Fremont , Neb. , called himself the “anti-Obamacare candidate.” He has a bachelor’s degree from Harvard and a Ph.D. from Yale , and he served under President George W. Bush as an assistant secretary of health and human services .Mr. Ricketts , the governor-elect , is a former chief operating officer of Ameritrade , the online brokerage based in Omaha . He defeated Chuck Hassebrook , the Democratic candidate , who received a $ 100,000 contribution from Warren Buffett .Mr. Ricketts , who spent millions of dollars of his own money in an unsuccessful campaign for the Senate in 2006 , cited his business experience as an asset in this year’s race .Representatives Adrian Smith and Jeff Fortenberry , both Republicans , easily won re-election .Mr. Smith returns to Washington for a fifth term from a district that covers the western three-fourths of Nebraska . Republicans have held the seat for more than 50 years . Mr. Smith defeated the Democrat , Mark Sullivan , a farmer and feedlot owner .In the First District , Mr. Fortenberry beat Dennis Crawford , a lawyer who said he wanted to increase spending on highway construction and wind energy .

By now , I’m sure you’re asking yourself : If the Republicans take control of the Senate in next week’s elections , what would it mean to me ?Excellent question !“We’ll get things done , and it means a stop to the Obama agenda , ” said the embattled Senator Pat Roberts , Republican of Kansas . Did you notice that “get things done” is immediately followed by “stop ? ” What do you think that means ?Well , we know that if the Republicans win the majority , all Senate committees would have Republican chairs . The Energy Committee , for instance , might be run by Lisa Murkowski of Alaska , a moderate who is in the pocket of oil and gas lobbies . This would be a dramatic change from the current situation in which the Energy Committee is run by Mary Landrieu of Louisiana , a moderate who is in the pocket of oil and gas lobbies .On a far more exciting note , the Environment Committee could wind up being led by James Inhofe , the author of “The Greatest Hoax : How the Global Warming Conspiracy Threatens Your Future.”Under the Republicans , the Senate would be an extremely open body , in which the minority party would be permitted — nay , welcomed — to submit clever amendments designed to make the majority take difficult or embarrassing votes that could be used against them in the next election . The minority leader , Mitch McConnell , has complained about the Democrats’ heavy-handedness on this for years and will undoubtedly be eager to change things if he gets in control .And what about substance ? Republican voters would have every reason to expect that the first item on McConnell’s agenda would be repeal of Obamacare . But many Republican senators have positions on the Affordable Care Act that are nuanced in the extreme . Get rid of the program but keep the part about people with pre-existing conditions . Or the bit that lets young adults stay on their parents’ policies . McConnell himself has said that he wants to let his home state of Kentucky keep its extremely popular version of the program , which is known as Kynect . ( “The website can continue , but in my view the best interests of the country would be achieved by pulling out Obamacare root and branch.” )We look forward to seeing that legislation .Cynical minds might presume that , with a Republican majority , the Senate would simply continue in its current state of dysfunction , working diligently on an agenda ( defund Planned Parenthood , strangle the Environmental Protection Agency in its crib ) that will die for lack of 60 votes . Democrats , meanwhile , would fall back in love with the filibuster .Or maybe not . Some people believe that the Republicans would be eager to prove that they really , actually , genuinely can get things done and would work with the White House on matters of common interest , like tax reform .“Tax reform” would probably mean lowering some rates and making up for the lost revenue by closing tax loopholes elsewhere . The House Ways and Means Committee did some work on that recently , and the committee chairman actually unveiled a plan . Then John Boehner made fun of him . The plan never came up for a vote . The chairman is retiring .There are a few matters in which a Republican Senate majority would make a critical difference . One is the budget . This is stupendously important , but since we may have to spend the next two years discussing fiscal cliffs and the rules of reconciliation , it doesn’t seem fair to make us start early .Also , there’s the matter of presidential nominations . “Two words : Supreme Court , ” said Chuck Schumer , the third-ranking Senate Democrat . “If they have the majority , they have far more say over who’s the nominee.”That could have an impact for decades to come . However , it presupposes that there will be a Supreme Court vacancy . On the plus side , the next two years will be a boom time for prayers for the good health of Ruth Bader Ginsburg .Presuming the current justices continue in good form , the Republicans could still block other presidential nominations and we would have to get used to government by acting-heads-of . But that’s already pretty close to the norm . One Republican representative recently denounced President Obama for creating an Ebola czar instead of giving the job to the surgeon general , apparently unaware that we have had no surgeon general for more than a year , thanks to the National Rifle Association’s opposition to the administration’s nominee for the job .Tracked down by The Huffington Post , Representative Jason Chaffetz of Utah claimed he really did know the surgeon general’s post was vacant , and that anybody from the office could still do the Ebola job . “I know there’s some confusion there , but I don’t think I was confused , ” he said stoutly .See , Representative Jason Chaffetz is perfectly willing to live with an acting surgeon general . And maybe someone could talk Eric Holder into hanging around for a while longer .
CAMBRIDGE , Maryland — President Barack Obama sought on Friday to ease strains with his Democratic allies in the U.S. Congress , who are fearful they could face election consequences from the botched rollout of the president 's signature healthcare law known as `` Obamacare . ''Speaking to House of Representatives Democrats during their three-day retreat , Obama cited an increase in the number of people signing up for insurance coverage under Obamacare as evidence that the law 's implementation was going more smoothly after a troubled start .Republicans , who have denounced Obamacare as an unpopular disaster , have put the issue at the center of their strategy for November 's congressional elections .But Obama has touted the administration 's progress in ironing out the glitches . At the retreat , he predicted that the 2010 Affordable Care Act will be seen by Americans in five to 10 years as `` a monumental achievement . ''`` We now have well over 3.5 million people who have signed up and are getting insurance through the marketplaces for the first time , '' Obama said .All 435 House seats along with 36 of the 100 Senate seats are up for grabs in the elections .Republicans are expected to retain the House , which they now control 232-200 with three vacancies . They hope the Obamacare issue will help them seize control of the Senate , which Democrats hold 55-45 .The troubles with Obama 's healthcare law have weighed on the president 's popularity . His approval rating now stands at 43 percent , and Democrats worry that Americans ' concerns about the health law could cost them support in their districts .Traditionally , presidents have seen their party lose seats in congressional elections during their second terms , largely due to voter fatigue with incumbents .Since 1946 , when a president 's approval rating was below 50 percent in such elections , his party has lost on average 36 House seats , according to the Gallup polling firm . When it is above 50 percent , they lose on average 14 seats , Gallup said .The healthcare issue was an important topic at the Democratic gathering at a waterfront resort . Before Obama spoke , the Democrats heard during a closed session from Ari Goldmann , a 32-year-old independent contractor and waiter who lives in Washington .A Democratic aide said Goldmann told the lawmakers he was `` beyond thrilled '' when he was able to get health coverage under Obamacare after his insurance company told him it was canceling his plan .Democrats hope to circulate more such stories in the months ahead as they scramble to win public approval of Obamacare and boost their election prospects .At a closed-door portion of his meeting with Democrats , another party aide said Obama told the gathering that `` underlying policies in the ( healthcare ) program are working , but of course there are glitches . We are working through these things . ''Obama also discussed his legislative agenda for this year , including a push to raise the minimum wage and renew expired jobless benefits for nearly 2 million Americans .Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida , who chairs the Democratic National Committee , underscored her party 's support of the president 's efforts .She declined to say , however , if it will be enough for Democrats to somehow win back the House .`` We are not making predictions , '' Wasserman Schultz said . `` We are focused on making sure that when it comes to giving people opportunities to climb the ladders of the middle class , that voters understand that Democrats have their backs . ''Representative Joseph Crowley of New York made reference to the snowstorm in the area when he introduced Obama at Friday 's gathering . Crowley said it had been a `` marvelous two days despite the weather and the odds against us .

CAMBRIDGE , Mass . — Remember the Affordable Care Act , the Obama administration’s signature health care plan ? Of course you do : For four years , it was at the epicenter of a vicious partisan battle in the United States , the subject of town meetings , congressional debates and talk show vitriol , not to mention the target of more than 800,000 negative television ads that cost an estimated $ 450 million .Then there was the disastrous rollout in late 2013 , caused by computer glitches that cost the program precious credibility at a critical time .That’s what most people remember — which might explain why some Republicans seeking election next month are still running attack ads against the health care law . The problem with that narrative is the program is proving to be a success , and yet the health care initiative — arguably the most significant piece of social legislation in decades — is no longer a prominent part of the Democratic agenda .“The program has turned a corner , ” said Anton Gunn , a former South Carolina state legislator and health care expert , now on a fellowship at the Institute of Politics at Harvard . According to government figures released in September , 7.3 million people had signed up and paid for health plans delivered by state and federal exchanges as of mid-August ; the total is more than 10 million if children on parental plans are included , according to Mr. Gunn .Not bad for a program that opponents argued would ruin small businesses , put families at risk , force citizens to drop existing insurance policies and generally destroy America with a lethal dose of European-style socialism .Never mind that most Europeans like their health care systems , and were typically horrified to learn that some 40 million Americans had no health insurance at all . The fact that the number of uninsured is now dropping should be good news not only for the United States itself , but also for its image in the world .Yet Democratic candidates are largely shying away from the issue in this election season , as described in a recent talk at Harvard by Amy Walter , an editor of the Cook Political Report , a nonpartisan group that analyzes campaigns . Democrats have calculated that they have nothing to gain by bringing it up . For one thing , most Americans are unaffected by the new plans because they are insured through their employer . For another , health insurance is the kind of complicated issue that gets little traction on the campaign trail .What does resonate in the Republican-leaning states is the word Obamacare , the informal if widely used name for the program that serves as a handy proxy for an increasingly unpopular president . This is where the ads have had their biggest effect . “They don’t like him , so they don’t like it , ” said Mr. Gunn .But as the program picks up enrollees , even Obama-bashers are having to shift targets . “It’s not the focus of the G.O.P . anymore , ” Mr. Gunn said . “They’re onto other issues — ISIS , Ebola , which I’m sure they’ll figure out a way to blame Obama for.”Already , some of the health program’s fiercest opponents are turning themselves into pretzels over the issue . The Senate minority leader , Mitch McConnell , running for re-election in Kentucky , has argued that “the best interest of the country would be achieved by pulling out Obamacare , root and branch , ” while at the same time , defending Kentucky’s health insurance exchange , which has enrolled 500,000 people .Experts expect enrollment to climb to 13 million people after the second application period opens on Nov. 15 . They also predict that state lawmakers will start to see a political benefit to participating in a program that obliges states to expand Medicaid , the program that subsidizes health care for the poor , at the federal government’s expense .Drew Altman , president of the Kaiser Family Foundation , recently wrote that the attraction of federal funds and the votes of the newly insured “may gradually trump ideology , ” prompting the 23 states that initially refused to participate in the Medicaid expansion to opt in .“Once we’re past the election season , we can start working on testimonials about Obamacare , calling people out on it , ” Mr. Gunn said . Until then , the program’s supporters are staying mum .
CHARLESTON , South Carolina — South Carolina lawmakers failed to derail implementation of President Barack Obama 's signature health care law in the state when a measure was defeated in the Republican-controlled Senate .Last year , the state House passed a bill that nullified the law by calling for criminal penalties for anyone who sought to enforce it . Late Wednesday night , however , Senators voted 33-9 to defeat an amendment regarding the Affordable Care Act , commonly known as Obamacare .The amendment would have banned state agencies and employees from helping to carry out the health care law . It would have required healthcare navigators who help people sign up for health insurance to be licensed by the state .Republican supporters argued they wanted to prevent the federal government from `` commandeering '' state resources in order to make the law work .The effort was being followed closely by Republican lawmakers in other states looking for ways to defeat the health insurance legislation , which was passed in 2010 and survived legal challenges all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court .In striking down the measure , South Carolina Lt. Gov . Glenn McConnell , the Senate president and a Republican , cited procedural rules that required the Senate to follow the original House bill 's aim without adding new issues .Democratic Senator Bradley Hutto said efforts to nullify the law would invite a federal lawsuit against the state .`` Nullification is a concept that is legally dead . It 's fraught with issues , '' Hutto said .`` We 've been down that road before , '' Democratic Senator John Matthews Jr. said , referring to South Carolina 's nullification of federal laws in the years before the U.S. Civil War , whose first shots were fired in the state .`` It did n't work then and it 's not going to work now , '' he said .About six states have barred their employees from helping implement Obamacare , according to Richard Cauchi , the healthcare program director for the nonpartisan National Conference of State Legislatures . At least eight states , including two that support the healthcare reforms , have regulated navigators , he said .( Corrects to state House passed a bill , not an amendment , paragraph 2 )( Editing by Kevin Gray and Grant McCool )
CHARLESTON , South Carolina — South Carolina lawmakers say they have found a way to stop implementation of the U.S . Affordable Care Act in their state , an effort that could provide a template for other Republican-led legislatures looking to derail the federal program .The proposed measure would ban state agencies from helping carry out President Barack Obama 's signature healthcare reform law and prevent federal money flowing through state coffers from being spent on it , said Republican state Senator Tom Davis .The legislation would give South Carolina oversight of insurance rates offered through its federal exchange and require healthcare navigators , which help people sign up for the healthcare benefits , to be licensed by the state , said Davis , who chairs the committee drafting the measure .The state 's 2014 legislative session opens on Tuesday .`` Even though the federal government may pass a law , and even though that law may be constitutional , that does n't mean that the federal government can direct the state to spend state dollars to implement it , '' he said . `` States are n't simply political subdivisions of the federal government . ''Six states have barred their employees from helping implement the law known as Obamacare , said Richard Cauchi , healthcare program director for the nonpartisan National Conference of State Legislatures .At least eight states , including two that support the healthcare reforms , have regulated navigators , he added .The new laws are mostly legally untested , Cauchi said .`` Florida and Ohio have said : 'We will have nothing to do with this law ; we wo n't make it workable , ' '' he said . `` At what point does state inaction constitute interference with a federal law ? ''Last fall , a federal judge blocked Tennessee 's `` emergency rule , '' which would have fined healthcare navigators for helping people find insurance under the Affordable Care Act .In December , Georgia lawmakers said they would follow South Carolina 's lead this year in trying to prevent state agencies from taking part in Obamacare . With many legislatures convening this month , it is too soon to tell what other states will consider new obstacles to the law , Cauchi said .Last year , South Carolina 's House of Representatives passed legislation to nullify Obamacare , but Davis said that effort clearly would not have passed legal muster .The state senator said he believed the rewritten bill , which he expects to be taken up for debate in a few weeks , would have teeth .Opponents of the federal law are looking to South Carolina for a `` template , something that other states can follow , '' Davis said . `` It 's like we 're holding the fort until we can get people in Congress that can repeal or replace it . ''He said he expected Democratic opposition and would need almost every Senate Republican 's vote to stop a filibuster .Critics of the South Carolina measure said the new attack on the Affordable Care Act was political theater .`` It is going to hurt people being able to access the marketplace because some of the navigator teams will pull out , '' said Brett Bursey , director of the South Carolina Progressive Network , a nonprofit coalition of liberal groups .If the measure becomes law , it probably will face legal challenges from opponents , said Gibbs Knotts , chairman of the political science department at the College of Charleston .`` It 's blocking access to something provided by the federal government , '' Knotts said . `` There 's all sorts of unfunded ( federal ) mandates that the states have to play a role in .

CHICAGO — Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana and two smaller insurers will delay implementing policies to stop poor HIV patients from paying for Obamacare plans with funds from the federal Ryan White HIV/AIDS assistance program .The decision , which the insurers revealed at a federal court hearing on Tuesday , prompted the judge to lift a temporary restraining order that forced them to delay the change in policy for 14 days .On Monday , Brian Jackson , chief judge of the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana , issued the order that would have compelled the companies to accept Ryan White funds to pay insurance premiums on behalf of HIV patients .HIV advocates called the ruling a victory because the companies will now continue to accept payments using federal funds until March 31 , three weeks after the date the temporary restraining order would have expired .`` This is an important first step in preserving critical health insurance coverage for low-income individuals living with HIV and in halting the deliberate insurance industry practice of discriminating against people with HIV in general , '' said Scott Schoettes , senior attorney and HIV Project Director at Lambda Legal . The nonprofit group brought the lawsuit on behalf of John East , a part-time worker in the hospitality industry , and other low-income Louisianans living with HIV .Jackson has scheduled a March 10 hearing for a preliminary injunction to require the insurers to continue accepting the payments for the duration of the litigation .The insurers named in the case are Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana , Vantage Health Plan and Louisiana Health Cooperative . They are among a small handful of insurance companies in Louisiana that sell healthcare policies under President Barack Obama 's healthcare law .Without an injunction , low-income individuals with HIV who elect to stay in one of the plans offered by the three insurers will need to pay their own healthcare premiums after March 31 .For more than two decades , poor people with HIV have used funds from the federal Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program to buy health insurance they could not otherwise afford .But earlier this month , Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana began rejecting Ryan White payments sent on behalf of HIV patients who had enrolled in one of its Obamacare plans . Subsequently , the two smaller insurers followed suit .The insurers told healthcare advocates that guidance issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , the lead Obamacare agency , prevented them from accepting third-party payments for the new health plans , even when the funds came from a government program .Earlier this month , the CMS said that guidance did not apply to the Ryan White program . The federal agency also said it is considering amending rules to require issuers to accept Ryan White payments .Louisiana Blue , which had planned to stop honoring Ryan White and other third-party payments for premiums as of March 1 , said in a statement on Tuesday it will hold off on that policy until March 31 .John Maginnis , a spokesman for Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana , said in a statement that extending the deadline `` gives people more time to shop for the right healthcare plan for themselves and their families in the Marketplace , including finding out whether they may be eligible for a subsidy , or tax credit , to help them pay the cost of their healthcare premiums . ''The company will honor all premium payments , including those received from third parties , such as the Ryan White program , through March 31 , Maginnis said .After that , individual policy holders will have to submit their monthly payments directly .`` We are working to let our individual policyholders know about this forthcoming requirement , giving them more time to prepare and shop for plans in the Marketplace while enrollment is still open , if they are eligible , '' he said .Insurance experts point out that once one carrier in a market institutes policies that drive away potentially high-cost customers such as people with HIV-AIDS , other carriers feel pressure to do the same for fear of being the only one to cover them , a situation called adverse selection .Earlier this month , Lambda Legal filed an administrative complaint with the Office of Civil Rights of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services , CMS 's parent agency , against Louisiana Blue , Vantage and Louisiana Health Cooperative , arguing that their refusal to accept Ryan White payments flouted a key provision of the ACA , namely its requirement that insurers accept any customer regardless of health status .( Reporting by Julie Steenhuysen in Chicago ; Additional reporting by Sharon Begley in New York ; Editing by Jan Paschal and Richard Chang )
CINCINNATI — Once again , Judge Jeffrey S. Sutton was the unpredictable man in the middle on a major national issue .The 2003 George W. Bush appointee who stunned some conservatives three years ago by ruling in favor of President Barack Obama 's health care overhaul also wrote the majority opinion Thursday in a 2-1 decision by the 6th U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals that upheld anti-gay marriage laws in Ohio , Michigan , Kentucky and Tennessee .Sutton wrote that such a major social change as redefining marriage should be decided through the political process , not the courts .He said it is better to have change `` in which the people , gay and straight alike , become the heroes of their own stories by meeting each other not as adversaries in a court system but as fellow citizens seeking to resolve a new social issue in a fair-minded way . ''The decision was at odds with rulings by four other federal appeals courts , creating a split that dramatically increases the likelihood the U.S. Supreme Court will take up the issue .The 54-year-old Ohio State University law school graduate has a reputation among lawyers and court-watchers as a thoughtful and thorough jurist whose conservatism does n't automatically mean conservative rulings .Sutton was the first Republican-appointed federal appeals court judge to give support to the Obama health care overhaul .`` By most accounts , he 's considered a conservative judge , yet he ruled against us in the Obamacare case , '' said Robert J. Muise , attorney for the American Freedom Law Center . `` I think it showed he 's a judge of integrity in the sense that he 's going to rule on the way he thinks the law is , not based on what somebody thinks he should rule . ''University of Richmond law professor Carl Tobias said Thursday 's ruling again shows Sutton `` tries to call them as he sees them , '' and demonstrates a belief that `` the voters and elected branches , rather than unelected judges , should make changes like marriage equality . ''During Aug. 6 arguments in Cincinnati , in which the panel heard six cases from four states in the biggest hearing of its kind on the issue , Sutton 's questions and comments made it apparent he would be the swing vote , if not which way he was headed .Judge Deborah Cook , also a George W. Bush appointee , appeared clearly in favor of the states ' arguments , while Judge Martha Craig Daugherty , appointed by Democratic President Bill Clinton , insisted that it is right for the courts to intervene when people are being deprived of their constitutional right to equal treatment .Some of Sutton 's questions signaled his eventual ruling , as he asked attorneys for same-sex couples whether the courts are the best place for legalizing gay marriage .`` I would have thought the best way to get respect and dignity is through the democratic process , '' Sutton said during the arguments .Sutton expressed a similar philosophy in the 2011 health care ruling , concluding Congress had the right to require people to buy health insurance or face a penalty . He wrote that time would show the strengths and weaknesses of the mandate , `` allowing the people 's political representatives , rather than their judges , to have the primary say over its utility . ''Sutton , state solicitor for Ohio in the late 1990s when Republican George Voinovich was governor , got his bachelor 's degree from Williams College and his law degree in 1990 . He clerked for Supreme Court Justices Lewis Powell and Antonin Scalia . The conservative Scalia a few years ago called Sutton `` one of the very best law clerks I ever had . ''Bush nominated him to the federal bench in 2001 , but because of liberal opposition , he was n't confirmed until 2003 .California Sen. Dianne Feinstein , was one of only two Democrats to support his appointment to the appeals court , praising him as `` bright , well-qualified . ''`` I do n't think this man is going to be a biased judge , '' she said at the time .One of his former 6th Circuit clerks , Harvard Law School lecturer Leah Litman , said Sutton was tireless in working out his opinions , spending countless hours reading old rulings and seeking feedback from clerks and colleagues on arguments and counter-arguments .`` He really is everything you would want a judge to be , '' she said . `` He made me believe in the law .

COLUMBUS , Ohio — The pitch for health care coverage is being made at nail salons , pizzerias , mosques and even bars .As the second enrollment period under President Barack Obama 's health care law begins , advocates are employing new tactics and expanding old ones to reach people who need insurance . Some groups are targeting populations they believe slipped through the cracks during the last enrollment period .`` We 've had great success at laundromats , '' said Robin Stockton , the navigator program director for the Center for Family Services , a nonprofit based in Camden , New Jersey .The informal chat between wash-and-dry cycles can pique interest and lead some customers to call their hotline for more information , she said .`` Typically , '' she said , `` the question you get back is : 'Is this that Obamacare thing ? ' ''Open enrollment started Saturday and runs until Feb. 15 . The HealthCare.gov website , where people can sign up and search for coverage , appeared to be running smoothly Saturday .Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia M. Burwell tweeted that the website opened shortly after 1 a.m. , with more than 23,000 people submitting applications within the first eight hours . She said 1.2 million unique visitors looked at coverage using the site 's window-shopping tool in the last week .In Washington state , though , the health care exchange shut down after the first few hours of open enrollment as state officials and software engineers tried to resolve a problem with tax credit calculations .And just days before open enrollment , an old video clip surfaced showing an adviser who helped draft the law saying `` the stupidity of the American voter '' helped Democrats pass the complex legislation . Obama , just before leaving an economic summit in Australia on Sunday , said the public was not misled about provisions of the law . He said there was no provision that was not extensively debated or made fully transparent .The Obama administration aims to have 9.1 million paying customers enrolled in 2015 . That 's well below the 13 million that the Congressional Budget Office had projected .In Philadelphia , Enroll America organizer Neil Rickett is armed with a list of 500 bars and restaurants as he makes his way through downtown , popping in and out of eateries . He approaches bartenders , wait staff and other service industry workers whose high turnover and odd hours often result in a lack of health coverage . He gets workers ' contact information and sometimes schedules appointments to meet with them .`` By going to them , we 're upping our chance of getting the people we missed or did n't get enrolled last time , '' Rickett said .In New Jersey , Stockton 's nonprofit is among the community-based groups guiding people through the enrollment process . When they are n't taking appointments , the 17 navigators take their enrollment message on the road .The helpers set up tables of brochures at festivals and malls . They make cold calls to pizza parlors , Chinese restaurants and other small businesses where they sometimes post information on bulletin boards . And with encrypted tablets and mobile offices , they have signed people up for coverage at churches , synagogues , mosques and a Buddhist temple .`` We 're very flexible about the times that we can go out and make it convenient , '' Stockton said .The organization 's contact information in a newspaper caught the attention of freelance writer Susan Van Dongen Grigsby , who has COBRA coverage through her husband 's former employer , though it expires next year .`` I do n't want to find myself without any coverage a few months from now , '' said Van Dongen Grigsby , 55 , of Bordentown , New Jersey .Changing insurance has been on her mind since her husband retired in 2012 . She pays $ 689 a month and hopes to find a cheaper plan . She said that she resisted the marketplace last year because she liked her COBRA coverage and that hearing horror stories about the website did n't help .`` I just would like someone walk to me through it and see what the options are , '' said Van Dongen Grigsby , who has an appointment this month with Stockton 's group .One organization in northeast Ohio plans to host information sessions with salon owners and their employees to help enroll Asian-Americans in coverage .Cathy Vue , an assistant manager of Asian Services in Action Inc. , said the organization also is putting together a free calendar for Asian groups that will include Affordable Care Act information in their native language . Each page of the 12-month calendar will feature a picture of a community member — Nepali , Korean , Hmong , Burmese — wearing native clothing .`` This is kind of a way that we 're hoping will get the community involved , '' Vue said . `` A lot of times they feel invisible so to have that visibility , I think , is really powerful . ''Word of mouth from a client led personal trainer Arthur Hunter to seek enrollment help from The Voice of Your Customer , a minority-owned business in Cincinnati that has counselors assisting with sign-ups . Hunter has health insurance through his wife 's employer , though the two are getting a divorce . He hoped to get his coverage lined up Saturday .`` I do n't want to have a day go by without having it , '' said Hunter , 47 . `` Health and fitness is so important to me — that for me , one of the most important things is to have that health care coverage . ''Anne Filipic , president of Enroll America , said reaching the uninsured naturally will get harder from year to year as more people get coverage . Part of the challenge this period , she said , is for organizers not just to connect people to health insurance but also to make sure those enrolled keep their coverage and make any necessary updates .`` This year , we really have to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time , '' Filipic said .___Associated Press writer Sean Carlin in Philadelphia contributed to this report .
COLUMBUS Ohio ( Reuters ) - In the struggle within the Republican Party between the conservative Tea Party flank and moderates , Ohio Governor John Kasich is seeking to position himself as someone who can appeal to both sides .Kasich , a potential 2016 presidential contender , touts his zeal for tax cuts and balanced budgets . But he also says the Republican Party should be run “from the bottom up , rather than the top down , ” and do more to help the poor , mentally ill and incarcerated .“I think our actions have to reflect our rhetoric , ” Kasich told Reuters in an interview as he campaigned for Republican candidates in the industrial city of Youngstown ahead of Tuesday 's midterm elections . “So when we say we’re a party of opportunity , there should be ( opportunity ) , ” he said , adding that in Ohio , Republicans will “leave no one behind.”His message is an updated version of former President George W. Bush 's mantra of `` compassionate conservative . '' It is unclear if it would resonate well enough with Republican voters and donors to make Kasich a serious contender for the party’s presidential nomination .But in Ohio , a presidential battleground state , voters seem receptive . Polls show that in Kasich 's campaign to retain the governor 's office , he has a double-digit lead over Democratic challenger Ed FitzGerald ahead of Tuesday’s vote .When asked if he will seek the presidency , Kasich insisted he is focused on being governor . But he made clear he believes Ohio’s brand of Republicanism could play well nationally .“I’m hopeful that the things we are doing in the state will influence some of the strains of the Republican Party , ” he said , referring to differing currents within the party .During a three-day bus tour last week , Kasich emphasized caring for people with addictions , assisting the disabled and reducing offender recidivism .Republican candidates on the tour made stops on Thursday at a factory in rural Richland County , a family-owned deli west of Cleveland , a church in an Akron suburb and an air compressor distributor in the Democratic stronghold of Youngstown .At Dearing Compressor and Pump Co. , which has grappled with years of layoffs at auto and steel plants , Kasich told workers of his upbringing outside Pittsburgh by parents who were Democrats , suggesting his brand of Republican policies can work for Democrats too .“In 1980 , my dad thought about the country ... he voted for Ronald Reagan , lots of Democrats did , ” Kasich said to the subdued but polite crowd .OHIO SUCCESSES COULD BE SPRINGBOARDKasich , 62 , is a former U.S. congressman who won a tight race for governor against incumbent Democrat Ted Strickland in 2010 . After leaving the U.S. House of Representatives in 2001 he worked for the investment bank Lehman Brothers until its 2008 bankruptcy , a role highlighted by Strickland during the 2010 campaign . As he was leaving the House , he briefly explored a White House bid but had difficulty raising money .Kasich at times speaks in an offhanded manner . Shortly after being elected governor , he said to a group of state environmental workers that a police officer who ticketed him was an “idiot , ” angering the law enforcement officers union . A spokesman apologized for his word choice and Kasich later met with the officer and apologized to him in person .Public employees unions are still smarting over a Kasich-backed law early in his tenure to curb collective bargaining . Voters repealed the measure and Kasich opted to move onto other issues .Kasich often cites how Ohio has built up nearly $ 1.5 billion in savings in its “Rainy Day Fund , ” how the state 's unemployment rate is 5.6 percent , below the 5.9 percent nationwide unemployment rate , and how its credit rating has improved . The figures would support his image as a fiscal conservative during a White House bid .A new health office has allowed Ohio to reduce Medicaid spending , even while extending coverage to hundreds of thousands of additional low-income residents under the President Barack Obama 's Affordable Care Act .Kasich moved ahead with Medicaid expansion despite opposition from the Republican-controlled legislature . Many other Republican governors opted out of the expansion , an element of Obamacare . If Kasich decides to run for president , that could be heavy baggage in a primary , given the antipathy toward the law among Tea Party voters .Strategists say Kasich would have to play to the middle to be a viable White House contender . Texas Senator Ted Cruz and Kentucky Senator Rand Paul would draw grassroots support from the party’s conservative and libertarian wings .But the middle could be crowded . Potential candidates such as New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush are far better known nationally than Kasich and might amass campaign cash more easily .( Reporting By Amanda Becker ; Additional reporting by Gabriel Debenedetti in Washington ; Editing by Caren Bohan and Frances Kerry )
CONWAY , Ark . — Former President Bill Clinton urged voters in his home state Monday not to use the midterm election as a protest against the White House , as he toured the state to help Democrats ' efforts to prevent a GOP takeover in Arkansas .Clinton kicked off a series of rallies in Arkansas on Monday , praising Democratic candidates in close races for U.S. Senate , House and governor as people willing to work with both parties for the good of the state . He also criticized Republicans ' efforts to tie Democrats to President Barack Obama , who lost Arkansas in the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections and remains deeply unpopular in the state .`` They want you to make this a protest vote , '' Clinton told a crowd gathered at the University of Central Arkansas campus . `` All three of these races , they 're saying 'you may like these guys , but hey , you know what you 've got to do . You 've got to vote against the president . After all , it 's your last shot . ' ''Clinton appeared with Democratic U.S. Sen. Mark Pryor , who is locked in a tight and expensive fight for a third term against Republican U.S. Rep. Tom Cotton . The race could decide which party controls the U.S. Senate next year . Former North Little Rock Mayor Pat Hays , who is running for a central Arkansas congressional seat , and gubernatorial nominee and former U.S. Rep. Mike Ross , also shared the stage with Clinton .Noting that the president only has two years left on his term , Clinton added : `` It 's a pretty good scam is n't it ? Give me a six year job for a two-year protest . That 's Mark Pryor 's opponent 's message . ''Clinton 's visit comes as Republicans in Arkansas and other key states are seizing on the president 's recent remarks that though he 's not on the ballot , his policies are . A spokesman for Cotton cited those remarks as he downplayed Clinton 's visit and continued trying to paint Pryor as too closely aligned with Obama .`` We 're not bothered by President Clinton 's support of Senator Pryor , '' Cotton spokesman David Ray said in an email . `` What bothers us , and should bother all Arkansans , is Senator Pryor 's lock-step support of President Obama 's agenda , which he has supported 93 percent of the time -- including on Obamacare , the failed stimulus bill , the Wall Street bailout , judicial nominees -- you name it . ''Pryor , the only Democrat in the state 's federal delegation , accused Cotton of representing out-of-state groups more than the voters — a common theme during his re-election bid .`` He has his billionaires , but you know what I have ? I have you , '' Pryor said . `` I have the people of this state and that 's how we win this race . ''Clinton remains a beloved figure in Arkansas , where his presidential library is located and where the Little Rock airport is named for him and former first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton .He also boasts longstanding ties with the state 's top candidates this year . Pryor 's father , David , is a former governor and U.S. senator who was Clinton 's mentor . Ross got his start in politics driving Clinton around the state during the 1982 gubernatorial campaign . Hays is a longtime friend and supporter of Clintons .And James Lee Witt , who headed the Federal Emergency Management Agency under Clinton , is running for the south Arkansas congressional seat Cotton now holds .Clinton 's visit comes after a string of high-profile Republican surrogates campaigned in the state , including former Florida Gov . Jeb Bush and former presidential nominee Mitt Romney . The visits were designed in part to highlight the president 's unpopularity in Arkansas .Clinton also used his speech to praise Democratic Gov . Mike Beebe , who has remained popular in the state despite Republicans ' recent gains , and compared the state 's top candidates to him .Clinton also planned to headline a rally in Jonesboro on Monday , and two more in northwest Arkansas on Tuesday . The tour kicked off on the deadline to register to vote for the Nov. 4 election , and two weeks before early voting begins .`` Every vote counts , '' Beebe said . `` A big turnout means these folks win .

Casey B. Mulligan is an economics professor at the University of Chicago . He is the author of “The Redistribution Recession : How Labor Market Distortions Contracted the Economy.”From a tax perspective , the Affordable Care Act is in a different league than the Massachusetts health reform law passed in 2006 .The federal government and other advocates of Obamacare have dismissed concerns that the coming labor market contraction would be significant , or even noticeable , by pointing to Massachusetts’s experience with its so-called Romneycare system , also designed to expand insurance coverage . Because the Massachusetts labor market did not noticeably contract relative to the rest of the nation after its system went into effect , an official of the federal Department of Health and Human Services told The Washington Examiner that the experience in Massachusetts suggested “that the health care law will improve the affordability and accessibility of health care without significantly affecting the labor market.”Prof. David Cutler of Harvard recently addressed , on this blog , concerns about possibly adverse tax effects , saying , “Additional data from Massachusetts , where a state law was the precursor to the Affordable Care Act , suggests that the fears are overblown” and “at this point the evidence overwhelmingly suggests no need for major worry.” This position assumes that the Massachusetts system increased marginal labor income tax rates in the state by roughly the same magnitude that the Affordable Care Act will increase them in the United States ( by marginal labor income tax rate , I mean the extra taxes paid , and subsidies forgone , as the result of working , expressed as a ratio to the total compensation from working ) . This assumption is no longer necessary , because the methods I have used to measure marginal tax rates from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 , unemployment insurance expansions and the Affordable Care Act can also be applied to the Massachusetts health reform law . The results are shown in the chart below .The left bar shows that the Massachusetts law did , on average , increase marginal tax rates and thereby reduce the reward to working . But the impact was well under one percentage point , and for that reason it’s probably not surprising that , relative to other states that were not experiencing health reform , the Massachusetts labor market did not change noticeably after the law went into effect .The right bar shows the impact of the Affordable Care Act on nationwide marginal tax rates : it increases national rates about 12 times as much as the Massachusetts law increased rates . Earlier this year I explained why the Massachusetts law was so different from a tax perspective : among other things , its employer penalty is an order of magnitude less , the state’s population is not the same as the national population , and Massachusetts had already been helping unemployed people with health insurance .It follows that the effect of the Affordable Care Act on employment and work hours would be roughly 12 times as great as the effect of the Massachusetts law . That doesn’t by itself tell us the exact impact of the national law because we don’t have a precise estimate of the impact in Massachusetts , except that it was small . For example , if the Massachusetts law reduced employment by 0.1 percent , the Affordable Care Act’s effect would be roughly 1.2 percent ; not small . If the Massachusetts law’s effect were 0.25 percent ( still small ) , the Affordable Care Act’s effect would be 3 percent : again , not small . The bottom line was that it was wrong to expect the two laws to have had the same effects .Call me gloomy , but I’m one economist who thinks that adding , on average , five percentage points to marginal tax rates will noticeably depress the labor market , while adding a few tenths of a point in Massachusetts did not .
Conservatives like to say that their position is all about economic freedom , and hence making governmentâs role in general , and government spending in particular , as small as possible . And no doubt there are individual conservatives who really have such idealistic motives .When it comes to conservatives with actual power , however , thereâs an alternative , more cynical view of their motivations â namely , that itâs all about comforting the comfortable and afflicting the afflicted , about giving more to those who already have a lot . And if you want a strong piece of evidence in favor of that cynical view , look at the current state of play over Medicaid .Some background : Medicaid , which provides health insurance to lower-income Americans , is a highly successful program thatâs about to get bigger , because an expansion of Medicaid is one key piece of the Affordable Care Act , a k a Obamacare .There is , however , a catch . Last yearâs Supreme Court decision upholding Obamacare also opened a loophole that lets states turn down the Medicaid expansion if they choose . And there has been a lot of tough talk from Republican governors about standing firm against the terrible , tyrannical notion of helping the uninsured .Now , in the end most states will probably go along with the expansion because of the huge financial incentives : the federal government will pay the full cost of the expansion for the first three years , and the additional spending will benefit hospitals and doctors as well as patients . Still , some of the states grudgingly allowing the federal government to help their neediest citizens are placing a condition on this aid , insisting that it must be run through private insurance companies . And that tells you a lot about what conservative politicians really want .Consider the case of Florida , whose governor , Rick Scott , made his personal fortune in the health industry . At one point , by the way , the company he built pleaded guilty to criminal charges , and paid $ 1.7 billion in fines related to Medicare fraud . Anyway , Mr. Scott got elected as a fierce opponent of Obamacare , and Florida participated in the suit asking the Supreme Court to declare the whole plan unconstitutional . Nonetheless , Mr. Scott recently shocked Tea Party activists by announcing his support for the Medicaid expansion .But his support came with a condition : he was willing to cover more of the uninsured only after receiving a waiver that would let him run Medicaid through private insurance companies . Now , why would he want to do that ?Donât tell me about free markets . This is all about spending taxpayer money , and the question is whether that money should be spent directly to help people or run through a set of private middlemen .And despite some feeble claims to the contrary , privatizing Medicaid will end up requiring more , not less , government spending , because thereâs overwhelming evidence that Medicaid is much cheaper than private insurance . Partly this reflects lower administrative costs , because Medicaid neither advertises nor spends money trying to avoid covering people . But a lot of it reflects the governmentâs bargaining power , its ability to prevent price gouging by hospitals , drug companies and other parts of the medical-industrial complex .For there is a lot of price-gouging in health care â a fact long known to health care economists but documented especially graphically in a recent article in Time magazine . As Steven Brill , the articleâs author , points out , individuals seeking health care can face incredible costs , and even large private insurance companies have limited ability to control profiteering by providers . Medicare does much better , and although Mr. Brill doesnât point this out , Medicaid â which has greater ability to say no â seems to do better still .You might ask why , in that case , much of Obamacare will run through private insurers . The answer is , raw political power . Letting the medical-industrial complex continue to get away with a lot of overcharging was , in effect , a price President Obama had to pay to get health reform passed . And since the reward was that tens of millions more Americans would gain insurance , it was a price worth paying .But why would you insist on privatizing a health program that is already public , and that does a much better job than the private sector of controlling costs ? The answer is pretty obvious : the flip side of higher taxpayer costs is higher medical-industry profits .So ignore all the talk about too much government spending and too much aid to moochers who donât deserve it . As long as the spending ends up lining the right pockets , and the undeserving beneficiaries of public largess are politically connected corporations , conservatives with actual power seem to like Big Government just fine .
Conservatives like to say that their position is all about economic freedom , and hence making governmentâs role in general , and government spending in particular , as small as possible . And no doubt there are individual conservatives who really have such idealistic motives .When it comes to conservatives with actual power , however , thereâs an alternative , more cynical view of their motivations â namely , that itâs all about comforting the comfortable and afflicting the afflicted , about giving more to those who already have a lot . And if you want a strong piece of evidence in favor of that cynical view , look at the current state of play over Medicaid .Some background : Medicaid , which provides health insurance to lower-income Americans , is a highly successful program thatâs about to get bigger , because an expansion of Medicaid is one key piece of the Affordable Care Act , a k a Obamacare .There is , however , a catch . Last yearâs Supreme Court decision upholding Obamacare also opened a loophole that lets states turn down the Medicaid expansion if they choose . And there has been a lot of tough talk from Republican governors about standing firm against the terrible , tyrannical notion of helping the uninsured .Now , in the end most states will probably go along with the expansion because of the huge financial incentives : the federal government will pay the full cost of the expansion for the first three years , and the additional spending will benefit hospitals and doctors as well as patients . Still , some of the states grudgingly allowing the federal government to help their neediest citizens are placing a condition on this aid , insisting that it must be run through private insurance companies . And that tells you a lot about what conservative politicians really want .Consider the case of Florida , whose governor , Rick Scott , made his personal fortune in the health industry . At one point , by the way , the company he built pleaded guilty to criminal charges , and paid $ 1.7 billion in fines related to Medicare fraud . Anyway , Mr. Scott got elected as a fierce opponent of Obamacare , and Florida participated in the suit asking the Supreme Court to declare the whole plan unconstitutional . Nonetheless , Mr. Scott recently shocked Tea Party activists by announcing his support for the Medicaid expansion .But his support came with a condition : he was willing to cover more of the uninsured only after receiving a waiver that would let him run Medicaid through private insurance companies . Now , why would he want to do that ?Donât tell me about free markets . This is all about spending taxpayer money , and the question is whether that money should be spent directly to help people or run through a set of private middlemen .And despite some feeble claims to the contrary , privatizing Medicaid will end up requiring more , not less , government spending , because thereâs overwhelming evidence that Medicaid is much cheaper than private insurance . Partly this reflects lower administrative costs , because Medicaid neither advertises nor spends money trying to avoid covering people . But a lot of it reflects the governmentâs bargaining power , its ability to prevent price gouging by hospitals , drug companies and other parts of the medical-industrial complex .For there is a lot of price-gouging in health care â a fact long known to health care economists but documented especially graphically in a recent article in Time magazine . As Steven Brill , the articleâs author , points out , individuals seeking health care can face incredible costs , and even large private insurance companies have limited ability to control profiteering by providers .

Criticism of the Affordable Care Act has been conspicuously absent in the midterm election campaign cycle , with President Obama’s handling of foreign policy and immigration easier targets to pin on Democrats .But on the anniversary of the botched rollout of HealthCare.gov , talk of “Obamacare” is buzzing again , with remembrances of the website’s early failures , complaints of canceled insurance plans and laments of broken promises:1 yr ago , Americans tried to enroll in the # Obamacare website , experiencing the failures of gov’t-run HC… # IASEN http : //t.co/IqlYMQCk8v— Joni Ernst ( @ joniernst ) 1 Oct 14Because of ObamaCare approximately 50,000 Americans will lose their health insurance by November . # BrokenPromises http : //t.co/yz6tGFXIDq— Pete Sessions ( @ PeteSessions ) 1 Oct 14# Obamacare launched 1 year ago today .

Since then , its just been more failures and broken promises .— Lynn Westmoreland ( @ RepWestmoreland ) 1 Oct 14The Obama administration said last week that HealthCare.gov was being redesigned so that 70 percent of consumers would be able to use shorter and simpler application forms . So far , 7.3 million people have bought private insurance through the exchanges , have paid their premiums and are still enrolled in the program .
DALLAS â Senator Ted Cruz , after two days of bedevilment over his birthplace and eligibility for the presidency , returned to form on Tuesday night with a rally here before the conservative faithful aimed at ginning up support to defund President Obamaâs health care overhaul .âYouâre here because now is the single best time we have to defund Obamacare , â Mr. Cruz said to raucous applause at a cavernous ballroom at the Hilton Anatole hotel . âThis is a fight we can win.âThe event was part of Heritage Action for Americaâs âDefund Obamacareâ tour , which began Monday in Fayetteville , Ark. , and will make stops in nine cities . But Mr. Cruz is only appearing at the Dallas rally , and he drew a standing ovation from a crowd of roughly a thousand people .The tour is timed to the expiration at the end of September of the continuing resolution that finances the government , and Mr. Cruz said Tuesday night that he would call on House members to approve âevery penny of the federal government , everything in its entirety , except Obamacare.ââWhat has to happen after that is weâve got to do something that conservatives havenât done in a long time , â he said . âWeâve got to stand up and win the argument.âSpeaking to reporters before the rally , Mr. Cruz , a Republican and the junior senator from Texas , said he did ânot want to shut down the government â I want to defund Obamacare.âJim DeMint , a former senator from South Carolina who is now the president of the Heritage Foundation , speaking to reporters before the event , echoed Mr. Cruzâs basic message . âThis could be one of the most destructive laws that has ever been imposed on the American people , and now is probably the last best chance we have to actually stop it , â he said .He praised Mr. Cruz for taking the lead in the fight , even when victory was hardly assured .âAll you have to do is mention Ted Cruzâs name in any forum â Â we did last night in Fayetteville â Â and the crowd is on their feet cheering , because they donât necessarily expect him to win , but they do appreciate someone willing to stand up to the status quo in Washington to do what he promised , â Mr. DeMint said .Mr. Cruz was interrupted several times by angry protesters , but he was unfazed , saying that he would be happy to âvisitâ with them later .He closed his remarks by reappropriating Mr. Obamaâs signature campaign refrain of âYes We Can.ââCan we stop the I.R.S . ? â he asked . âCan we mobilize grass-roots America ? And can we defund Obamacare ? ââYes , we can ! â came the eager reply , before Mr. Cruz concluded , âThat , my friends , is change we can believe in.âBut even in Dallas , Mr. Cruz could not escape questions stemming from a report in The Dallas Morning News on Monday that because he was born in Calgary , Alberta , he held both Canadian and American citizenship . He was forced before the rally to reiterate to reporters eager to discuss the matter that he had âbeen an American since birth.âOn Monday , Mr. Cruz â the child of an American mother and a Cuban-born father who moved to Texas from Canada when he was 4 â renounced his Canadian citizenship . âNothing against Canada , â he said . But as a United States senator , he added , âI believe I should be only an American.âIt may not be quite the same as printing up signs or fashioning a presidential campaign Web site , but the announcement was widely seen by analysts as another step leading to his entry in the 2016 Republican primary race .It is a novel episode in the annals of presidential politics . Looming over his prospects are questions about his eligibility to run , given his place of birth .Mr. Cruz , 42 , maintains that because his mother was born in Delaware , he is a natural-born citizen and has the constitutional right to serve as president , and few legal scholars believe his eligibility could be seriously challenged in court . But the issue has been raised before .Senator John McCain , Republican of Arizona , was born in the Panama Canal Zone to American parents and faced a few questions about his birthplace when he was his partyâs presidential nominee in 2008 .But it is because of Mr. Obama that Mr. Cruz is confronting not just a constitutional issue but also a political one .Suspicions about Mr. Obamaâs background have long flourished on the fringes of American politics , so much so that the so-called birthers who doubt he was born in Hawaii led the president to release his birth certificate in 2011 .Mr. Cruz , wanting to pre-empt any such questions about his own origins , released his own birth certificate â dated Dec. 22 , 1970 .Mr. Cruz may have had another motivation in releasing his birth certificate and renouncing his foreign ties : Canada is not particularly beloved by American conservatives .National Review , the conservative magazine , memorably ran a cover in 2007 depicting a group of Mounties with the headline âWimps ! â The article inside complained about the countryâs âwhiny and weak anti-Americanism.â
DALLAS — Republican Sen. Ted Cruz sounds increasingly like he 's made up his mind to run for president in 2016 , telling an influential gathering of conservative activists Saturday that `` we are part of a grassroots fire that is sweeping this country . ''`` I 'm convinced we 're going to win in 2014 , and 2016 is going to be even better , '' the Texas Republican said during a summit of Americans for Prosperity , the political arm of the billionaire GOP donors Charles and David Koch . `` And in the year 2017 , a Republican president in the Rose Garden is going to sign a bill repealing every word of Obamacare . ''Cruz joked about inviting President Barack Obama to the border to see where thousands of unaccompanied immigrant children have poured into the U.S . The president declined such an invitation from Texas Gov . Rick Perry .`` I figured out the only way there is a chance in heaven he might come , I 'm inviting him to come to a golf course , '' Cruz said .Cruz offered a way to deal with Islamic State militants in Iraq . `` ISIS says they want to go back and reject modernity , '' he said . `` Well , I think we should help them . We ought to bomb them back to the stone age . ''When the crowd of more than 3,000 at a hotel ballroom serenaded him with calls of `` Run Ted , Run ! '' he offered a quip : `` Oddly enough , that 's the same thing my wife , Heidi , says to me when I go to the gym . ''Cruz ignored direct questions about a presidential campaign when he met with reporters after the speech .He told the conservatives , `` Each of you are here because we are part of a grassroots fire that is sweeping this country '' and added : `` We are building an army . ''Two other possible 2016 presidential hopefuls , Perry and Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky , spoke to the summit on Friday .
DENVER — Republican congressman Cory Gardner defeated the Democratic incumbent in Colorado 's U.S. Senate race on Tuesday , handing Republicans a big win in a swing state where the Democratic governor was also narrowly trailing his challenger .Senator Mark Udall 's re-election had looked fairly safe until February , when Gardner , 40 , said he was leaving a secure seat in the U.S. House of Representatives to take on the first-term senator .`` We won this election because we asked Coloradans ... to look ahead to a future that is brighter , '' Gardner told jubilant supporters at Republican campaign headquarters .`` We can fix this nation 's problems together . ... What is happening in Washington is n't working and it has to stop . ''Democrats said their Republican rivals made Colorado `` Ground Zero '' in their battle for the U.S. Senate , and the 64-year-old Udall was seen as vulnerable because of his support for the Affordable Care Act , or Obamacare , which was highly unpopular in the state .As Republican supporters cheered when it became clear the party would win control of the U.S. Senate on Tuesday night , fire marshals had to ask some revelers to leave , saying the room at a suburban Denver hotel was too crowded .With 83 percent of precincts reporting , Gardner had 50.6 percent of the vote to Udall 's 44 percent , according to the state 's flagship newspaper , the Denver Post . The son of a tractor salesman from a conservative eastern Colorado farming district , Gardner won the newspaper 's endorsement last month .Udall , whose father once sought the Democratic presidential nomination and whose cousin is a Democratic senator from New Mexico , had followed a successful strategy used by Colorado Democrats in the past by putting women 's issues front and center .But his bid to paint Gardner as an extremist on abortion appeared to have backfired , with the Post calling it an `` obnoxious one-issue campaign '' that insulted voters .Udall said in a concession speech that serving in the Senate had been `` the greatest privilege of my life . ''Governor John Hickenlooper , a former Denver mayor and brew-pub magnate who has been spoken of as a possible Democratic vice presidential candidate in 2016 , was fighting to fend off a challenge from former Republican U.S. Representative Bob Beauprez .With 86 percent of precincts reporting , Beauprez led with 48.0 percent of votes to Hickenlooper 's 47.5 percent .Both candidates urged supporters to go home and get some rest as a trickle of results showed the governor narrowing the gap with his rival to just a few thousand votes .`` Do not lose heart . Get a little sleep , '' Hickenlooper said .The governor , who ran for a second term on Colorado 's strong economic performance under his watch , has faced controversies over a proposed school reform tax increase and stricter gun laws introduced after a movie theater shooting in a Denver suburb and the Sandy Hook school shooting in Connecticut .Beauprez , who lost a governor 's race eight years ago , has also criticized Hickenlooper 's backing for a renewable energy mandate , as well as a failed $ 950 million tax hike for education reform proposed by the state 's Democratic-led Legislature .( Additional reporting by Rick Wilking in Denver , and Anna Yukhananov and Susan Cornwell in Washington ; Editing by Doina Chiacu , Eric Walsh , Peter Cooney and Ken Wills )
DENVER — Republicans posted sweeping gains in state houses across the nation on Tuesday , taking control of the most state legislatures in nearly 100 years and approaching a record number of governors’ seats — a critical development at a time when most major policy has been coming out of states , rather than Washington .With final tallies still being compiled , the Republicans now control both houses of the legislatures of 29 states , the highest number since 1920 . By contrast , Democrats now control both chambers in just 11 states . The Republicans netted at least two governor’s seats — while holding off strong challenges from Democrats in places like Wisconsin and Florida — leaving the party with at least 31 governorships , the highest since 1998 .“It was a worst-case scenario for the Democrats , ” said Tim Storey , an elections analyst at the National Conference of State Legislatures . “Republican voters turned out better , were more enthusiastic , they just swamped the Democrats . The anti-Obama mood was too strong even for many Democratic candidates who were well funded and had run equally active campaigns . In the state legislatures , the Democrats were overwhelmed by the environment.”With the states acting as laboratories for legislation that can not advance in Washington , policy changes are likely on a variety of issues . “What they’re going to do now is move forward a Republican set of policies — lower taxes and a focus on job creation , ” Mr. Storey said . “It will be much harder to see expansions of Medicaid . And there may be fewer restrictions for gun owners.”The results suggested a backlash by voters to what had been a record-high number of states under the full control of a single party , at least when it came to Democrats . Going into the election , Democrats held both houses of the Legislature and the governor’s seat in 13 states ; that number has been reduced to seven , though a few legislative races are still being tallied .`` The voters have asked for divided government , ” said Bruce Rauner , the Republican governor-elect in Illinois — Mr. Obama’s home state , where Democrats had held sole control of the state capital for more than a decade . “For the first time in many years , we’ll have a Republican governor and a Democratic legislature.”In Minnesota , Gov . Mark Dayton , a Democrat , was re-elected , but Republicans took control of the state House , ending the Democrats’ two years of full control of the state capital . “I think what we probably learned is that Minnesotans believe that the Democrats overreached in the last two years — on taxes , on spending , and in other areas , ” said Kurt Daudt , who had been the Republicans’ minority leader in the House .Republicans lost the governor’s seat in Pennsylvania , a state that had been under single-party control before Tuesday . But they put two more states under their single-party rule . Republicans seized both houses in Nevada , the home state of Senator Harry Reid , the Senate Democratic leader , and a place that Democrats have viewed as moving in their direction . Brian Sandoval , the Republican governor , was easily re-elected . They also won the governorship in Arkansas , putting that state into the single-party control category .Republicans will go into next year holding full party control in at least 23 states , the same as this year , though they could end up with 24 , depending on whether they continue holding Alaska , where votes were still being tallied in the governor’s race . A rare bright spot for Democrats on an otherwise bleak night was that they kept Republicans from taking over chambers in Kentucky and Iowa .Republicans hailed the results as evidence of public support of an agenda , played out in states like Wisconsin , that included scaling back union pension plans and the political power of unions and trying to combat President Obama’s health care plan .“Obamacare was a big driver in many of these races , ” said Phil Cox , the executive director of the Republican Governors Association . “And that’s certainly going to be on the table.”On Tuesday afternoon , Pat Hickey , who has been the Republican minority leader in the Nevada Assembly , said his party now had “a historic opportunity as well as challenge to be able to implement some of the reforms and remedies that we’ve argued for many sessions , if not decades.”Mr. Hickey said the newly Republican-held capital might tackle education issues and a restructuring of the state tax system , as well as examine collective bargaining rules and pensions . “All of these things will be on the table , ” he said .In Minnesota , where Republicans took control of the state House , Paul Thissen , a Democrat who will no longer be speaker , said he expected the change would stall hopes Democrats had for the coming year , including the possibility of more spending on transportation and efforts to expand worker protections like paid parental leave .In another measure of the shift in power , Republicans are poised to control 67 to 69 legislative chambers , up from 59 before the election , according to officials in both parties .Matthew Walters , the president of the Republican State Leadership Committee , said that the historic high for legislative seats held by Republicans was 4,001 in 1928 , and that the high for chambers controlled was 64 in 1920 . “We are confident that once all the final recounts are done , that we will be at a new all-time Republican high for chambers and a new all-time high of Republican seats in state legislatures , ” he said .The showing in some ways echoed the Republican victories in the last midterm elections in 2010 , when Republicans also made significant gains in state houses . But Michael Sargeant , the executive director of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee , a group that tries to elect Democrats to state legislatures , said he was confident that the party would pick up many of the seats it lost in the 2016 presidential election , which is what happened in 2012 .“Don’t take this as if we were joyous , ” he said . “We are not at all . But we thought this could have been worse . We held the Iowa Senate . We held the Maine House . Those were big targets for Republicans.”In one sense , the Republican victories in state houses may prove to be less consequential than the ones of 2010 ; those legislatures were the ones that drew district lines as part of the nation’s reapportionment process , giving the party what has proved to be a big advantage in Congressional and some statehouse races that could last through 2020 .
DENVER — What was once a `` fly-over '' Senate race in Colorado has become one of the nation 's most closely watched contests , with a young Republican congressman who is leaving a safe seat in the U.S. House fiercely attacking Democratic incumbent Mark Udall .As mail-in ballots headed to post boxes across the state this week , Udall 's path to re-election appeared steeper after he failed to win the endorsement of the state 's flagship newspaper . Polls show a race that 's too close to call .`` It 's a toss-up . ... There 's no one single issue that defines the race , '' said Floyd Ciruli , a Denver-based independent pollster , adding that various polls show each candidate with a slight lead .A poll by SurveyUSA and the Denver Post released on Monday showed U.S. Representative Cory Gardner ahead of Udall , 45 percent to 43 percent .Democrats say Republicans have made politically purple Colorado ground zero in next month 's general election as they seek to wrest control of the U.S. Senate from Democrats .Udall , 64 , is seen as potentially vulnerable because of his support for the Affordable Care Act , known as Obamacare , and because his 40-year-old rival has strong name recognition .In a bombshell editorial on Friday , the traditionally liberal Denver Post backed Gardner , though it lauded Udall as `` a fine man with good intentions . ''It said Udall was not seen as a leader in Washington and complained his team spent a `` shocking amount of energy and money '' unfairly trying to persuade voters that Gardner wants to outlaw birth control .`` His obnoxious one-issue campaign is an insult to those he seeks to convince , '' the newspaper said .Udall , who is running for a second term , has followed a well-trod tactic of Colorado Democrats by putting women 's issues front and center . At a candidates ' debate last week , one of the moderators noted that some pundits have dubbed him `` Mark Uterus . ''`` If Congressman Gardner had n't built his entire political career on limiting women 's reproductive choices , we would n't be having this discussion today , '' Udall said , adding that more than half his ads have dealt with other issues .Gardner , who is campaigning as a moderate conservative , says it is outrageous to suggest he wants to ban birth control , including over-the-counter contraceptives .In the past , Gardner has backed `` personhood '' initiatives in Colorado , which defined a person as a human being from the point of conception . He says he has since changed his mind .TRACTOR SALESMAN 'S SONSo concerned are Democrats about Udall 's fate that President Barack Obama urged Colorado voters to consider the race as important as the 2008 presidential battle , in which Colorado helped put Obama in the White House .On Monday , former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton headlined a fundraiser for Udall in Denver , then posed for the cameras with the senator at the city 's newly refurbished Union Station .Democrats in the state can be vulnerable : Last year , voters recalled two Democratic state legislators who approved tighter gun laws introduced after shooting rampages there and in Connecticut . A third resigned after being targeted .Until early this year it appeared Udall would face a Tea Party favorite , Weld County District Attorney Ken Buck . But after Gardner , a two-term congressman , said he would give up his seat in February to mount a challenge , Buck bowed out , saying he would seek Gardner 's House seat . [ ID : nL1N0LW0I3 ]Gardner , who represented a conservative eastern Colorado farming district , is the son of a tractor salesman . His ads have hailed his co-sponsorship of a 2007 bill to help fund clean energy projects , though critics say the bill , which was repealed five years after passage , was badly worded and ineffective .His campaign has sounded increasingly confident since polls in September began showing him narrowly leading Udall .Gardner has mocked Udall for skipping a Denver fundraiser led by Obama in July ( Udall pleaded official duties in Washington ) . And in a much-talked-about TV spot , he took a jab at his rival 's influential family ties .`` He 's a nice guy who will never change the Senate , '' Gardner said . `` Eighteen years in politics , and he 's got two cousins who are senators too . ''Udall 's father , the late Morris `` Mo '' Udall , was a U.S. representative from Arizona who sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 1976 . A cousin , Tom Udall , is a Democratic senator from New Mexico , and a second cousin , Mike Lee , is a Republican senator from Utah .Figures released last week show Gardner out-raised Udall in the third quarter , $ 4.3 million to $ 4 million .`` Money is not the end-all , '' Ciruli said . `` But it does show that GOP donors think this is a winnable race .

DES MOINES , Iowa — Republican Senate candidate Joni Ernst has canceled a meeting with The Des Moines Register 's editorial board , saying her time was better spent campaigning in Iowa .Editors at the newspaper said Ernst 's campaign notified them Wednesday night that she would n't attend the Thursday meeting . Publisher Rick Green said he was disappointed .`` Undecided voters I talk to want Sen. Ernst to break through the rhetoric and cacophony of campaign ads about hogs , Obamacare and balanced budgets . It 's a time for sharing specifics , '' Green said in a statement .Ernst , a state lawmaker and lieutenant colonel in the Iowa National Guard , is locked in a tight race against Democratic U.S. Rep. Bruce Braley . She said she was focused on talking to voters .`` I have got a tight schedule , '' Ernst said before a campaign event Thursday . `` What I need to do is really reach out to undecided voters . So we decided we 're going to drive on and get out to those counties and make sure I 'm connecting with actual people one on one . ''Ernst spokeswoman Gretchen Hamel issued a statement saying the Register 's recent editorials make the newspaper 's position `` perfectly clear . '' The paper , which endorsed Ernst in the five-way Republican primary , has run several editorial pieces criticizing Ernst 's policy positions .Ernst has met with editors at Nebraska 's Omaha World-Herald , whose readership extends into western Iowa , and at the Sioux City Journal . The Cedar Rapids Gazette endorsed Braley on Sunday and wrote that Ernst did not find time to meet with their editorial board . Editors in the Quad Cities and Dubuque said they have thus far unsuccessfully sought meetings .Hamel said the campaign may still find time for the other papers .Braley 's spokesman says the congressman has accepted all editorial board invitations .
DES MOINES — After making a large crowd wait in the sun for almost an hour , Michele Bachmann spoke for just two minutes and 22 seconds at the Iowa state fair Friday afternoon .Even as Sarah Palin made her way through another part of the fair , being mobbed by reporters and fair goers , Mrs. Bachmann offered a few of her tried-and-true lines on the crowd .“We sent a signal all across the United States , ” she said of Thursday night’s debate , “and it’s this : with your help tomorrow at Ames , Iowa , we are going to make Barack Obama a one-term president.”In front of one of the largest crowds of any candidate this week , Mrs. Bachmann pledged to repeal “Obamacare” and asked the audience whether they got “the hope and the change you believe in ? Time for a real change ! ”Then she added : “This is where Barack Obama got his start . This is where he is going to come to his end , in Iowa ! ”There was no indication that Mrs. Bachmann and Ms. Palin crossed paths at the fair .

Dana Milbank has an interesting piece today , on two levels .He begins:When will the criticism of Obamacare finally end ?I’ve done some research on the question , and by my calculations , judging from current trends , this will happen approximately . . . never .He then goes on to compare Obamacare to the auto bailout , which at this point looks like a rousing success — but continues to be lambasted by the right , because it shouldn’t have worked , and therefore can’t have worked .It’s a clever and apt comparison . But it’s something else , too : Milbank may be funny , but he’s not Shrill ( TM ) . So when you see him asking how conservatives will react to Obamacare’s success , it’s a strong signal that the press is catching up to the reality that December is not October , and that the news — while there are still many troubles — is increasingly positive . Actually , so is Darrel Issa’s angry rebuke to a health care official : “You need to watch more Fox News.”One thing this says is that GOP expectations that Obamacare’s collapse will lead them to triumph are way off . More generally , current polling — which reflects press coverage over the past couple of months , not the months to comes — is probably a very bad guide to future attitudes .
Despite strong dislike of President Obama’s handling of health care , a majority of people in three Southern states – Kentucky , Louisiana and North Carolina – would rather that Congress improve his signature health care law than repeal and replace it , according to a New York Times Upshot/Kaiser Family Foundation poll .The poll also found that a majority of Kentucky residents – and a plurality in a fourth state , Arkansas — said they thought the health care marketplace in their state was working well , even as they expressed strong disapproval of the health care law . More than twice as many Kentuckians say their state exchange is working well than say it is not .The findings in the four states — all with political races that could tip the balance of power in the Senate — underscore the complex and often contradictory views of Mr. Obama’s principal domestic legislation four years after it became law .Most people still loathe the law . Questions about it may evoke associations with an unpopular president , the remoteness of Washington from ordinary Americans and extra costs in family budgets . But majorities say they do not want it taken away , even in states that lean Republican in presidential elections .And when it comes to how the law is working , people give it much higher marks in the state that runs its own exchange — Kentucky . Arkansas , which has a partnership exchange with the federal government , is also ranked more positively .One of the poll respondents , Bonnie Broome , who works as a project manager for AT & T in New Orleans , said that the law was “cumbersome , ” but that it seemed here to stay . “I’m a Republican , but I’m tired of them saying ‘Repeal , repeal , repeal , ' ” Ms. Broome , 53 , said in a follow-up interview . “They need to make it better.”The poll also highlighted problems with the federal government’s implementation of the law . In Louisiana and North Carolina , where the federal government operates the insurance marketplaces because state officials opted not to establish their own , people give them more negative marks .“Well , I went on the Internet and tried and tried and tried to enroll , and it wouldn’t let me through and I finally ended up calling , ” said Teddy Taylor , 45 , a truck driver in Wilkesboro , N.C .Debate over the law is expected to dominate the midterm elections . Attacks on the law are featuring prominently in campaigns across the country , and Republican lawmakers have continued to push for the law’s replacement . Mr. Obama cites the millions who have signed up for insurance as evidence of the law’s success .Opposition to the president runs deep in the four states . In Arkansas , for example , 64 percent of respondents said they disapproved of his handling of health care . Still , the poll revealed that 60 percent of people in North Carolina and 52 percent of people in Louisiana and Kentucky would rather the law be made better than taken away . In Arkansas , 48 percent were in favor of improvements and 46 percent for repealing the law and replacing it .National polls have identified the sentiment before , but the fact that it surfaced in four states that voted Republican in the last election underscored just how deeply it is held .Democrats in Congress have requested changes to the law , arguing that earlier major pieces of social legislation , like Medicare , underwent revisions . But Republicans , who control the House , have refused to allow fixes , pushing for repeal and replacement .Views fell along predictably partisan lines , with large shares of Republicans in all four states preferring repeal and replacement and most Democrats opting for improvements . Independents were much more evenly divided , and in North Carolina and Louisiana , majorities preferred improvements .Perhaps more surprising were views on Medicaid , the medical program for the poor that only about half the states expanded under the law . When asked what states should do about Medicaid , the respondents offered substantial support for expansion .In Arkansas , a majority backed it , while less than a quarter opted for what the state actually chose — a “private option” under which the state used federal money to purchase private insurance for the poor through the new health care marketplace . Even among Republicans in the state , half supported Medicaid expansion while 21 percent liked the private option . In Louisiana and North Carolina , more than half of people agreed that their state should expand Medicaid and use federal funding to cover most of the cost .While the health law has punched a hole in Mr. Obama’s approval rating , it does not seem to have substantially harmed the Democratic governors of Arkansas and Kentucky , who have approval rates of 65 percent and 55 percent respectively , though they backed the law . In contrast , their Republican counterparts in Louisiana and North Carolina are both at 41 percent approval .The law is complicated and the poll’s findings showed the continuing confusion about it , including in Louisiana and North Carolina , which did not take money from the federal government to promote it . Only about 44 percent of people in Louisiana knew that the law provides financial help to low-income people to purchase insurance .“I think what would make it better would be to make it easier to understand , ” said Shirley Bates , a Republican from Ringgold , La. , who is unemployed . “I live with my mother and we don’t have a computer and we just get what we hear on the TV and from talking to others.”It appears from the poll that the news media did not help much . A majority of respondents in all four states said media coverage of the law had focused on politics and controversies , instead of on how the law might impact people .Majorities in each state said the law had had no effect on them personally . Still , among those who said they had been touched by it , about twice as many said they had been hurt by the law as helped .Among those who said the law hurt had them , a majority in each state said it had increased their costs . About three in 10 people said they know someone who had lost coverage because of the law , and about a quarter in each state said they knew someone who had lost a job or had hours cut .“I was just shocked by how much the premium actually went up , ” said Jack Hutson , 43 , a disabled veteran from White Hall , Ark . But the outcome was not all bad : His brother got insurance through the law and has managed to get a hernia fixed .Interviews were conducted by landline and cellphone from April 8 to 15 among a total sample of 4,152 adults in the four states with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points in each state .
During college , Lauren Braun worked at a health clinic in Peru , where she spent an inordinate amount of time tracking down mothers in an effort to get them to bring their children in for vaccinations . The experience was frustrating , but through it Braun came up with a business plan : Make silicone bracelets that function as punch cards , to remind mothers about upcoming appointments . Back in the United States , she consulted with mentors and perfected the idea , but then , she set it aside after graduation , going to work for a large health-insurance company , taking a salary and benefits over the uncertain life of an entrepreneur .A year and a half later , she got word that her bracelet company , Alma Sana , might have a life after all : The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation had awarded her $ 100,000 to test the idea . Braun was O.K . with the 60 percent pay cut she would take by quitting her day job . But she did not want to lose her health insurance .Were it not for Obamacare , Braun , 25 , would be confronting a phenomenon that economists call “job lock” : when people stay in jobs they dislike , or don’t want , solely to keep their health coverage . A Harvard Business School study in 2008 estimated that 11 million workers are affected by this dilemma . Other studies show that when people don’t have to worry about health insurance , they are up to 25 percent more likely to change jobs . Obamacare was designed , in part , to fix this inefficiency in the labor market , and thanks to that association , job lock has become a political lightning rod .In a sense , Obamacare amounts to a massive transfer of risk . Under the old system , if you quit your job and couldn’t get health insurance , you courted financial ruin every time you did something as mundane as riding your bike or playing pickup basketball . Now that risk is distributed to everyone who buys health insurance ( including the government ) . Free of the massive financial risk of being alive , unemployed Americans can more easily take on risks associated with doing what they want to do .Though this is a good thing for people like Braun , it doesn’t look good for the labor force as a whole — at least on the surface . In February , the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the Affordable Care Act would reduce employment by the equivalent of 2.5 million full-time jobs . Opponents seized on this as evidence that Obamacare is a job killer . But that’s not what the C.B.O . meant . “The estimated reduction stems almost entirely from a net decline in the amount of labor that workers choose to supply , rather than from a net drop in businesses’ demand for labor , ” the report says . In other words , if people work less , it will be by choice .It may seem counterintuitive , but from an economics perspective , this is a good thing , because it encourages the labor force to allocate itself more efficiently . Older workers will finally be able to retire , leaving openings for younger workers . People will switch to jobs that better suit their talents . Parents will be able to spend more time with their families . Such changes don’t always make people wealthier , but they make people happier .“This is allowing people to not have to stay in overworked , dead-end jobs that are probably making them sicker , any longer than they need to , ” says John de Graaf , executive director of Take Back Your Time , an organization dedicated to reducing overwork . De Graaf says that people who work long hours with little control over their schedules are more likely to suffer ill health effects like heart disease . So increasing their choices , he says , “may save more money on health than the act itself.”The health care law does contain some perverse incentives , which might make some people less productive . Low-income workers , who stand to lose their insurance subsidies if they earn too much , might drop out of full-time jobs .Conservative critics of Obamacare have latched onto this , and have been quick to mock the very notion that workers are “locked” to their jobs . “You’re not being fired , ” tweeted David Burge , the conservative blogger and humorist . “You’re just being freed from the job lock that keeps you from stardom in interpretive dance.”But in reality , many Republicans have long talked about the need to liberate workers from job lock , and conservative arguments against the Affordable Care Act willfully ignore the fact that giving workers more freedom benefits a favorite constituency : Would-be entrepreneurs . These future innovators might just be chained to their corporate gigs , unable to boost the economy with small-business hiring . Access to health insurance outside of work should enable them to take the leap .James Bailey , a graduate student in economics at Temple University , came up with a clever way to test that theory : he looked at what happened to 19- to 25-year-olds when the Affordable Care Act made it possible for them to stay on their parents’ health insurance plans , beginning in 2010 . Those who got the coverage , he found , were two to three times more likely to go into business for themselves . And that increase was largely driven by women , who are generally more risk-averse than men .“Women are more sensitive to the safety net in general , ” says Sarah Hamersma , an economist at Syracuse University . She found that when states expanded Medicaid eligibility , single mothers who had insurance through their employers were more likely to change jobs . That was true even if they did not qualify for Medicaid , suggesting that just knowing the safety net was there encouraged them to take risks . If part of what causes the wage gap between men and women is that women seek jobs with greater flexibility ( and lower pay ) , then more self-employment might help fix that .Still , having the government equalize risk cuts both ways . With Alma Sana’s initial feasibility study complete , Lauren Braun is currently spending a few months in Germany , where the safety net is robust . Entrepreneurs there tell her they are envious of Americans . “There’s a lot fewer investors here , ” Braun says . In part , that’s because there’s less wealth , fewer millionaires and fewer angel investors ( or , in the case of her benefactor , the Gates Foundation , people with so much money they just give it away ) .Our economy needs risk-takers in order to grow . That’s why the government creates programs to mitigate risk . For example , insuring student loans softens the risk of investing in an education . The bankruptcy system lessens the risk of starting a business .When Braun got the grant to start Alma Sana , the Gates Foundation’s generosity might have been pointless had it not been possible for her to go on her parents’ health plan . Without that , she says : “I would have had to have gotten a different full-time job in addition to doing this , and that would have been really challenging . I’ve worked 12 hours a day from the beginning of this grant period.” Meanwhile , the bracelets , which cost just pennies to make , could save thousands of lives and millions of dollars in wasted vaccines — or her startup might fail entirely . That’s a gamble Braun chose to take .
During the run-up to this morning’s Supreme Court health care ruling , liberals insisted over and over again that a decision overturning Obamacare would represently a nakedly “political” move by the court’s conservatives , rather than a decision motivated by an honest , principled interpretation of the Constitution and the law . Which makes it ironic that — upon first reading , at least — Obamacare seems to have been saved by Chief Justice Roberts’s decision to put political considerations ahead of a straightforward reading of the health care bill .The four liberal justices determined that an individual mandate to purchase health insurance was a plausible extension of the Congress’s Commerce Clause power . Given the ever-expansive liberal view of federal power and the long-running liberal commitment to a “living , ” evolving Constitution , this was a perfectly principled decision . The conservative bloc , joined by Justice Kennedy , determined that such a mandate was an indefensible extension of that same power — and again , for all the liberal sturm und drang about “partisanship , ” given conservative premises about the Constitution and the limits it places on federal power this was an entirely plausible and principled view as well .Chief Justice Roberts , though , agreed with the conservatives on the merits of the Commerce Clause issue , but ruled that because the mandate — despite being explicitly described as a “penalty” — could be construed as a tax instead , it should be allowed to stand . He mustered constitutional rather than political arguments for this construal , of course — citing , for instance , a prior decision in which the Court stated that “every reasonable construction must be resorted to , in order to save a statute from unconstitutionality.” But to my admittedly non-expert eyes , Roberts’s attempt at a “reasonable construction” looks more like a re-construction , and his ruling reads as a decision made much , much more out of deference to the legislative and executive branches than out of a straightforward application of the Chief Justice’s views of the Constitution to the plain language of the statute .This will not be a popular view among conservatives today , but I think that such deference is a defensible way for a restraint-minded Supreme Court Justice to approach his role in our republic . Nonetheless , liberals who waxed hysterical about a politicized court need to reckon with the fact that the most “political” of all the opinions on the health care law was the one that ultimately upheld it .

ERWIN , N.C. — Eleven years after becoming a national TV sensation , Clay Aiken still attracts a crowd in central North Carolina . In an hour he could only get a block or so down the street during an old textile town 's fall festival while fans stopped to talk and take pictures .`` I ca n't believe you 're here ! '' exclaimed Suzanne Strickland , 23 , after she and her mother left their craft booth at Erwin Denim Days . `` I saw you watching 'American Idol ' ! ''Finishing second for Congress wo n't cut it for the 2003 runner-up on the Fox show that vaulted him to a singing career and another second-place finish on NBC 's `` Celebrity Apprentice . '' Rather , he would just be another Democratic candidate who failed to beat the odds on North Carolina 's congressional map since Republicans redrew it and shifted the delegation 's makeup to the right .While national Democratic groups have n't arrived with financial support , Aiken believes there 's a path to victory in the U-shaped 2nd District over Republican Rep. Renee Ellmers . He 's trying to attract independent and Republican voters who recall his appearances as a crooner , and he 's hoping to catch breaks on the waves of unhappiness with Republican state government and gridlocked Washington politics .`` People are very dissatisfied with Congress in general and getting absolutely nothing done , '' Aiken said in an interview . He said Ellmers , a nurse , is wrongly fixated on repealing President Barack Obama 's signature health care law , rather than fixing its problems . `` If after three or four years , you still have n't gotten anything done , then what are you getting paid for ? ''Ellmers , who like Aiken was a first-time candidate four years ago when she upset Democratic Rep. Bob Etheridge , is throwing political inexperience back at Aiken and suggesting he 's role-playing to win votes .`` He 's an entertainer . He 's an actor , '' Ellmers , 50 , said in an interview after addressing the Kiwanis Club in Apex earlier this month . `` He believes that he can change costume and get into character and speak to whichever group and win them over . ''Ellmers is surely favored in a district anchored by Fort Bragg , affluent suburbs west of Raleigh , retirees near the famous Pinehurst golf resort and solid red south of Greensboro . The 2011 redistricting made the district swing more Republican , as Mitt Romney received nearly 58 percent of the 2012 presidential vote there , according to an analysis by the business advocacy group the North Carolina Chamber .If the race were competitive , outside groups would be investing in Aiken 's candidacy , said North Carolina Chamber political director Nathan Babcock , but he expected they wo n't because they 've got more pressing races .Scott Falmlen , a longtime Democratic political consultant in Raleigh , believes there 's a recipe for Democratic success in the district and says Aiken is following it well . But Falmlen is n't willing to predict a victory . Aiken raised more than $ 1 million for his campaign since February , benefiting from Broadway and Los Angeles events along the way . He hired veteran strategists and scheduled a bus trip through the district in the campaign 's final three weeks . Ellmers , who has raised more than $ 1.8 million this cycle , is battling anti-incumbent sentiment .Aiken has `` presented himself as a very credible candidate and I think some people wondered whether that would be the case , '' said Falmlen , who is n't working with Aiken . `` He comes across as knowledgeable of the issues . ''During a Saturday in the 2nd District , Aiken , 35 , engaged well-wishers as they browsed jewelry and ate barbecue , stopping for photos and hugs . But he also discussed veterans ' medical care and Medicaid expansion . He gave stickers to GOP voters that read `` Republaiken , '' wordplay on his name and the opposition party .Ellmers `` has done absolutely nothing and I 'm ready for a change , '' said registered Republican Peter de Young , 67 , of Pinehurst , who met Aiken at a street fair in Cameron .Ellmers , who frequents cable news shows and heads the Republican Women 's Policy Committee , blames Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid for refusing to consider House legislation . `` I ca n't force the Senate to act , but the American people can , '' she said , suggesting they should turn the Senate majority Republican next month .Aiken has tried to distance himself from Obama , saying he disagrees with him on issues and believes several changes should be made to the president 's signature health care law . But during their lone televised debate , Ellmers contended that , in the end , `` you support Obamacare . ''Aiken is a gay man running in a largely conservative district . Among passers-by in Erwin , it was n't an issue . `` That 's his choice , that 's his life . It does n't affect me at all , '' said Susan Boggs , 38 , of Erwin .Aiken supports gay marriage while Ellmers does not , though she publicly opposed the 2012 constitutional amendment in North Carolina that banned gay marriage . Both said during their debate that the issue of same-sex marriage , which is being decided in federal courts across the country , is out of their hands .Aiken received almost 12 million votes nationwide while narrowly losing to `` Idol '' winner Ruben Studdard in 2003 . This year , he edged out a well-known local businessman in the Democratic primary . It may take the ardent support of local `` Claymates '' — Aiken 's fan base during his `` Idol '' run— to win the title of congressman .
Eduardo Porter is getting a lot of attention for his piece in today’s paper suggesting that what Republicans fear most is that Obamacare might succeed . He deserves it : it’s a very good piece . But I guess I’m surprised that so many people seem to find this a surprising and new insight . I thought it was obvious . Here’s a column I wrote back in July predicting more or less what is now happening , for exactly the reason Porter gives : GOP panic over the prospect of successful health reform .And let’s be clear : the health reform fight has always been about more than health reform . Liberals have long viewed health reform as the opening wedge , a sort of proof of concept , in a campaign to strengthen the US safety net and reduce income inequality ; that was basically what I was urging in Conscience of a Liberal , which gave its title to this blog .Conversely , the right has long opposed health reform for exactly the same reason : it might , in the public’s mind , legitimate further government intervention to increase economic security .But let’s also be clear that these positions are not symmetric . Liberals favored health reform both because it would work and because it might enhance their ability to push for other policies ; conservatives were and are determined to kill health reform even though it would work — in fact , precisely because it would work — because it might weaken the rest of their agenda . Basically , liberals wanted to do something good that would enlighten the public ; conservatives want to prevent something good because they want to keep voters in the dark .Now , if Obamacare turns out to be the dismal failure every Republican insists , at least publicly , it will be , it will redound to the right’s benefit . But that’s not going to happen , and the behavior of the GOP shows that at some level they know that’s not going to happen .So my plot is working , mwahahahaha . Although I didn’t consider the side effect — benefit or cost ? — that health reform would drive conservatives stark raving mad .
Enroll America is an organization with a big job : to find the uninsured around the country and persuade them to sign up for health insurance . It needs a good way to find them .The organization realized early that it would need a detailed picture of just who was uninsured in the country and where they lived . The model they built underlies the maps and demographic summaries in The Upshot’s article today on who was helped most by Obamacare . Enroll , which is financed by charitable foundations , health care companies and private individuals , enlisted the help of data professionals who worked in the Obama campaign’s get-out-the-vote effort . It partnered with the data group Civis Analytics , which has worked extensively with political campaigns to find potential voters and persuade them to vote for particular candidates .The group wanted to be ready for outreach efforts in 2013 before the major coverage expansion provisions of the Affordable Care Act went live in January of this year . It wanted to persuade people to sign up during the open enrollment period , which began last October .To start , it conducted a huge phone survey of 12,000 adults around the country who use cellphones and land lines , asking people 10 basic questions in either English or Spanish . Then it folded in publicly available data about those individuals and their communities , using commercial databases and statistics from the census . It considered about 500 variables ; the final model used a smaller number , 30 , that together made a strong prediction . The goal was to create a score for each person that reflected the odds that the person would be uninsured .Then Enroll started sharing the scores with its workers and partners working in local communities . It found that neighborhood data was more useful than individual scores . Outreach workers focused on groups at the ZIP code level . With door-to-door canvassing , it helps to pick the neighborhoods where the greatest number of door knocks will find a person who is uninsured . In addition to door-knocking , and mailing fliers , the organization and its partners also bought targeted advertising and pursued community-organizing activities , like educating members of the clergy in communities with a lot of churchgoing uninsured people .“We started using the model initially to try to get to people at an individual level , and there was a degree of accuracy there , ” said Gregg Ross , Enroll’s organizing director in North Carolina , one of 11 states where the group made a big push . “Once we started using it for this geographic targeting and coupling it with our knowledge of the communities , we were finding that upward of 80 percent of the people we contacted were uninsured.”Ross’s high hit rate mirrored that of other Enroll workers and volunteers , and is one of the signs that the model is accurate . If the model was sending them to neighborhoods where they were not finding many uninsured people , it might suggest a glitch in the data . Over all , Enroll’s data team said that , at the neighborhood level , their door knocks last year varied by only about one percentage point from what the model was predicting .Enroll then repeated the whole survey-and-model process this summer to capture 2014 numbers , though its survey group was smaller — about 8,000 people . Its objective was to measure its results — just how many people signed up in the places it was targeting with personal contact — and to help develop its strategy for the second year of open enrollment .Its efforts also provide a window into where the Affordable Care Act is having the biggest impact on the uninsured rate around the country . That was the part that was particularly interesting to The Upshot . For the 2014 model , the most powerful variable was someone’s 2013 uninsured score . But Enroll also examined 200 other variables and ended up with a model that included last year’s score and about 15 other facts about each person .One of the reasons the Enroll data is so fascinating is because , more than any other public data source , it gives us a much more rich and detailed picture of who has insurance and how that is changing .But that also means that it’s hard to check the Enroll data against other measurements for accuracy . It’s important to understand that a model like Enroll’s is different from simple observations of people’s personal characteristics and insurance status , like those measured by the Census Bureau . The census is working to capture this same type of detailed picture of insurance status and other demographic characteristics , but because of its huge sample size and careful process , its data is published slowly . A full picture of who had insurance in 2014 isn’t expected until September of next year . Enroll did crosscheck its 2013 findings against the 2012 census numbers and found sufficient overlap ; 2012 and 2013 were very similar years for the uninsured rate .The Enroll story is roughly consistent with several private surveys that have been published . Like large , random telephone surveys by Gallup and the Commonwealth Fund , Enroll measured a five-percentage-point drop in the uninsured rate between 2013 and 2014 , or a reduction of about 10 million people . But its uninsured rates in both years were slightly lower than those of the other groups .Enroll’s data team members said that they know the base file they used to make phone calls included fewer men , fewer Hispanics and fewer poor people than the census measures because those people were harder to find and survey . That undercounting may explain its lower uninsured numbers . Its state-level insurance rate changes were also roughly comparable to state-level survey results from Gallup , the only organization with 50-state numbers , though there are some discrepancies .The differences between the other surveys and Enroll’s numbers mean that there may be some inaccuracies in the Enroll model . It may also mean that there are inaccuracies in the private polls . But there’s no reason to think that Enroll’s numbers are deliberately biased . Though many of the people working on the model were advocates for President Obama and are supporters of the Affordable Care Act , their organization’s motivation is to find the most uninsured people to target , not to paint a particular portrait of how the law is performing .“If we built a systematic bias into it , we would literally be handicapping our own organization , ” said Matthew Saniie , Enroll’s analytics and data director . “That’s not smart : One great story versus handicapping the efforts of thousands of people across the country doesn’t balance itself out.”
Et tu , C.D.C . ?For years , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been the most trusted agency in the federal government . In 2003 , when Gallup did a survey to determine what the public thought of various federal agencies , the C.D.C . topped the list , with 66 percent of respondents describing it as “excellent” or “good.”Last year , a similar Gallup poll showed that the C.D.C . 's approval rating had dropped to 60 percent , which was still better than any other agency . The C.D.C . has seen the country through SARS and the swine flu virus . The general perception was not only that it did important , apolitical work , but that it was highly competent . “I used to call the C.D.C . the shining star of federal agencies , ” says Lawrence O. Gostin , a global health expert at Georgetown Law .And then came Ebola .The Ebola outbreak is not exactly enhancing the C.D.C . 's reputation for competence . At first , the agency reassured the public that American hospitals were ready to handle any Ebola cases that came their way . That has turned out not to be the case . When Thomas Eric Duncan was diagnosed with Ebola in Dallas , the C.D.C . did not immediately fly in an expert team — something that the C.D.C . director , Tom Frieden , now says it should have done . Most recently , the C.D.C . appears to have allowed one of the Dallas nurses who helped Duncan to take a flight from Ohio to Texas even though she had a slightly raised temperature . When it became clear that she had contracted the virus — the second nurse to do so — Frieden was forced to admit that letting her on the plane was a mistake .Meanwhile , Frieden , a highly respected public health expert , had to walk back some of his remarks . Congress — including Democrats — appears dismayed by the mistakes . Perhaps the biggest one the C.D.C . made was that its voluntary guidelines for treating Ebola patients were too lax . In The Times a few days ago , Donald G. McNeil quoted several experts saying the protocols established by the C.D.C . were , in the words of one , “absolutely irresponsible and dead wrong.” One important protocol is having a “site supervisor” watching for errors . The C.D.C . has now included that guideline .Are there extenuating circumstances ? To hear infectious disease specialists tell it , the answer is yes . Like all federal agencies , the C.D.C . saw significant cuts to its funding thanks to sequestration . Another expert , Marc Lipsitch of the Harvard School of Public Health , told me in an email that because the chances of Ebola being imported to the U.S. were considered low , preparing for it was not considered a good use of scarce public money . “The budget cuts , ” he wrote , “have directly reduced preparedness.”In addition , the C.D.C. , like many federal agencies , had its mission transformed after 9/11 . Julie Gerberding , an appointee of the Bush administration , changed its emphasis to bioterrorism and other potential security threats . “She also brought in efficiency experts who were anathema to scientists , ” says Laurie Garrett , a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations and the author of the seminal 1994 book , “The Coming Plague.” Morale plummeted , and many of its best scientists fled .Fair enough . But it is also true that the C.D.C . was too hubristic in its approach to Ebola , and the consequence is that its staff now looks like bumblers . “They never challenged their own assumptions , ” says Dr. Richard Wenzel , an infectious disease specialist at Virginia Commonwealth University . “This is an unforgiving virus , ” he added , “about which there is a lot we don’t know.” The C.D.C . 's unfortunate habit of saying things as if they were certainties only to have to acknowledge that its judgment was questionable , says Wenzel , “can cause people to lose faith in the public health system.”When you think about it , many of the Obama administration’s “scandals” have been failures of competence . The Secret Service let a man leap over the White House fence and get into the White House . The Veterans Health Administration covered up unconscionable delays in treating veterans . The error-ridden rollout of the Obamacare website was a nightmare for people trying to sign up for health insurance . The Republican right takes it as an article of faith that the national government can’t do anything right . Problems like these only help promote that idea .And now comes the C.D.C . — the most trusted agency in government — thrust in a role for which it was designed : advising us and protecting us from a potential contagion . With every new mistake , it becomes , in the public eye , just another federal agency that can’t get it right .
Ever since they emerged in the early 1800s , political parties have been a target of public scorn . But they have always had their defenders — a smaller , less influential camp that holds that parties are more beneficial than harmful because they play an essential role in mediating political disputes .The anti-party forces fitfully succeed in enacting laws and rules to restrain party organizations and bosses , including the adoption of referendum and recall procedures ; requirements that states pick delegates to the national conventions through primaries and caucuses ; bans on closed-door meetings ; the prohibition of legislative earmarks ; and legislation that restricts the size and source of contributions to the national political parties .The intensity of polarized politics at every level of government now puts the dispute over political parties at the center of a debate among office holders , political scientists , legal experts and partisan activists . Is it possible that strengthening the parties could lessen polarization ?The pro-party camp contends that many reforms have unintentionally fostered polarization : diminishing the clout of parties and party leaders undermines their role as a force for moderation and compromise .Nathaniel Persily , a professor of law at Stanford , is a proponent of strong , well-financed parties . Polarization , he wrote in an email to me , “is a cost of many of these good government reforms . It is almost an intended cost if you think about it.” Why ? Persily argues that the purpose ofIn “Strengthening Parties , ” a chapter in the forthcoming volume “Solutions to Political Polarization in America , ” Persily contends that in the case of campaign finance , “the good good-government reforms that have been tried have , if anything , made things worse.”The claim that reforms have made things worse is based on the interaction between the 2002 McCain-Feingold Act , which regulated campaign finance , and two 2010 court decisions , the Supreme Court ruling in Citizens United and the Court of Appeals for the D.C . Circuit decision Speechnow.org v. F.E.C .The McCain-Feingold Act prohibited political parties from accepting unlimited contributions from corporations , unions and rich people , which had come to be called “soft money.”The federal court decisions , in contrast , explicitly allowed independent political groups – including both super PACs and politically active nonprofits – to accept all forms of soft money .Pro-party advocates argue that McCain-Feingold in particular has undermined political parties , while court rulings have empowered donors and independent committees , many of whom have agendas more polarizing than those of the parties .At a Bipartisan Policy Center conference in Washington earlier this month organized to explore the current campaign finance situation , Ray La Raja , a political scientist at the University of Massachusetts , made a case , like Persily , in support of political parties:La Raja , who has been working with Brian F. Schaffner , another UMass political scientist , presented slides comparing states that limit contributions to political parties with states without such limits . In the states without limits , a much higher proportion of the total contributions to candidates , especially to centrist-moderate candidates , comes from the parties than it does in states with limits . In addition , the degree of ideological polarization between Republicans and Democrats in legislatures in states without limits is substantially lower than it is in states with limits , as Figure 1 demonstrates .Thomas E. Mann , a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who is a strong supporter of McCain-Feingold , disagrees with Persily and La Raja . At the conference , and in later email exchanges , Mann made a number of key points .First of all , Mann contends , Republicans are the driving force behind polarization . Their opposition to Democratic proposals is based less on ideological principle than on a strategic political decision to oppose President Obama on every front , even when he takes a position previously advocated by conservatives . Examples of the latter include the individual mandate under Obamacare and end-of-life counseling .“Much of the acrimony and gridlock is not a consequence” of ideological issues or campaign finance , Mann told participants at the conference . Instead , he argues , “it’s strategic – it’s all about capturing a majority in the House and Senate , and the White House.”According to Mann,Michael Barber , a political scientist at Brigham Young University who supports strong political parties , provided evidence to the conference that altering campaign finance laws has significant costs and benefits — trade-offs in every direction .Barber presented slides that showed that individual contributors to candidates are strikingly ideological and partisan , thus fueling polarization . That is , contributions from traditional PACs , which give relatively small amounts directly to candidates , are focused on the goal of gaining access , and thus are far more politically centrist ( Figure 2 ) .In a working paper on the impact that campaign finance regulation has on state elected officials , Barber found that “legislators who raise more money from individuals are more likely to be ideologically extreme , ” while “higher limits on contributions from PACs yield more ideologically moderate legislators.”One interpretation of Barber’s findings is that a reduction in the number of contributions from individual donors , including small donors , would diminish ideological conflict . This would mean , in effect , abandoning the long-sought goal of increasing participation in the campaign finance process . Conversely , by this reasoning , advocates of increased participation by small donors will have to tolerate exacerbated polarization and gridlock if they are successful .I asked Barber in an email about these conflicts , and he wrote thatNot an attractive option for either side . Reformers and party loyalists both face what Persily describes as “a devil’s choice.”McCain-Feingold does appear to have contributed to a decline in Republican Party fund-raising , and to the end of rising cash totals for Democratic Party committees . According to the Campaign Finance Institute , Democratic Party fund-raising grew from $ 229.8 million in 1992 to $ 626.5 million in 2000 , the last presidential election year in which soft money contributions were permitted . Since then , Democratic totals have remained virtually level , reaching $ 631.1 million in 2012 ( all these figures are adjusted for inflation ) .On the Republican side , the post-McCain-Feingold election years have produced a substantial decline in donations , which fell to $ 697.7 million in 2012 from $ 815.3 million in 2000 .But insofar as the parties are struggling , it is far more the result of court rulings that have led to an explosion of outside spending , which , in key battleground contests in the current election cycle , often eclipses spending by the parties .Experts who are at the heart of these developments argue that the courts over the past four years have tipped the balance in favor of independent political committees . Bob Bauer , a prominent Democratic campaign finance lawyer who spoke at the Washington conference , noted that “there are enormous differences between parties and outside groups , ” but the legal system now “privileges the groups.”The result is a distorted balance of financial and political power with the least accountable organizations gaining the most leverage over our campaigns . And yet , as we try to fix that problem and to address the general disrepute into which American politics has fallen , we have to think hard about how the unintended consequences of prior efforts at reform have helped to bring us where we are now .
Ever since they emerged in the early 1800s , political parties have been a target of public scorn . But they have always had their defenders — a smaller , less influential camp that holds that parties are more beneficial than harmful because they play an essential role in mediating political disputes .The anti-party forces fitfully succeed in enacting laws and rules to restrain party organizations and bosses , including the adoption of referendum and recall procedures ; requirements that states pick delegates to the national conventions through primaries and caucuses ; bans on closed-door meetings ; the prohibition of legislative earmarks ; and legislation that restricts the size and source of contributions to the national political parties .The intensity of polarized politics at every level of government now puts the dispute over political parties at the center of a debate among office holders , political scientists , legal experts and partisan activists .

Ezra Klein is puzzled ( or at least says he is ; I suspect he understands it perfectly ) by Republican hypocrisy on health care . For many years the GOP has advocated things that are supposed to bring the magic of the marketplace and individual incentives to health care : higher deductibles to give people “skin in the game” , competition among private insurers via exchanges — competition that would include reducing costs by limiting networks — and , of course , for cuts in Medicare . Now the GOP complains bitterly that some Obamacare policies have high deductibles , that it relies on the horror of exchanges , that some networks are limited , and that there are cuts in Medicare .Klein suggests that Republicans are really upset by other aspects of Obamacare , but are going after the easy targets even though they’re attacking their own ideas . In a sense he’s right , but as I said , I suspect that he knows that the issue is both bigger and simpler than he says .What underlies what Jonathan Chait calls the Heritage uncertainty principle ? He describes it thus:Conservative health-care-policy ideas reside in an uncertain state of quasi-existence . You can describe the policies in the abstract , sometimes even in detail , but any attempt to reproduce them in physical form will cause such proposals to disappear instantly . It’s not so much an issue of “hypocrisy , ” as Klein frames it , as a deeper metaphysical question of whether conservative health-care policies actually exist .The question should be posed to better-trained philosophical minds than my own . I would posit that conservative health-care policies do not exist in any real form . Call it the “Heritage Uncertainty Principle.”Well , actually it’s pretty simple . The purpose of most health care reform is to help the unfortunate — people with pre-existing conditions , people who don’t get insurance through their jobs , people who just don’t earn enough to afford insurance . Cost control is also part of the picture , but not the dominant part . And what we’re seeing right now , in any case , seems to confirm a point some of us have been making for a long time : controlling costs and expanding access are complementary targets , because you can’t sell things like cost-saving measures for Medicaid and limits on deductibility of premiums unless they’re part of a larger scheme to make the system fairer and more comprehensive .And here’s the thing : Republicans don’t want to help the unfortunate . They’ll propound health-care ideas that will , they claim , help those with preexisting conditions and so on — but those aren’t really proposals , they’re diversionary tactics designed to stall real health reform . Chait finds Newt Gingrich more or less explicitly admitting this .Hence the rage of the right . Here they were , with a whole raft of ideas they could throw out , like chaff thrown out to confuse enemy radar , to divert and confuse any attempt to actually provide insurance to the uninsured . And those dastardly Democrats have gone ahead and actually incorporated those ideas into real reform .Once you realize this , you also realize that people who warn that by opposing Obamacare Republicans are undermining their own proposals are missing the point . Yes , the Ryan plan to privatize Medicare looks a lot like Obamacare — but Ryan comes to Medicare not to save it , but to bury it , so the question of whether his plan could work is irrelevant .There’s no mystery here ; it’s just top-down class warfare as usual .
FOR the second time in four years , the Republican Party has won a sweeping midterm victory without having a policy agenda to match . The party has a more-than-comfortable House majority , a solid Senate edge , and it faces a lame-duck president sealed in a bubble of sour self-regard . But if you look for consensus on the ends to which this new power should be turned , you’ll find ... well ... um ... repeal of the medical-device tax ?The good news for Republicans is that they’re closer to having a positive agenda than they were in the backlash year of 2010 . Now , unlike then , actual flesh-and-blood Republican politicians have proposed substantial policy ideas on issues as diverse as health care and transportation , higher education and taxes , the safety net and sentencing reform . The party as a whole hasn’t rallied around these proposals , but they’re there and waiting to be taken up .The bad news for Republicans is that America’s permanent campaign is about to shift into a higher gear , because with the midterms over You Know What is coming next . This means that policy debates in Washington will soon be swallowed up by presidential insanity — and if the next Republican primary campaign is like the last one , the conservative conversation could soon become an idea-free zone .But there is reason to hope that this time might be different , that the 2016 primaries might feature not only actual ideas but a transformative debate . And that hope seems most likely to be realized if the primary field is winnowed early , and we end up with a contest that gives special prominence to Marco Rubio and Rand Paul .Rubio and Paul are not necessarily the most qualified of the Republican contenders — they are relatively young , they lack executive experience , and their legislative records are modest . But they are both deeply engaged with the challenges that would await a Republican president in a way that most of their potential rivals currently are not .Those rivals have either been out of national politics for a while ( Jeb Bush , Mike Huckabee ) , or they have been wrestling with state-level issues that don’t necessarily map onto national policy debates . There is , of course , plenty of time for Chris Christie or Scott Walker to raise his sights above pension fights and union battles . But Rubio and Paul are well ahead when it comes to thinking seriously about what a 21st-century conservatism should stand for and pursue .Seriously , and differently . Rubio has gone further than any other likely 2016 contender in embracing what’s been dubbed “reform conservatism” — a vision of domestic policy that would overhaul the tax code and safety net to support work , family and upward mobility . For the Florida senator , the details of that vision include tax reform that would expand the child tax credit , more substantial wage subsidies for childless adults , a Social Security reform that would open the program’s Thrift Savings Plan for federal employees to more Americans — and a reform of Obamacare ( still in the planning stages ) that would try to cover similar numbers with less-comprehensive coverage .Paul , meanwhile , embodies a more libertarian approach to conservative reform , in which the Republican Party would shed its “party of the rich” branding and reach out to new constituencies ( minority voters and millennials , especially ) by focusing on issues — criminal justice reform , civil liberties , corporate welfare — where a critique of big or heavy-handed government might be unexpectedly resonant .There is overlap between his vision and Rubio’s , particularly on combating crony capitalism . But there is also a real philosophical difference between the two men on how much government should do to address social problems .On foreign policy their contrast sharpens , because Paul casts himself as the heir to the realist tradition in Republican foreign policy , while Rubio’s record and statements are more in line with the neoconservatism of the Bush era . To use specific Obama-era examples , a Paul-led G.O.P . would presumably oppose Libya-style humanitarian interventions and eschew gambits like our effort to aid Syria’s rebels , while a Rubio-led G.O.P . might be willing to put American boots on the ground in both situations . These are not small differences , and they might be magnified in larger crises .This is the point in the column when I would normally signal , subtly or clumsily , whose vision I find more attractive over all . But the reality is that I’m divided . I admire Paul’s outreach to minority voters , and I was very skeptical of the immigration bill Rubio shepherded through the Senate last year . But I have agreed with practically every domestic policy stance the Florida senator has taken since , and his reform agenda seems more sensible on substance and more plausible as politics than Paul’s more stringent libertarianism .But then on foreign policy my sympathies reverse . Paul’s ties to his father’s more paranoid worldview are problematic , but the realism and restraint he’s championing seem wiser than the G.O.P.’s frequent interventionist tilt . To imagine Rubio as a successful foreign policy president , I have to imagine an administration in the mold of Ronald Reagan’s , where hawkish rhetoric coexists with deep caution about committing U.S. ground troops — and I think there’s reason to worry we’d get incaution and quagmire instead .I suspect that the Republican electorate would also have mixed sympathies ... and that is exactly why the party should want to see these men debate . Maybe that debate would end with one victorious and the other clearly vanquished ; maybe it would encourage a kind of partial synthesis , perhaps offered by a savvy rival like Christie . But however the debate turned out , it would involve exactly the issues the Republicans need to work through before they’re given control of the White House once again .One potential alternative to a Paul-Rubio tilt , meanwhile , is almost too grim to mention : a campaign in which neither man gets traction precisely because they’ve staked out too many positions , and instead the establishment money flows to a candidate ( Jeb , Christie , even Romney redivivus ) who plays it safe while Ted Cruz and Ben Carson and others have an empty scrum on the right to see who gets to finish second .Such a campaign , in addition to being deeply tedious , would set the Republican Party’s intellectual clock back to 2012 , with predictable results for the party in its inevitable collision with La Hillary .Whereas to move forward , to win and govern , the G.O.P . needs to figure out exactly what kind of party it should be — and that may only happen if its brightest senatorial stars battle in the open , with a presidential nomination as the prize .

FROM the moment the ink dried on March 23 , 2010 , Republicans said they intended to “repeal and replace” the Affordable Care Act . They have voted more than 40 times to wipe the law from the books . But Republicans have never gotten around to describing , in detail , the set of policies they believe should replace Obamacare . That is , until yesterday .After nearly four years , we finally have a Republican counterproposal : the Patient Choice , Affordability , Responsibility and Empowerment ( or Patient CARE ) Act .Senators Tom Coburn , Richard Burr and Orrin Hatch deserve credit for developing this plan . Putting together a proposal to reform the American health care system is hard and politically courageous . And while it is lacking in important details , this plan contains some interesting ideas that might have enabled bipartisan compromises had they been offered in 2009 , when I was a health care adviser to the Obama administration and the Affordable Care Act was being debated . For instance , the plan would shift many low-income adults from Medicaid to subsidized private insurance . There are some Democrats who could certainly have supported such a proposal , if it had been offered as part of a deal to enact a bipartisan bill .Despite all the heated rhetoric from Republicans about Obamacare laying ruin to America , the plan would actually keep some of the law’s key provisions . It would preserve some subsidies for lower-income people to buy private insurance , though it would change the way they are calculated . Those $ 700 billion worth of Medicare savings Mitt Romney denounced during the 2012 campaign ? Republicans would keep them . Allowing young adults to stay on their parents’ plan until age 26 ? Republicans would keep that , too . And the ban on lifetime insurance caps , so people with very expensive diseases don’t lose insurance ? Republicans wouldn’t touch it .But in other crucial ways , the Republican plan is different . First , Obamacare’s absolute ban on withholding coverage from people with pre-existing conditions would be rolled back . Those who remained continuously insured would stay protected , so they couldn’t be charged higher rates or be excluded entirely . But if their insurance lapsed , health insurance companies could charge more or refuse to cover them .Second , it would shrink the Medicaid expansion . Pregnant women , children and families below the poverty line would still be eligible , but childless adults would not . States would be given a fixed amount per person enrolled in Medicaid to reduce spending .Third , the Republicans would provide tax credits for people to buy insurance , but only for families earning up to $ 70,650 per year . ( The Affordable Care Act’s subsidies go to families earning up to $ 94,200 . ) And employees of large companies , even if those companies did not offer health insurance , would be exempt , regardless of income .The largest difference is in cost control . Currently , employer-sponsored health insurance is tax free ; the Republican plan would make employees pay income tax on at least 35 percent of what their company pays for their plan . The idea is to make patients pay more for their coverage , giving them an incentive to choose cheaper health insurance plans with more deductibles and co-payments , which , in turn , would encourage them to shop around for cheaper tests and treatments and forgo unnecessary ones .On a more individual level , this is what the Republican plan means : If you are one of the 150 million Americans who get their health insurance through an employer-sponsored plan , get ready for a big tax increase . For a family in the 28 percent tax bracket ( earning around $ 150,000 per year ) , according to my calculations , it would add up to about $ 1,470 per year .Here’s how you get that number : In 2013 , the average employer-sponsored insurance plan cost $ 16,351 for a family of four . On average , employers pay 72 percent of that premium , or $ 11,786 . The Republican plan taxes 35 percent of the employer contribution , meaning that an additional $ 4,125 would be counted as income and subject to both payroll and income taxes . So that family would pay about $ 1,154 in income taxes and $ 316 in payroll taxes — $ 1,470 per year . Obviously , people would pay even more if their health-insurance premium was higher , if they were in a higher tax bracket , or if their state had an income tax .People who don’t get insurance through their employer would also be likely to pay more . The Republican plan would provide the unemployed , people in the individual market and those working for small businesses that don’t provide health insurance a tax credit to buy private insurance . But the credit increases only by age , not by need — which means people with lower incomes would pay much more than they would under Obamacare . For example , under the Republican plan , a 30-year-old man living in New York City earning $ 35,000 a year would pay the full price of insurance , roughly $ 4,383 for a typical plan . Under Obamacare , he would pay $ 3,325 . A 30-year-old earning $ 25,000 would get a $ 1,560 tax credit and pay roughly $ 2,823 under the Republican plan , but pay only $ 1,728 under Obamacare .In addition , the proposed plan would take us back to the old days when insurance companies could charge women more than men for the same health plan . And older people would also be penalized . Under the Affordable Care Act , insurance companies are allowed to charge 64-year-olds only three times what they charge 21-year-olds . But the Republican plan allows insurance companies to charge 64-year-olds five times more . So a 64-year-old individual could pay as much as $ 21,900 for a plan that costs a 21-year-old only $ 4,380 .The plan would bring back many insurance company shenanigans . For instance , the decision to roll back the ban on excluding those with pre-existing conditions sounds O.K . in theory : “individuals moving from one health plan to another — regardless of whether it was in the individual , small group , or large employer markets — could not be medically underwritten , ” meaning charged higher premiums based on a disease , and “denied a plan based on a pre-existing condition if they were continuously enrolled in a health plan.” So if you lose your job and therefore your employer-sponsored health insurance , you would not be excluded for a pre-existing condition if you immediately bought your own insurance . But if there were a gap in coverage , insurance companies could deny you coverage .What if the paperwork you filled out is “lost” ? The history of insurance companies’ tricks for denying coverage to high-cost patients — like revoking the insurance of a cancer patient who failed to disclose that she had back problems — does not inspire confidence .Finally , there is the issue of prevention . The Affordable Care Act made preventive services free . To save money , Republicans want to reverse that , so that Americans will behave like cost-conscious consumers — getting their blood tests at a cheaper laboratory or their CT scans at the cheaper imaging center . The problem is that mountains of evidence show that when patients have to pay , prevention is the first thing to go , in part because people aren’t suffering pain or other symptoms , and the benefits of preventive services are typically years away . Saving money by cutting back these services makes no economic sense in the long-term .There are many other problematic things the Republican plan does , like eliminate the health law’s taxes on health insurance , drug and device companies ; allow insurance companies to sell plans that don’t cover maternity , mental health or other types of care ; and allow insurance companies to impose annual limits on benefits .We finally got the “replace” part of the Republicans’ pledge to “repeal and replace” the Affordable Care Act . Now that Americans have the chance to examine the alternative , it might help them see the advantages of Obamacare .
For almost two months , the debacle of healthcare.gov allowed conservatives to live the life they always wanted . Health reform was a dismal failure ; Obama would go down in history as a laughingstock ; government can’t do anything ; viva Ayn Rand !Meanwhile , the technicians were working on what was always a technical IT problem , not a problem with the fundamental structure of the law . And while things are far from completely fixed , the crisis is clearly over . Obamacare will have millions of beneficiaries by the time open enrollment ends ; it will add many more in the 2015 cycle . Health reform is pretty much irreversible at this point . It’s even possible that memories of the initial botch will have faded enough by next November that Obamacare becomes a political plus in the midterms .That , at least , is how things look from where I sit . Apparently , however , many people on the right are still stuck on the notion that Obamacare is doomed , indeed that it’s collapsing as we speak . The latest version is the supposed “death spiral” of young people not signing up .As Ryan Cooper says , don’t count on it . There are lots of good reasons for the young to sign up , including the fact that it’s the law . And pay no attention to polls suggesting that the young are now down on the whole thing — those polls are colored by the IT mess of October-November , which is not where we are now .Still , that’s their line . And when you see a pundit making pronouncements on the state of affairs , you can get a good sense of his true political affiliations by where he comes out on this question . If a supposedly centrist pundit writes and talks as if Obamacare were in a doom loop , as opposed to the reality of ongoing recovery , you know which camp he’s really in .
For more than five hours sometime next March , nine Supreme Court justices will hear arguments on the constitutionality of the individual health care mandate that President Obama pushed through Congress in early 2010 .It will very likely be an excruciating five hours for Mitt Romney .The court’s move to hear the health care case next year — with a decision expected by June — will force a high-profile public debate over the individual mandate just as Mr. Romney may be trying to close out his battle for the Republican presidential nomination .For any other candidate in his position , that would be an opportunity to become the face of the Republican opposition to a health care law that the party has demonized . Representative Michele Bachmann , who has made vowing to repeal the law a pillar of her campaign , seized on it Monday .“I urge the court to strike down the law and rule it unconstitutional , ” she declared in a statement . “Furthermore , I call on President Obama and Congress to cease enforcement of the remaining provisions of Obamacare immediately until the Supreme Court rules on its constitutionality.”You can imagine if Mrs. Bachmann were the party’s nominee , she might be out there with a big anti-Obamacare sign , marching with protesters on the steps of the court building as the arguments are being made .Mr. Romney , by contrast , was silent on Monday , issuing no statements on the court’s announcement . A spokeswoman for his campaign did not respond to e-mails seeking comment on the issue .No issue has dogged Mr. Romney more throughout the presidential campaign than health care . His efforts to pass an individual mandate in Massachusetts while he was governor have been repeatedly used by his rivals — Republican and Democratic — to try to undermine his candidacy .So far , those efforts have failed to sidetrack Mr. Romney’s march to the Republican nomination ; he remains at the top of most surveys , nationally and in several of the important early states .And yet Mr. Romney’s history on the issue creates a lost opportunity for his party if they choose him to be their standard-bearer in the campaign for the White House against Mr. Obama . By championing his own similar proposal , Mr. Romney can only be so effective at making the case against Mr. Obama’s plan .That is not to say he has not tried . In several debates , and on the trail , Mr. Romney has adopted the “Obamacare must go” rhetoric of his rivals .“Obamacare is wrong , ” he said during the recent debate hosted by CNBC . “I’ll repeal it . I’ll get it done.”But if he becomes the nominee , he will take up that mantle after months of being hammered by the left and the right as a conflicted messenger on the subject .From the right , he has been criticized by his rivals for the nomination , who point to early editions of his book “No Apologies , ” in which he indicated that he believed the Massachusetts health care plan could be a model for the country . That notion was removed in later editions .Rick Santorum , the former senator from Pennsylvania , jabbed at Mr. Romney’s health care credentials in the same debate , stating that “I was always for having the government out of the health care business and for a bottom-up , consumer-driven health care , which is different than Governor Romney and some of the other people on this panel.”Mr. Obama’s campaign has been equally relentless in pointing out that the Mr. Romney’s plan in Massachusetts was an inspiration for the federal health care law that eventually passed .And Mr. Romney’s candidacy even inspired the creation of a group dedicated to pointing out supportive things he has said about individual mandates and other parts of Mr. Obama’s health care law . The idea ? To make it harder for Mr. Romney to criticize the law later .Eddie Vale , a spokesman for the group , called Protect Your Care , last week called it a “health care trap” for Republicans . He argued that the more the party stokes voter anger about health care , the more it is a “rebuke” to Mr. Romney .“If he is the nominee this is going to keep happening to them ad nauseam , ” Mr. Vale wrote in an e-mail to reporters .It is possible that Republicans could have the last laugh if they nominate Mr. Romney . Of all of the Republican candidates , he is the one most able to moderate his position on health care during a general election battle with Mr. Obama .If the court strikes down the health care law in June — just a couple of months before the Republican nominee gets formally selected at the national convention in Tampa , Fla. — Mr. Romney could make the argument to independents and disaffected Democrats that state-level plans , like the one he supported in Massachusetts , represents a better hope for actually getting something done on health care .But that would come along with a danger for Mr. Romney — that he is seen as once again changing his position on an important issue . His rhetoric opposing the law from the primary campaign will be hard to square with a more moderate position in the general election .And Mr. Obama’s campaign is certainly ready to accuse him of being a flip-flopper .

Fresh from his own re-election victory and his party’s powerful showing nationwide , Senator Mitch McConnell on Wednesday pledged to break the stalemate in Washington as newly empowered congressional Republicans moved quickly to demonstrate that they can get things done . “We’re going to pass legislation , ” Mr. McConnell said at a news conference in Louisville , Ky. “This gridlock and dysfunction can be ended.”Despite their new majority in the Senate and an expanded one in the House , Republicans face multiple difficulties , not the least of which are internal divisions . But they say they know they have to deliver or face a backlash in 2016 .“I think it really becomes important to appear to want to be a governing party rather than a complaining party , ” said Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri , a member of the party leadership . “My belief is we have about six months before the American people check that box one way or the other.”Anticipating for months that they would take the Senate and pad their majority in the House , Republicans have been quietly discussing their agenda and approach after regularly accusing Democrats , led by Senator Harry Reid of Nevada , the majority leader , of thwarting their priorities .They say they will focus on balancing the budget , restoring an orderly process for spending bills , revising if not repealing the health care law and enacting a major overhaul of the tax code — ambitious goals , given years of stalemate and discord .Before taking up the issue of immigration , Republicans are likely to see what unilateral action President Obama undertakes , and how the country reacts to it .Senate Republicans also intend to use their control of committees to bring new scrutiny to the White House , federal agencies and Mr. Obama’s expanding use of executive authority . Mr. McConnell , who will succeed Mr. Reid as majority leader when the new Congress convenes in January , has also promised wholesale changes in the way the Senate operates , including a five-day workweek , more floor debate and empowered committee chairmen .Republicans say they intend to force Mr. Obama to make choices on bills passed by the House that Senate Democrats have been able to keep from his desk , potentially touching off the president’s first extensive use of the veto after six years in office .Some Democrats who have been frustrated by the stalemate in the Senate say they are open to cooperating with Republicans .“Right now , we are helping destroy each other , ” said Senator Joe Manchin III , a centrist Democrat from West Virginia . “I would like to think we can work together . I’d like to get my amendments in debate.”In gaining control of the Senate , however , Republicans ousted some of the red-state Democrats most inclined to work with them , such as Senator Mark Pryor of Arkansas , reducing the number of potential Democratic allies .Other tensions may complicate their efforts . Mr. McConnell , with few votes to spare , will have to balance the views of a handful of more moderate Republicans , such as Senator Susan Collins of Maine , with those of unyielding conservatives such as Senator Ted Cruz of Texas , who following the election said Republicans should press their advantage as hard as possible .Mr. McConnell will also have to contend with the competing interests of Mr. Cruz and at least two other Republican senators expected to run for president — Rand Paul of Kentucky and Marco Rubio of Florida — and those of senators up for re-election in 2016 in swing states like Illinois , New Hampshire , Pennsylvania and Wisconsin .As for legislation , the party’s leaders in Congress are eying five major priorities:ENERGY Approving the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada could be fertile ground for agreement with Democrats who have differed with the White House on the issue . Combining the pipeline with new energy exports , expanded exploration and added efficiency could result in a bipartisan consensus on energy policy .On a conference call last week , Speaker John A. Boehner assured his members that he was “prepared to move quickly , along with Mitch McConnell , to make clear that the new Congress will be about jobs and the economy , ” according to an official familiar with the speaker’s remarks .“I’m talking about bills to green-light construction of the Keystone pipeline and increase exports of American-made liquefied natural gas ; to restore the 40-hour workweek for American workers that was undone by Obamacare ; to encourage American employers to hire more of our veterans , ” Mr. Boehner said , according to the official .BUDGET AND SPENDING Republican leaders in both the House and Senate say that reaching a deal on a budget will be crucial not only to prove that they can do it , but also to allow conservatives to put their imprint on a nonbinding fiscal plan .Senator Jeff Sessions , the conservative Alabama Republican who will lead the Budget Committee , has had his staff looking at federal spending for months to find places to cut in hopes of proposing a budget that would be balanced in as little as a decade . But despite wide sentiment among Republicans for cuts , a divide exists within the party .Some Republicans would like to reverse a series of Pentagon spending constraints put in place through earlier budget deals with Democrats , arguing that the military is being strained at a time when it is being required to fight the continuing threat of Islamic terrorism in the Middle East . Mr . Sessions has expressed reservations about easing the spending limits on the Pentagon , and doing so would make balancing the budget harder and require even more to be cut from politically sensitive social programs .But reaching a budget deal is also essential to putting in place a set of procedural shortcuts that would allow Republicans to force through changes in the health care law and a tax package on a simple majority vote , avoiding the threat of a Democratic filibuster .If they can enact a budget , Republicans hope to return to reviewing what traditionally have been 12 separate annual spending bills and reinvigorating a process that has all but collapsed by putting the bills on the floor and allowing senators to amend them .In March , for the first time since Mr. Obama took office , Republicans will also have to find a way to pass an increase in the debt limit as the majority party — a difficult task given that the debt limit has become such a lightning rod for conservatives who object to any increase in federal borrowing power . Mr. McConnell suggested on Wednesday that Republicans would address the debt limit in the budget .TAXES A sweeping overhaul of the entire tax code is another top priority for the new majority , one that at least in theory has some Democratic support . And much of the spadework has already been done — at the Treasury Department , the House Ways and Means Committee , which is likely to be led by Paul D. Ryan , Republican of Wisconsin , and the Senate Finance Committee , which will now have Senator Orrin G. Hatch , Republican of Utah , as its chairman . Mr. Hatch will replace Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon , a Democrat who is also a tax overhaul advocate and could be instrumental in the debate .The key to a deal will be the Obama administration . Treasury officials have already developed a detailed plan to simplify the corporate tax code and lower the corporate tax rate to 28 percent from 35 percent . Republicans want it closer to 25 percent and have repeatedly said any tax overhaul must include reductions in the individual tax rates , which apply to many small businesses . It looms as a difficult negotiation , but it is possible Mr. Obama could take a page from President Ronald Reagan , who worked with Democrats to pass the 1986 Tax Reform Act .HEALTH CARE It is a delicate topic , but top Republicans acknowledge they can not repeal the Affordable Care Act , particularly with Mr. Obama able to veto any such effort . They will no doubt take some repeal votes , but their initial focus could be on smaller changes .For instance , a medical device tax used to pay for the law is opposed by lawmakers from both parties who represent manufacturers , and a repeal of the tax could pass Congress . And another group of Republicans and Democrats has also called for returning the health law’s definition of full-time work to 40 hours from 30 , arguing that the lower limit is forcing too many people out of work because of employers’ efforts to comply with the law . Mr. Boehner singled out that measure as one that he would like to see advance .TRADE This is one area where the Obama administration and Republicans have a good chance of finding common ground . Republicans are enthusiastic advocates of increased trade , and the president is eager to get the added authority to negotiate new trade deals and win approval of a trade agreement with nations on the Pacific Rim . The main obstacle could be Democrats , many of whom are skeptical of trade deals that labor warns could cost American jobs . But a significant segment of Democrats back trade expansion , and a deal could probably be found if both congressional Republicans and the White House both press for it .Over all , those on both sides of the aisle agree that the change in Senate control presents a chance to curb the gridlock that has consumed Congress , but it also holds peril for Republicans if they fail to deliver .“They have a golden opportunity , ” Mr. Manchin , the Democratic senator from West Virginia , said . “If they get that and fail miserably , it is very bleak for them in 2016.”
Gov . Sean Parnell on Friday rejected calls to expand Medicaid in Alaska , citing cost concerns and prompting an outcry from critics who say the decision will leave thousands of Alaskans without care . Mr. Parnell , a Republican , said he believes a âcostly Medicaid expansion , especially on top of the broken Obamacare system , is a hot mess.â The governor faced pressure from health , advocacy and business organizations to expand Medicaid under the federal health care law . For states that do , on Jan. 1 the federal law will increase Medicaid eligibility to those making up to 138 percent of the federal poverty line , which in Alaska would be about $ 19,800 . The federal government is expected to cover the cost for the first three years , through 2016 , and the bulk of the cost indefinitely , with the states contributing . Studies have suggested that 26,000 to 40,000 people would have benefited .
Greg Sargent finds Marco Rubio trying to redefine the nature of budget blackmail , declaring that it’s not about Republicans threatening to shut down the government unless Obama defunds heath reform ; it’s about Obama threatening to shut down the government unless he gets to implement the law . No , really . Rubio:I think the real question is : Is Barack Obama willing to shut down the government over ObamaCare ? In essence , I think we should pay our military . I think we should fund the government . I just don’t think we should fund ObamaCare . And what the President is saying is we either fund ObamaCare or we don’t fund anything . And I think that’s an unreasonable position . And that’s the position he’s taken and the Democrats have taken .So , where have I heard that before ? In Lincoln’s Cooper Union address , in which he talks of slave interests declaring that they will break up the Union if Northerners vote in a Republican , which will make secession the fault of … anti-slavery forces:That is cool . A highwayman holds a pistol to my ear , and mutters through his teeth , “Stand and deliver , or I shall kill you , and then you will be a murderer ! ”Old Abe would have recognized today’s Republicans — and would probably have been saddened that this modern equivalent of the people he fought against bear the name , though none of the spirit , of his party .
HARRISBURG Pennsylvania ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama’s plan to extend health coverage to millions of poor Americans remains highly contentious , yet it is gaining momentum among several initially reluctant states where financial pragmatism is trumping ideology .Up to a dozen states , including several led by Republicans , could move forward with plans to expand coverage under Medicaid after the November elections . They take their cue from Pennsylvania and other states that have won Washington 's approval to add commercial innovations to the 50-year-old government program to make it more palatable to conservatives .Obama 's original idea of using tax money to expand Medicaid has long been a hot button for Republicans who portray the whole Obamacare healthcare overhaul as a form of socialism encroaching on American values of free enterprise and self-reliance . Texas Governor Rick Perry once said expanding Medicaid would be similar to `` adding a thousand people to the Titanic.”But two things have led to a change of heart for some Republican politicians .Most of the 27 states that are already expanding the program have begun to reap billions in federal subsidies for insurers , hospitals and healthcare providers , putting politicians elsewhere under intense pressure to follow suit .As demonstrated by Pennsylvania 's deal with Washington , the Obama administration has also proved willing to accept tweaks that give the private sector a greater role in providing healthcare and place new responsibilities on beneficiaries .All of that has got as many as nine states talking to the administration about potential expansion terms , with the possibility of up to three more joining the fray depending on November 's election outcomes . As a result , there could be even more pressure on Republican states that have opted out , providing critical mass for an initiative central to Obamacare .Heading into the final two years of his presidency , Obama wants to cement his legacy , a big part of which is his pledge to reduce the number of uninsured Americans .NEW WAVE“Pennsylvania’s the leading edge of what could be a new wave of expanding states , ” said Deborah Bachrach , a Medicaid expert at the law and consulting firm Manatt , Phelps & Phillips .“This would marginalize the non-expansion states to the considerable detriment of their citizens and put pressure on those who oppose expansion , ” she said .Some states with Republican governors , such as Indiana , are negotiating with Washington for agreements that could pass political muster with conservatives back home . Others such as North Carolina , South Dakota and Wyoming are exploring options .In Florida , Wisconsin and Maine , the outcome of the Nov. 4 election could bring a shift on Medicaid if Democrats win gubernatorial races there .Administration officials have said they are committed to working with all states to expand the scheme and noted that the number of the uninsured has declined much more in states that have expanded Medicaid coverage .A possible new wave of expansion comes as prospects for the broad Obamacare reform are also looking up . After a rocky start a year ago , research suggests that more than 10 million people have gained health coverage under the law .But that momentum could get lost if Republicans win control of the U.S. Senate and begin pressuring Obama to scale back the reform .Pennsylvania 's turbulent journey into the Medicaid fold offers a possible template for others , including the possibility of a political reversal if Republican Governor Tom Corbett loses his reelection bid . In polls , he is well behind Democratic challenger Tom Wolf , who favors expanding Medicaid and keeping its traditional structure intact .Corbett , who took part in a Supreme Court challenge to the Medicaid expansion , had opposed enlarging a government program without substantial change . A pro-Medicaid coalition of more than 100 groups responded with intense lobbying during the budget approval process in early 2013 .“We had advocacy days , drive-ins , invited lawmakers in to talk about what’s important , encouraged people to talk to their local chambers of commerce and organized educational opportunities , ” said Paula Bussard , policy chief at the Hospital & Healthsystem Association of Pennsylvania , which represents 250 institutions .A study by the RAND Corp predicted a $ 3 billion economic boost and the creation of 35,000 jobs – big advantages for a state that has struggled for decades to make up for jobs lost from the decline of the coal and steel industries.Corbett met in Washington with former U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius in April 2013 and a year of intensive talks followed .Pennsylvania won approval for only a handful of the two dozen innovations it sought , such as permission to offer benefits through private insurers and impose premium charges on beneficiaries who earn more than the federal poverty level .The program will also include incentives for beneficiaries to practice healthy behavior including screenings and set benefit packages according to commercial standards .Pennsylvania officials say that while a compromise proved possible , that did not mean convergence in political positions .“The administration comes from a different philosophical background , ” said Jennifer Branstetter , Corbett’s policy chief . “They want to make sure that the program’s there for everybody . And we want to make sure it’s there if you need it . ''Other Republican-led states hope the Obama administration will allow even greater flexibility .“The hope is that they 'll be less interested in the purity of their original vision and be more interested in cutting deals to get some of these things done , '' said Tony Venhuizen , spokesman for South Dakota’s Republican Governor Dennis Daugaard , who has been open to a Medicaid expansion .In some states , pro-expansion politicians are trying to win conservative support by pushing market-based innovations that over time could trim the cost of traditional Medicaid .`` Eventually , they could meld together , '' said Nebraska Senator Kathy Campbell , a Republican who has helped lead discussions with Washington .But while the turning tide on Medicaid bodes well for Obamacare , Republicans refuse to concede any points in the ideological battle around the healthcare model .( Reporting by David Morgan ; Editing by Caren Bohan and Tomasz Janowski )
HIAWASSEE , Ga. — Towns County , set in a spectacular corner of the Blue Ridge Mountains of north Georgia , is extremely rugged terrain for Democrats . The last Democratic president it supported was Jimmy Carter , and Mitt Romney won 79 percent of the vote two years ago . But last week Michelle Nunn , the Democratic candidate for Senate , drew an overflow crowd at a big park pavilion here and left it cheering . The effectiveness of her appeal has been one of this season’s biggest surprises .Ms. Nunn seems to have figured out that what Southern Democrats and centrists really want goes beyond specific policy demands . Her platform is the usual mix for a Southern Democrat , combining party-line liberalism — higher minimum wage , equal pay for women , universal pre-K , immigration reform — with more conservative promises like a balanced budget , building the Keystone XL pipeline and cutting regulations . But the core of her campaign message speaks to a yearning for a pre-Tea Party era when members of the two parties still talked to each other , bargained , compromised and managed to work things out with a minimum of vituperation .That era was never quite as cheerful or productive as it is now nostalgically depicted , and it is unlikely to reappear anytime soon . But its return has been conjured up as a real possibility by Ms. Nunn , in part because it is personified by her father , former Senator Sam Nunn , whose pro-military centrism is remembered with affection here .Mr. Nunn , looking trim and vigorous at 76 , campaigned with his daughter here , and she repeatedly invoked him as the inspiration for the kind of senator she hopes to be .“I carry the family values that I learned from my own father , ” she told the crowd , contrasting him with Senator Ted Cruz of Texas , who campaigned last week with her Republican opponent , David Perdue .“Ted Cruz ! ” she said , drawing immediate boos . “He’s the architect of shutting down the government . He’s a perfect example of the dysfunction in Washington , and we don’t need any more of that . What we need is people to come together and sit around tables like this and get things done that matter in the lives of people.”This pitch , delivered swiftly but with a light Georgia drawl , has kept her a few points ahead of Mr. Perdue in the polls in a very close race , and could reverse the long exile of Georgia Democrats from the Senate and major statewide office . She has been helped , too , by the nature of Mr. Perdue’s hyperpartisan campaign , which rests almost entirely on linking Ms. Nunn to the “failed presidency” of Barack Obama in every speech and most ads .“She supports Obamacare , ” Mr. Perdue said as a point of attack at a recent debate . But when he announced , immediately after winning the primary , that “I will prosecute the failed record of the last six years of Barack Obama , ” he gave Ms. Nunn a talking point she uses at every stop .“We have enough prosecutors in the other party , ” she said here . “What we could use is a few more problem-solvers.”Mr. Perdue’s biggest vulnerability is his record as a chief executive of several major companies . In a 2005 deposition that someone leaked to Politico this month , he admitted that he “spent most of his career” outsourcing . That essentially meant sending American jobs overseas to cut costs . The Nunn campaign put out a powerful ad featuring several of the nearly 8,000 workers who lost their jobs when Pillowtex , a North Carolina textile company that Mr. Perdue ran , went bankrupt while he walked away with $ 1.7 million .Ms. Nunn , by contrast , has run several nonprofit groups , most recently the Points of Light organization , which she frequently notes was founded by President George Bush .In an interview , she said she was convinced her background would help her find common ground with less partisan Republican senators like Johnny Isakson of Georgia and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee .But even moderate Republicans don’t run on promises to compromise with Democrats . If she becomes one of the rare Deep South Democrats in the Senate , she may find fewer hands reaching back across the aisle than she imagined .
HUNTERSVILLE , N.C. — The crowd that swamped a recent GOP candidates ' forum at a suburban Charlotte sports bar testified to Republicans ' hopes of defeating North Carolina 's first-term Democratic senator and moving closer to controlling the U.S. Senate .After years of voting Republican for presidents and Democratic for governors , North Carolina now rivals Ohio as a toss-up . No state plays a bigger role this year in whether Democrats will hold their Senate majority . And no Democratic senator has drawn more attack ads than Kay Hagan .She 's trying to stop a four-year Republican surge that turned North Carolina 's government sharply rightward and dealt President Barack Obama his only 2012 defeat in a fully contested state .As in many places , Republicans want to focus the campaign overwhelmingly on Obama and his health care overhaul . Without waiting for Republican voters to pick a nominee from a crowded field , a conservative group has spent nearly $ 6 million attacking Hagan for supporting the national health care law .`` This is the most toxic issue I 've seen in my political life , '' says Sen. Richard Burr , R-N.C. , who entered Congress 19 years ago . He predicts the health law — and Obama 's overall unpopularity — will sink Hagan , a lawyer and state legislator who seemingly came from nowhere to oust GOP Sen. Elizabeth Dole six years ago .Burr and many other well-established Republicans support Thom Tillis in the May 6 primary . He 's the North Carolina House speaker , and a corporate consultant from the Charlotte area .Battling Tillis , however , are feisty leaders of the tea party and conservative Christian movements . Sen. Rand Paul , R-Ky. , has endorsed one , and former Arkansas Gov . Mike Huckabee has endorsed the other .Tillis has more money and a better organization . But Democrats hope the others can hold him below 40 percent in the primary . That would force a runoff in which Tillis might be battered , and possibly beaten , by anti-establishment enthusiasm .`` You 've got the Republican civil war playing out right here , '' says Raleigh Democratic activist Thomas Mills . `` You 've got your tea partyers , your Christian conservatives and your bankers and country clubbers . ''After 20 years of enduring Democratic governors and a mostly Democratic legislature , North Carolina Republicans took total control of the government in the 2010 and 2012 elections . They poured pent-up energies into slashing taxes , spending and unemployment benefits , curbing Islamic `` sharia law '' and limiting abortion . Their new voting requirements — among the nation 's strictest — are most likely to affect poor and minority voters , who mainly vote Democratic .The changes shocked North Carolina liberals and many moderates accustomed to a more balanced brand of conservatism , notwithstanding Jesse Helms ' 30-year Senate career . North Carolina , they said , is n't South Carolina .Obama made southern history in 2008 , ending long GOP-win streaks in North Carolina and Virginia . Some people feel Hagan rode his coattails , but she won by a much larger margin .Virginia has kept narrowly trending Democratic . Democrats now hold the state 's governorship , state Senate and both U.S. Senate seats .North Carolina , however , shifted right again . After huge state GOP victories in 2010 , Mitt Romney bested Obama in 2012 . Republican Pat McCrory was easily elected governor when the Democratic incumbent did n't run .In North Carolina , `` 2008 was an aberration , '' said GOP consultant Marc Rotterman . `` North Carolina is a center-right state , '' he said , and most voters are content with the GOP-led legislature 's work .`` The problem for Hagan , '' Rotterman said , `` is Obamcare is an albatross around her neck . ''Like fellow Democratic senators in Arkansas and Louisiana , Hagan is trying to limit the law 's damage , including the discredited claim that almost everyone could keep insurance policies they liked . She says she quickly called for inquiries into the botched computer enrollments .Hagan says Republicans want to repeal the law without providing an alternative , letting insurers once again reject policy-seekers with pre-existing medical conditions . As for the attack ads , she said in an interview , billionaire conservatives from other states `` are trying to buy this election , '' which `` is not for sale . ''Establishment Republicans including prominent fundraiser Karl Rove see Tillis , 53 , as the sensible , pro-business type of conservative that North Carolinians like . But Democrats say Tillis is hardly distinguishable from his more openly ideological rivals .Tillis is following a front-runner 's strategy in the primary , focusing on raising money and skipping candidate forums .Both he and Hagan are cautious around reporters . In a 10-minute interview in his Raleigh office , Tillis said he thought the October federal government shutdown — triggered by House conservatives demanding more spending cuts — `` was well-intentioned but poorly executed . ''Tillis rejected Hagan 's complaints about a Republican-driven $ 500 million cut in state education spending . North Carolina 's GOP legislators inherited a large structural deficit , he said , and `` now we 're seeing the benefits of the tough decisions we made , '' in the form of job growth .In an earlier Associated Press interview , Tillis said he `` showcased the tea party and the principles as one of the things that we need to focus on '' when he became House speaker . As for his tea party and conservative Christian rivals , he said , `` to a large extent they 're talking about doing what we 've been doing . ''Such talk does n't satisfy tea party activist Greg Brannon , an obstetrician from Cary , N.C. , and Charlotte minister Mark Harris . They are Tillis ' top rivals for the nomination .They joined another contender , former Army nurse Heather Grant , at the Huntersville forum . It drew more than 100 people to a spot near Tillis ' home . An empty chair labeled `` Thom Tillis '' mocked his absence .Republicans taunt Hagan for sticking to Senate business in Washington when Obama recently visited Raleigh .Hagan declined to say whether she would campaign with Obama . However , she said , `` I welcome the president to come to North Carolina anytime . ''Republicans say they welcome him too .___Associated Press writer Gary Robertson in Raleigh contributed to this report .
Has anyone else noticed how much the GOP position on Obamacare resembles the classic borscht belt joke about the two ladies at a Catskills resort ? Lady # 1 : “The food here is so terrible , it’s inedible ! ” Lady # 2 : “And the portions are so small ! ” Republican # 1 : “Obamacare is slavery ! ” Republican # 2 : “And it’s so hard to sign up ! ”
Have you been following the news about Obamacare ? The Affordable Care Act has receded from the front page , but information about how it’s going keeps coming in — and almost all the news is good . Indeed , health reform has been on a roll ever since March , when it became clear that enrollment would surpass expectations despite the teething problems of the federal website .What’s interesting about this success story is that it has been accompanied at every step by cries of impending disaster . At this point , by my reckoning , the enemies of health reform are 0 for 6 . That is , they made at least six distinct predictions about how Obamacare would fail — every one of which turned out to be wrong .“To err is human , ” wrote Seneca . “To persist is diabolical.” Everyone makes incorrect predictions . But to be that consistently , grossly wrong takes special effort . So what’s this all about ?Many readers won’t be surprised by the answer : It’s about politics and ideology , not analysis . But while this observation isn’t particularly startling , it’s worth pointing out just how completely ideology has trumped evidence in the health policy debate .And I’m not just talking about the politicians ; I’m talking about the wonks . It’s remarkable how many supposed experts on health care made claims about Obamacare that were clearly unsupportable . For example , remember “rate shock” ? Last fall , when we got our first information about insurance premiums , conservative health care analysts raced to claim that consumers were facing a huge increase in their expenses . It was obvious , even at the time , that these claims were misleading ; we now know that the great majority of Americans buying insurance through the new exchanges are getting coverage quite cheaply .Or remember claims that young people wouldn’t sign up , so that Obamacare would experience a “death spiral” of surging costs and shrinking enrollment ? It’s not happening : a new survey by Gallup finds both that a lot of people have gained insurance through the program and that the age mix of the new enrollees looks pretty good .What was especially odd about the incessant predictions of health-reform disaster was that we already knew , or should have known , that a program along the lines of the Affordable Care Act was likely to work . Obamacare was closely modeled on Romneycare , which has been working in Massachusetts since 2006 , and it bears a strong family resemblance to successful systems abroad , for example in Switzerland . Why should the system have been unworkable for America ?But a firm conviction that the government can’t do anything useful — a dogmatic belief in public-sector incompetence — is now a central part of American conservatism , and the incompetence dogma has evidently made rational analysis of policy issues impossible .It wasn’t always thus . If you go back two decades , to the last great fight over health reform , conservatives seem to have been relatively clearheaded about the policy prospects , albeit deeply cynical . For example , William Kristol’s famous 1993 memo urging Republicans to kill the Clinton health plan warned explicitly that Clintoncare , if implemented , might well be perceived as successful , which would , in turn , “strike a punishing blow against Republican claims to defend the middle class by restraining government.” So it was crucial to make sure that reform never happened . In effect , Mr. Kristol was telling insiders that tales of government incompetence are something you peddle to voters to get them to support tax cuts and deregulation , not something you necessarily believe yourself .But that was before conservatives had fully retreated into their own intellectual universe . Fox News didn’t exist yet ; policy analysts at right-wing think tanks had often begun their careers in relatively nonpolitical jobs . It was still possible to entertain the notion that reality wasn’t what you wanted it to be .It’s different now . It’s hard to think of anyone on the American right who even considered the possibility that Obamacare might work , or at any rate who was willing to admit that possibility in public . Instead , even the supposed experts kept peddling improbable tales of looming disaster long after their chance of actually stopping health reform was past , and they peddled these tales not just to the rubes but to each other .And let’s be clear : While it has been funny watching the right-wing cling to its delusions about health reform , it’s also scary . After all , these people retain considerable ability to engage in policy mischief , and one of these days they may regain the White House . And you really , really don’t want people who reject facts they don’t like in that position . I mean , they might do unthinkable things , like starting a war for no good reason . Oh , wait .
Health care as a necessity comes only after food , shelter and income security . The mismanagement of the website HealthCare.gov and the cancellation of millions of policies pushes an underlying question out into the open : Is the federal government capable of managing the provision of a fundamental service through an extraordinarily complex system ?This system requires coordination of over 288 policy options ( an average of eight insurers are competing for business in 36 states ) , each with three or more levels of coverage , while simultaneously calculating beneficiary income , tax credit eligibility , subsidy levels , deductibles , not to mention protecting applicant privacy , insuring web security and managing a host of other data points .A malfunction at any one of these junctures could prove fatal .In enacting the Affordable Care Act , President Obama and his Democratic supporters in Congress took on the task of creating a set of information technologies that has to interconnect with the I.R.S . ; the Departments of Labor , Treasury , Veterans Affairs and Homeland Security ; the Social Security administration ; state governments ; insurers ; employers ; hospitals ; and practitioners in the private sector .Robert Charette , president of the ITABHI Corporation â a tech firm specializing in risk management â describes the problems:âHealthCare.gov is a huge system of systems and itâs extremely difficult to manage these things even in the best of times . Thatâs mostly because you have so many different interfaces with so many different assumptions controlling how the individual systems operate . And theyâre rarely built with enough flexibility to be used by lots of other systems . If you take a look at the IRS systems , the Department of Homeland Security systems , or any of the other ones weâre talking about , they were never created to be connected to something like HealthCare.gov.âThe seven million people officials initially estimated would sign up for the Obamacare insurance exchanges this year are putting their well-being and that of their families in the hands of government bureaucracies armed with demonstrably inadequate technological expertise.ÂThe chaos surrounding efforts to activate HealthCare.gov reinforces a key conservative meme : that whatever the test is , government will fail it . Insofar as voters experience their interaction with government as frustrating and unreliable , the brunt of political damage will hit Democrats , both as the party of government and as the party of Obamacare.ÂCumulatively , recent developments surrounding the rollout of Obamacare strengthen the most damaging conservative portrayals of liberalism and of big government â that on one hand government is too much a part of our lives , too invasive , too big , too scary , too regulatory , too in your face , and on the other hand it is incompetent , bureaucratic and expropriatory .In addition , the Affordable Care Act can be construed as a transfer of benefits from Medicare , which serves an overwhelmingly white population of the elderly â 77 percent of recipients are white â to Obamacare , which will serve a population that is 54.7 percent minority.Â Over 10 years , according to the Congressional Budget Office , the Affordable Care Act cuts $ 455 billion from the Medicare budget in order to help pay for Obamacare .Those who think that a critical mass of white voters has moved past its resistance to programs shifting tax dollars and other resources from the middle class to poorer minorities merely need to look at the election of 2010 , which demonstrated how readily this resistance can be used politically . The passage of the A.C.A . that year forced such issues to the fore , and Republicans swept the House and state houses across the country . The programâs current difficulties have the clear potential to replay events of 2010 in 2014 and possibly 2016 .The dysfunctional A.C.A . portal is not the only liability for Obamacare.ÂIn some states , insurance companies operating through new health care state exchanges are excluding key hospitals from coverage . In New Hampshire , for example , as Jonathan Weisman of The Times reported , there is one provider , Anthem Blue Cross , and it has excluded 10 of the stateâs 26 hospitals from participation in the companyâs coverage .Responding to an email , Drew Altman , the president and C.E.O . of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation , wrote of the A.C.A . :âI think the bottom line here is that the âwinnersâ greatly outnumber the âlosersâ in general and in the individual market in Obamacare , but the media and political math is different from the actual math . A significant minority of âlosersâ or self-perceived losers and a few high profile bad outcomes ( possibly NH ) are more than enough to cause real political problems.âÂAccording to Robert J. Blendon , a professor at Harvardâs School of Public Health , the New Hampshire type of problem is more endemic:âThis is the next big political story . The president promised people they could keep their doctor and implicitly their hospital . A number of state exchanges are like New Hampshire in that they are offering what are called narrow network plans . Some of these plans exclude coverage at childrenâs hospitals as well , which means some parents with sick children will have to change their source of care . This too is not what was promised.âIn the state of Washington , the Seattle Childrenâs Hospital was initially left off the list of approved care providers by five of the seven insurers operating in Kings County through the state exchange , Healthplanfinder . The hospital was forced to sue state officials in order to gain eligibility .Obama and his party 's elected officials not only have the elections of 2014 and 2016 to worry about , but also the future prospects of the liberal agenda writ large , which had appeared to be slowly gaining momentum before the Obamacare portal snafu .
Here’s a useful resource for tracking the history of the ideas embodied in the Affordable Care Act .The essence of Obamacare , as of Romneycare , is a three-legged stool of regulation and subsidies : community rating requiring insurers to make the same policies available to everyone regardless of health status ; an individual mandate , requiring everyone to purchase insurance , so that healthy people don’t opt out ; and subsidies to keep insurance affordable for those with lower incomes .The original Heritage plan from 1989 had all these features .These days , Heritage strives mightily to deny the obvious ; it picks at essentially minor differences between what it used to advocate and the plan Democrats actually passed , and tries to make them seem like a big deal . But this is disinformation . The essential features of the ACA — above all , the mandate — are ideas Republicans used to support .
Holy seven million , Batman ! The Affordable Care Act , a k a Obamacare , has made a stunning comeback from its shambolic start . As the March 31 deadline for 2014 coverage approached , there was a surge in applications at the “exchanges” — the special insurance marketplaces the law set up . And the original target of seven million signups , widely dismissed as unattainable , has been surpassed .But what does it mean ? That depends on whether you ask the law’s opponents or its supporters . You see , the opponents think that it means a lot , while the law’s supporters are being very cautious . And , in this one case , the enemies of health reform are right . This is a very big deal indeed .Of course , you don’t find many Obamacare opponents admitting outright that 7.1 million and counting signups is a huge victory for reform . But their reaction to the results — It’s a fraud ! They’re cooking the books ! — tells the tale . Conservative thinking and Republican political strategy were based entirely on the assumption that it would always be October , that Obamacare’s rollout would be an unremitting tale of disaster . They have no idea what to do now that it’s turning into a success story .So why are many reform supporters being diffident , telling us not to read too much into the figures ? Well , at a technical level they’re right : The precise number of signups doesn’t matter much for the functioning of the law , and there may still be many problems despite the March surge . But I’d argue that they’re missing the forest for the trees .The crucial thing to understand about the Affordable Care Act is that it’s a Rube Goldberg device , a complicated way to do something inherently simple . The biggest risk to reform has always been that the scheme would founder on its complexity . And now we know that this won’t happen .Remember , giving everyone health insurance doesn’t have to be hard ; you can just do it with a government-run program . Not only do many other advanced countries have “single-payer , ” government-provided health insurance , but we ourselves have such a program — Medicare — for older Americans . If it had been politically possible , extending Medicare to everyone would have been technically easy .But it wasn’t politically possible , for a couple of reasons . One was the power of the insurance industry , which couldn’t be cut out of the loop if you wanted health reform this decade . Another was the fact that the 170 million Americans receiving health insurance through employers are generally satisfied with their coverage , and any plan replacing that coverage with something new and unknown was a nonstarter .So health reform had to be run largely through private insurers , and be an add-on to the existing system rather than a complete replacement . And , as a result , it had to be somewhat complex .Now , the complexity shouldn’t be exaggerated : The basics of reform only take a few minutes to explain . And it has to be as complicated as it is . There’s a reason Republicans keep defaulting on their promise to propose an alternative to the Affordable Care Act : All the main elements of Obamacare , including the subsidies and the much-attacked individual mandate , are essential if you want to cover the uninsured .Nonetheless , the Obama administration created a system in which people don’t simply receive a letter from the federal government saying “Congratulations , you are now covered.” Instead , people must go online or make a phone call and choose from a number of options , in which the cost of insurance depends on a calculation that includes varying subsidies , and so on . It’s a system in which many things can go wrong ; the nightmare scenario has always been that conservatives would seize on technical problems to discredit health reform as a whole . And last fall that nightmare seemed to be coming true .But the nightmare is over . It has long been clear , to anyone willing to study the issue , that the overall structure of Obamacare made sense given the political constraints . Now we know that the technical details can be managed , too . This thing is going to work .And , yes , it’s also a big political victory for Democrats . They can point to a system that is already providing vital aid to millions of Americans , and Republicans — who were planning to run against a debacle — have nothing to offer in response . And I mean nothing . So far , not one of the supposed Obamacare horror stories featured in attack ads has stood up to scrutiny .So my advice to reform supporters is , go ahead and celebrate . Oh , and feel free to ridicule right-wingers who confidently predicted doom .Clearly , there’s a lot of work ahead , and we can count on the news media to play up every hitch and glitch as if it were an existential disaster . But Rube Goldberg has survived ; health reform has won .

How many Americans know how health reform is going ? For that matter , how many people in the news media are following the positive developments ?I suspect that the answer to the first question is “Not many , ” while the answer to the second is “Possibly even fewer , ” for reasons I’ll get to later . And if I’m right , it’s a remarkable thing — an immense policy success is improving the lives of millions of Americans , but it’s largely slipping under the radar .How is that possible ? Think relentless negativity without accountability . The Affordable Care Act has faced nonstop attacks from partisans and right-wing media , with mainstream news also tending to harp on the act’s troubles . Many of the attacks have involved predictions of disaster , none of which have come true . But absence of disaster doesn’t make a compelling headline , and the people who falsely predicted doom just keep coming back with dire new warnings .Consider , in particular , the impact of Obamacare on the number of Americans without health insurance . The initial debacle of the federal website produced much glee on the right and many negative reports from the mainstream press as well ; at the beginning of 2014 , many reports confidently asserted that first-year enrollments would fall far short of White House projections .Then came the remarkable late surge in enrollment . Did the pessimists face tough questions about why they got it so wrong ? Of course not . Instead , the same people just came out with a mix of conspiracy theories and new predictions of doom . The administration was “cooking the books , ” said Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming ; people who signed up wouldn’t actually pay their premiums , declared an array of “experts” ; more people were losing insurance than gaining it , declared Senator Ted Cruz of Texas .But the great majority of those who signed up did indeed pay up , and we now have multiple independent surveys — from Gallup , the Urban Institute and the Commonwealth Fund — all showing a sharp reduction in the number of uninsured Americans since last fall .I’ve been seeing some claims on the right that the dramatic reduction in the number of uninsured was caused by economic recovery , not health reform ( so now conservatives are praising the Obama economy ? ) . But that’s pretty lame , and also demonstrably wrong .For one thing , the decline is too sharp to be explained by what is at best a modest improvement in the employment picture . For another , that Urban Institute survey shows a striking difference between the experience in states that expanded Medicaid — which are also , in general , states that have done their best to make health care reform work — and those that refused to let the federal government cover their poor . Sure enough , the decline in uninsured residents has been three times as large in Medicaid-expansion states as in Medicaid-expansion rejecters . It’s not the economy ; it’s the policy , stupid .What about the cost ? Last year there were many claims about “rate shock” from soaring insurance premiums . But last month the Department of Health and Human Services reported that among those receiving federal subsidies — the great majority of those signing up — the average net premium was only $ 82 a month .Yes , there are losers from Obamacare . If you’re young , healthy , and affluent enough that you don’t qualify for a subsidy ( and don’t get insurance from your employer ) , your premium probably did rise . And if you’re rich enough to pay the extra taxes that finance those subsidies , you have taken a financial hit . But it’s telling that even reform’s opponents aren’t trying to highlight these stories . Instead , they keep looking for older , sicker , middle-class victims , and keep failing to find them .Oh , and according to Commonwealth , the overwhelming majority of the newly insured , including 74 percent of Republicans , are satisfied with their coverage .You might ask why , if health reform is going so well , it continues to poll badly . It’s crucial , I’d argue , to realize that Obamacare , by design , by and large doesn’t affect Americans who already have good insurance . As a result , many peoples’ views are shaped by the mainly negative coverage in the news media . Still , the latest tracking survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation shows that a rising number of Americans are hearing about reform from family and friends , which means that they’re starting to hear from the program’s beneficiaries .And as I suggested earlier , people in the media — especially elite pundits — may be the last to hear the good news , simply because they’re in a socioeconomic bracket in which people generally have good coverage .For the less fortunate , however , the Affordable Care Act has already made a big positive difference . The usual suspects will keep crying failure , but the truth is that health reform is — gasp ! — working .
Hungry for humor ? Jon Stewart served up his nightly dose of it last evening with a peek at the push for authenticity in the midterm election ads this cycle .His favorites were the gun fight between Senator Mitch McConnell and Alison Lundergan Grimes in Kentucky , the snowmobile wars in Alaska and , of course , Senator Mary Landrieu’s participation in a keg stand in Louisiana .Mr. Stewart suggested that the candidates might push the limits of absurdity a bit more , imagining ads that claim Mr. McConnell urinates sitting down or that show Ms. Landrieu promoting other types of intoxicants .“Come on , everyone , let’s party , ” Mr. Stewart chided . “The future of Obamacare hangs in the balance.”
I fairly often receive mail pleading with me to take a more even tone , to have a respectful discussion with people on the other side rather than calling them fools and knaves . And you know , I do when I can . But the truth is that on most of the big issues confronting us , there just isn’t anyone to have a serious discussion with . Ezra Klein offers a nice illustration of this point today , in his takedown of Avik Roy on Obamacare in California .The thing you want to bear in mind is that Roy is widely considered a good example of a reformist conservative , not to mention a health policy wonk . So what does this reform-minded wonk have to say about Obamacare ?Klein tries really hard to keep his temper even ; too hard , I think , because I wonder how many readers will stay with him all the way through . But to cut to the chase , Roy claims that Obamacare will cause soaring insurance rates , using a comparison that is completely fraudulent — and I say fraudulent , not wrong , because he is indeed enough of a policy wonk here to know that he is pulling a fast one .So here’s the comparison Roy uses : he points out that the insurance premiums that will apparently be charged on the California exchange will be higher than the lowest rates being offered by some insurers in California right now .As Klein says , this isn’t just comparing apples and oranges ; it’s comparing apples with oranges you can’t even buy .Right now , California has a basically unregulated individual market , in which insurers are free to reject whoever they choose , and charge whatever rates they choose . This means that a few young , healthy people with no record of prior medical problems can get cheap plans ; these are , of course , precisely the people who need insurance least , and these plans are cheap not just because they’re only available to the very healthy but because they don’t provide much insurance . If you’re not healthy or wealthy enough to get by with this kind of insurance , too bad .So looking at these rates tells you nothing at all about the success of a program that offers insurance to everyone , regardless of medical history , and sets fairly high minimum standards for the quality of that insurance .What’s more , this isn’t some obscure issue . When people try to explain the logic of ObamaRomneyCare — certainly when I try to explain it — they often start from precisely this point , pointing out that unregulated insurance markets give the healthy and wealthy a pretty good deal but leave everyone else out in the cold , then work from that point toward the “three-legged stool” of community rating , mandates , and subsidies that supports reform . So Roy has to know that he’s making an essentially fraudulent argument — and does it anyway .And Roy is about as good as you get in this stuff : his tone is even , he actually knows something . Nonetheless , he goes for the cheap , misleading shot .I know that a lot of people wish we lived in a country where debates about things like health care policy were serious , honest discussions of debatable points . I like to hope that by the time I retire I’ll actually live in a country like that . But right now , and surely for years to come , it’s basically facts versus fraud .
I haven’t been writing about the healthcare.gov thing , for the simple reason that I have nothing to say . What’s going on isn’t a policy question : we know from the states with working exchanges ( including California ) that the underlying structure of the law is workable . Instead , it’s about an implementation botch , which is an incredible mess , and reflects very badly on Obama . But the future of the reform depends not on policy per se but on whether the IT issues can be fixed well enough soon enough , a subject on which I have zero expertise .Of course , that hasn’t stopped other people from breathlessly commenting on every twist and turn in the polls , every meaningless vote in the House , and so on . Hey , it’s a living .But at this point there’s enough information coming in to make semi-educated guesses — and it looks to me as if this thing is probably going to stumble through to the finish line . State-run enrollments are mostly going pretty well ; Medicaid expansion is going very well ( and it’s expanding even in states that have rejected the expansion , because more people are learning they’re eligible . ) And healthcare.gov , while still pretty bad , is starting to look as if it will be good enough in a few weeks for large numbers of people to sign up , either through the exchanges or directly with insurers .If all this is right , by the time open enrollment ends in March , millions of previously uninsured Americans will in fact have received coverage under the law , and reform will be irreversible . Obama personally may never recover his reputation ; Democratic hopes of a wave election in 2014 are probably gone , although you never know . But anyone counting on Obamacare to collapse is probably making a very bad bet .
I know youâre worried about the government shutting down on Oct. 1. Who wouldnât be ? Services suspended , the nationâs credibility damaged in the eyes of the rest of the world . What serious person would want to let that happen ?Hehehehe .The better to plan your watchful worry , hereâs a tentative schedule of events:Monday , Sept. 23 : Senate goes into session to consider the House bill that couples funding for the government with defunding Obamacare .House is on vacation . Iâm serious .Wednesday , Sept. 25 : House comes back from vacation . Early . So stop carping .Thursday , Sept. 26 : Senate is working its way toward a vote on the bill . Whoops ! Somebody just objected to something . May take a little while longer .Friday , Sept. 27 : The House takes up a bill to raise the debt ceiling , thus allowing the government to continue paying its bills . Which is tied to defunding Obamacare , and construction of the Keystone XL pipeline .Saturday , Sept. 28 : The entire planet says : âKeystone pipeline ? âSunday , Sept. 29 : Maybe a day or two before , but around here â the Senate strips the Obamacare part from the bill funding the government , passes the bill and sends it back to the House .Sept. 30 : Last minute ! Clock is ticking !Oct. 1 : Best-case scenario â the House passes the bill in the wee small hours of the morning . Everyone breathes a sigh of relief and moves on to the question of whether the governmentâs ability to pay its debts should hinge on the construction of an oil pipe to the Gulf Coast .One thing at a time . About keeping the government running : In the end , itâll all be up to the House Republicans â pass a clean bill or dig in their heels and turn off the lights . âAt that point , House Republicans must stand firm , hold their ground , and continue to listen to the American people , â said Senator Ted Cruz of Texas .House leaders were less than thrilled with his advice . It was sort of like a guy who left the Alamo at the last minute , yelling âVictory or Death ! â as he galloped out of sight . Some people believe that Cruz is behind everything crazy going on in Washington right now . This is possibly true , if you work under the reasonable assumption that everything that happens in the world is based on a movie plot .THE CALGARIAN CANDIDATEDuring the Bush administration , agents of the Democratic Party hatch a long-term plot to ensure political ascendancy in the 21st century . Their secret tool : a Canadian-born Texas lawyer who they kidnap and brainwash . The mole â we will call him T. â suddenly emerges out of political obscurity in 2012 , propelled into the U.S. Senate by members of the Texas Republican Party who have also been secretly hypnotized by the Democratic operatives . The only sign of their transformation is a compulsion to say âT . is the kindest , bravest , warmest , most wonderful human being Iâve ever known in my lifeâ over and over again .By the next year , Democrats decide they want to force the Congressional Republicans to behave with breathtaking irresponsibility . Time to pull the trigger ! While T. is standing alone at a Washington costume party , he is approached by a beautiful woman dressed as the Second Amendment . And then ...Actually , the House Republicans have plenty of Tea Party patriots who are perfectly capable of being crazy all by themselves . Representative Ted Yoho of Florida told The Timesâs Ashley Parker and Jonathan Weisman that he was ready to stick to his guns : âIt only takes one with passion â look at Rosa Parks , Lech Walesa , Martin Luther King.âI am mentioning this partly because it isnât often you hear someone equate eliminating health insurance for the poor with Rosa Parks . Also because I like to write âRepresentative Ted Yoho.âThe bill the House sent to the Senate on Friday doesnât even make much sense . The âdefund Obamacareâ part looks as though it was written by squirrels . If it became law , Obamacare would actually continue to exist . At most , the administration would be crippled in their early efforts to get younger uninsured Americans to sign up for health coverage . ( This would presumably give the opposition more time to run those ads that show a young woman being given a pelvic exam by a monster Uncle Sam doll . ) And , meanwhile , the popular Childrenâs Health Insurance Program would be thrown into chaos , as well as payments to doctors who treat Medicare patients .But what the heck . No sacrifice is too great when the cause is convincing young adults that they shouldnât buy health coverage .Itâs an intense moment , even by current political standards . When the Republicans met in conference on Friday , Politico reported , Representative Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania compared John Boehner to Jesus : âI donât want this to be like Palm Sunday , where we bring the speaker in on a little donkey and then next Friday , we crucify him.âI know , Iâm having a hard time getting the image out of my mind , too .
I wrote yesterday about the remarkable way in which not just policies , not just policy ideas , but even the notion of who is a policy expert have been seemingly unaffected by the debacles of the past few years . Today John Taylor offers , unintentionally , a perfect example .Actually , before I get there , a word about self-styled conservative “market monetarists” : guys , have you noticed who your real policy enemies are ? People like me , Brad DeLong , etc . are skeptical about the Fed’s ability to offset the effects of fiscal austerity , but we do want it to try . The furious academic opposition to quantitative easing is instead coming from moderate conservative macroeconomists , notably Taylor and Feldstein . So your problem isn’t just that the GOP’s effective leader on economic issues gets his macro from Francisco D’Anconia ; it’s that even the not-so-silly wing of the party is dead set against what you consider reform .But back to Taylor today ; it’s another denunciation of quantitative easing . And while Taylor does cite Paul Volcker , who deserves immense respect for past achievements , his main source is … Allan Meltzer . This is the same Allan Meltzer who has been predicting runaway inflation for more than four years , who responded to the failure of any of that to materialize , not by considering the possibility that his analysis was wrong , but that there must be something strange going on . Why , it must be the fault of Obamacare !I don’t know what more Meltzer could have done to demonstrate that he has no idea how monetary policy works in a liquidity trap . Yet he hasn’t changed his views , still considers himself an expert , and is still treated as such .Incidentally , the Robert Samuelson article in which Meltzer blamed Obamacare for the failure of his inflation predictions also quotes Lorenzo Bini Smaghi at length . I happen to have been part of a group that , sometime in 2010 , received a long lecture from Bini Smaghi about how critics of the Greek plan were just ignorant , and failed to understand how well it was going to work . Ahem .
IN last weekâs column , I wrote about what might happen if the new health care lawâs Web site remained a festering technological sore for months to come . ( The answer : Nothing good . ) But itâs still more likely that HealthCare.gov will be fixed by Thanksgiving and millions of Americans will ( finally ) be able to get a real look at what Obamacare is selling them .What will they find ? One way to understand what is being offered is to think in terms of three âmores.â Insurance Ã la Obamacare will be more expensive , more subsidized and more comprehensive than what was previously available on the individual market .This may not be obvious if youâre struggling to log on to HealthCare.gov . But some of the state-level exchange Web sites are working well enough to enable illuminating window shopping .Take the exchange in my native state , Connecticut . There the âmore expensiveâ part of the new regime is readily apparent . If you look at Connecticut insurance prices for 2013 â that is , pre-Obamacare â on the online clearinghouse eHealthInsurance , monthly premiums for a 30-year-old in good health can start below $ 100 , and under $ 300 for a healthy 60-year-old .On the stateâs new Obamacare-compliant health care exchange , by contrast , nothing is that cheap . The lowest priced ( âbronzeâ ) plan for a 30-year-old Connecticut resident has premiums starting at $ 224 a month ; for a 60-year-old , the cheapest plan starts at $ 537 .These premium increases , however , donât tell the whole story , because there are subsidies , which the Connecticut exchange helpfully calculates as well . If our hypothetical 30-year-old makes $ 30,000 a year , for instance , he or she would be eligible for credits that lower the actual cost of the cheapest plan to $ 115 a month . A hypothetical 60-year-old making $ 30,000 would see the cost of the cheapest bronze plan fall to zero . Over all , the premium increases only really bite as subsidies phase out â at incomes above $ 45,000 , or about $ 62,000 for a family of four .They bite , in part , because insurance companies now have to take customers with pre-existing conditions , which drives everyoneâs rates up . But they also bite because buyers are getting more insurance than the older systemâs cheapest plans offered .Take those low-cost 2013 plans I mentioned above . A typical one â teased at $ 269 a month for a nonsmoking 60-year-old Connecticut man â comes with a $ 5,000 deductible , an annual out-of-pocket limit of $ 12,500 , and all kinds of copays and coverage restrictions .With some grandfathered exceptions , Obamacare makes those kinds of plans illegal . The out-of-pocket limit for individuals is capped at $ 6,500 a year , preventive services are fully covered , and various âessential benefitsâ as well .If we ever get beyond the follies of HealthCare.gov , the politics of the rollout will probably be defined by how ( and how vocally ) middle-class Americans just above the subsidy threshold react to this âpay more , get more , subsidize other peopleâ deal .Some of them will be buying for the first time , spurred by the mandateâs penalties ; many others will be shopping for a new plan because their previous ones no longer meet Obamacareâs requirements . Will they be grateful for more comprehensive coverage , even though itâs being forced on them and has higher premiums attached ? Or will they feel they were misled by the presidentâs âif you like your insurance plan , you will keep itâ rhetoric , and drive a further backlash against the law in 2014 and beyond ?Where the underlying policy debate is concerned , meanwhile , what you think about the three âmoresâ basically determines whether you belong on the left or on the right . To liberals , more is simply better , and the disappearing low-cost plans deserve to vanish , because they left purchasers potentially exposed to way too much financial risk . ( Even the new bronze plans are really too stingy in this view â which is probably why , if you qualify for subsidies , the Connecticut Web site deliberately nudges you toward the pricier silver plans . )Conservatives agree that these cheaper plans create more risk . But they also create a sensitivity to price â and with it , a curb on cost growth â thatâs rare in a system where third-party payment has made prices opaque , arbitrary and inflated . And for a society that pretty clearly spends far too much on health care , sticking with catastrophic coverage frees up money â thousands for individuals and families , billions for the government â to spend on something other than the insurance-medical complex .Yes , for some that money would ultimately get eaten up , and then some , by unexpected bills . But for others it might be money saved for retirement , money that pays for child care , money used to hire a contractor or buy a house . And for the public sector , it would be money for all the priorities â liberal as well as conservative â that are being undercut by rising health care costs .This is why the lawâs critics believe Obamacare might be a long-term failure even if it survives its launch troubles and works on its own terms for a while . Itâs not about the good things the reform delivers : those are real enough . Itâs about whether there are too many other goods , for too many people , that the lawâs three âmoresâ end up crowding out .
INDIAN ROCKS BEACH , Florida — The November midterm elections are more than eight months away , but a battle for an open congressional seat in Florida has become a high-stakes test of a crucial question for the fall : how the Republican assault on President Barack Obama 's healthcare overhaul will play at the polls .The race to succeed the late Republican Bill Young in a March 11 special election will not dramatically alter the balance of power in Congress , where Democrats face an uphill battle in November to gain the 17 seats they need to reclaim a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives .Even so , both parties and their big-money backers see the race on the Sunshine State 's Gulf Coast between Republican David Jolly and Democrat Alex Sink as a harbinger of the November 4 elections - a test of voter enthusiasm for campaign themes , ad messages and fundraising appeals .That is why voters in the St. Petersburg area have been bombarded in recent weeks by more than $ 5 million worth of television and radio ads , mailings and automated calls from the candidates and interest groups attacking or defending the healthcare law popularly known as Obamacare .Such spending is extraordinary for a special congressional contest in which the winner will have to run again in November , when the entire 435-seat House will be up for election .A victory by Sink , 65 , a former chief financial officer for the state who narrowly lost a bid for Florida governor in 2010 , could help reassure nervous Democrats that they will be able to neutralize Republican attacks on Obamacare this fall .Jolly , 41 , is a former aide to Young who has been a lobbyist for the past seven years . A win for him in the politically divided district , which Obama narrowly carried in the 2012 presidential election , would be a morale boost for Republicans and signal that their targeting of Obamacare is resonating with voters .`` We 're the testing ground this year , '' said Susan MacManus , a political science professor at the University of South Florida in Tampa . `` Both sides are watching very closely to see how their messages play with voters . ''With approval ratings for Obama and his healthcare law below 50 percent nationwide , Jolly and Republicans have tied Sink to the president and reminded voters of her support for Obamacare , a program designed to help millions of uninsured and underinsured Americans get private health coverage .Republicans say the program is too costly , kills jobs and robs many Americans of healthcare choices . Those arguments have been a constant theme in Republican ads against Sink .Jolly , who favors repealing the law , also has questioned Sink 's commitment to the district , which she moved into last year from neighboring Hillsborough County . Sink lost to Republican Rick Scott by 1 percentage point in the race for governor in 2010 , and Jolly has cast her as an ambitious politician with little interest in Pinellas County .`` Pinellas needs someone to look out for our interests , not President Obama 's , '' Jolly says in one campaign video .Another ad from the National Republican Congressional Committee features images of Sink , Obama and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi .`` Alex Sink 's loyalty is to them , not Florida , '' the narrator says . `` Why else would she continue to support Obamacare ? '''NOT A BILL YOUNG REPUBLICAN 'Sink has countered by attacking Jolly 's work as a lobbyist in Washington and linking him to the conservative Tea Party movement , labeling him an extremist who would threaten Social Security spending . That argument typically plays well in a state that is one of the United States ' retirement havens .Sink 's strategy reflects a tactic Democrats have signaled they will employ in the fall : emphasize the value of Obamacare and other social programs , and remind voters of Republican divisions between compromise-resistant Tea Party conservatives and the party 's more moderate establishment .Jolly calls himself a `` Bill Young Republican , '' invoking the name of the respected moderate who represented the area in Congress for 43 years until his death last year . Sink suggests his views are more in line with Tea Party candidates who she says are far right of America 's political mainstream .Sink , a former banker , also brushed off the idea she is new to the area and says she has done business there for decades . During a visit to a local retirement center , she told residents about working to open the first bank branch at the center .`` I 'm no stranger to Pinellas County , I 've been working here for 25 years , '' she said in an interview in her spartan headquarters in Clearwater . `` I can relate to the issues of seniors , protecting Social Security and Medicare . ''She has criticized Jolly for working as a lobbyist in Washington , including work he did for a client who favored privatizing Social Security . That issue could be key in next month 's election , in which analysts say nearly half of the voters are likely to be at or near retirement age .Jolly says he does not support privatization . `` She has completely fabricated this , '' he said of Sink , acknowledging that the ads against him have been `` effective but wrong . ''`` They spent a million dollars calling me a Washington lobbyist , and they went out and polled and realized they had wasted a million dollars calling me a lobbyist . So now she is playing the extremist card , '' Jolly said .GROUPS SPENDING MILLIONSOutside groups have rushed in to help both sides , spending $ 5.4 million so far . More than $ 3.4 million of that has been spent on Jolly 's behalf , according to figures compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics .The National Republican Congressional Committee has led the spending for Jolly with nearly $ 1.6 million . Other backers include groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , the National Rifle Association and American Crossroads , the group led by former George W. Bush aide Karl Rove .The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has led the charge for Sink , spending nearly $ 1 million on her behalf .The result has been a wave of campaign ads and mailings that has dismayed many residents .`` This local election has just been taken over by outside forces , '' said Kathy Krohn , a Clearwater geologist . `` I hope people still turn out to vote . ''Jolly acknowledged feeling guilty about the ad blitz while meeting with voters this week in Indian Rocks Beach near St. Petersburg . `` You 've seen the commercials . So I 'll start by saying I 'm David Jolly , and I apologize for one more message . '''WE CA N'T GO BACK 'Sink has fought back against Jolly 's Obamacare ads by saying she backed the initial effort to broaden access to healthcare and that any problems with the law should be fixed , rather than used to justify killing the entire law .`` We ca n't go back to where we were . It 's not perfect , so let 's fix it , '' Sink said of the law through which more than 3 million Americans so far have gotten health coverage .Jolly says he would replace Obamacare with measures that would preserve popular parts of the law , such as those preventing people with pre-existing medical conditions from being denied coverage and allowing children up to age 26 to stay on their parents ' health plans .A recent poll by the Tampa Bay Times newspaper found more than two-thirds of each candidates ' supporters said Obamacare was an important factor in determining their support .`` Sink is a very smart woman , but I 'm saddened that she wants Obamacare . It 's ruined our economy , '' said Barbara Koyutis , a real estate agent in Seminole . `` She is just doing what the Democrats want her to do . ''But Bettye Strickland of Largo , a retired state employee who favors Sink , said Obamacare has too many benefits to repeal it .`` She wants to fix what 's wrong with it , not destroy it , and that seems like a smarter approach , '' Strickland said , adding that `` I just tune all of the ( campaign ) ads out . You have to . ''( Editing by David Lindsey and Jonathan Oatis )
INDIANOLA Iowa ( Reuters ) - Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stoked speculation on Sunday that she was moving closer to announcing a bid for the White House in 2016 as she visited the early-voting state of Iowa to take part in the state 's annual `` steak fry , '' a gathering of Democratic activists that often attracts presidential hopefuls .After grilling steaks with her husband , former President Bill Clinton , Hillary Clinton delivered a populist speech to the crowd of more than 6,000 Democrats at a vast green field a few miles outside of Des Moines . She defended President Barack Obama 's signature healthcare initiative known as Obamacare , pushed legislation on a minimum wage and lambasted Republicans as `` guardians of gridlock . ''Clinton focused much of her speech on promoting Iowa 's Democratic candidates , including Senate hopeful Bruce Braley , who is vying in a closely watched race in the 2014 midterm elections on Nov. 4 .But she was coy as she parried questions about her intentions in 2016 .`` Too many people only get excited about presidential campaigns , '' she said . `` Look , I get excited about presidential campaigns . ''“We’re just here to support Democrats , ” Clinton added .Still , 2016 was in the air , particularly when Iowa Senator Tom Harkin , the host of the steak fry , referred to Clinton and her husband as `` the comeback couple '' and said `` there are many more chapters that will be written in the amazing life of Hillary Clinton . ''It was a reference to the nickname `` comeback kid '' used by the media to describe Bill Clinton 's rebound in his 1992 campaign from early setbacks .In 2008 , Hillary suffered an embarrassing defeat in the Iowa caucus , coming in third behind Barack Obama , who went on to win the presidency , and John Edwards .Sunday was Clinton 's first time back in the state since her defeat . `` It 's really great to be back , '' she said . `` Let 's not let another seven years go by . ''Clinton , whom many Democrats consider the frontrunner for the 2016 race , made a series of missteps this summer while promoting her memoir . Clinton said she and Bill were “dead broke” when they left the White House , a comment that was roundly criticized as suggesting she was out of touch with everyday voters .After a summer spent promoting her memoir across the world and relaxing in New York 's tony Hamptons , the steak fry event marked the kickoff to a series of events in which she will campaign and raise money for fellow Democrats for the 2014 midterms .

If House Republicans want to fray the Affordable Care Act on the eve of its implementation , defunding it won’t work . They’d be better off stripping or delaying the individual mandate .That’s the conclusion of two recent studies that speak to one of the many moving pieces in this fall’s vicious budget debate .House Republicans last week passed a bill that would keep on financing the federal government , but not the Affordable Care Act . Specifically , the bill orders : “Notwithstanding any other provision of law , no federal funds shall be made available to carry out any provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act” or a related law . It also retracts the “entitlement to benefits” — that is , the Medicaid expansion — in the law .If the Senate , with a Democratic majority , passed the bill from the Republican-controlled House as is , the law would be shot . There would be no federal money for the state exchanges , or to cover low-income adults in Medicaid . But there’s no way the Senate would pass the House bill . Even if it did , President Obama has vowed a veto .Rather , any defunding would be temporary , because of a government shutdown . On the day the exchanges were due to open , much of the federal government would go offline , including a big portion of the Health and Human Services Department that is running the coverage expansion . But legislative inaction can not gut Obamacare in the way that legislative action could . During a shutdown , implementation would “substantially” continue .That’s according to a Congressional Research Service report prepared for Senator Tom Coburn , an Oklahoma Republican . In no small part , the reason is that much of the Affordable Care Act’s financing comes from mandatory spending , rather than discretionary spending , and a continuing resolution concerns only the latter . Moreover , some of the law’s money comes from multiyear or “no-year” discretionary funds that do not get wrapped up in the continuing-resolution process either . The Health and Human Services Department says its reform implementation fund would not get touched by a lapse in appropriations .That is not to say that a shutdown , especially a long one , would not throw a wrench in health care reform or other programs financed with mandatory money . The Congressional Research Service report , for instance , looks at what happened to Medicare during the shutdowns in 1995 and 1996 . It continued to pay doctors and hospitals . But its financing for its claims-processing vendors came from the discretionary budget . During the shutdown , those vendors kept working with only the expectation that they would get paid later . And during a long shutdown , “claims payments might cease as vendors ran out of cash to cover their operating costs , ” the research service report says .Temporary defunding probably would not do much . But Congress could substantially mar the law by stripping or delaying the tax penalties on Americans who decline to buy insurance — the so-called “individual mandate.” And it is one tactic that Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio is mulling .A new Urban Institute study explains why . Using Congressional Budget Office figures , it shows that delaying the individual mandate for a year would reduce coverage by about 11 million people in 2014 . That would save the government some money . However , the effect on the health insurance marketplace might be profound . Many young and healthy people would decline to buy insurance coverage , with no penalty . The pool of the insured would be relatively sicker . Insurers would be forced to increase rates , as the healthy would do less to cross-subsidize the ill . Premiums would shoot up .Here’s the institute on the multibillion-dollar problems that might create:There is significant risk that low exchange enrollment in the first year due to the lack of a mandate could begin an adverse selection cycle which would make it difficult to establish viable risk pools in the exchange in future years . While the Urban Institute estimated that premiums without the mandate could be up to 24 percent higher than with the mandate , that analysis assumed fully effective risk adjustment across the exchange and nonexchange markets . Less effective risk adjustment could lead to even higher premiums in the exchange without the mandate and could dissuade insurers from participating in the new markets ; this could then further dissuade healthier individuals with current nongroup coverage from entering the exchanges , exacerbating the effect in the following years .In short , even a one-year delay in the mandate might cause cost problems throughout the insurance market — and from the perspective of the law’s supporters , that might be a lot worse than hassles related to a temporary shutdown .
If Republicans are in control of both houses of Congress next year — which is looking probable two weeks before the elections — House Speaker John A. Boehner and the Senate Republican leader , Mitch McConnell , could use some guidance from North Carolina : Don’t overreach .As of now , in a race that could go either way , the incumbent senator , Kay Hagan , a Democrat , is a slight favorite over the Republican Thom Tillis for one reason : The challenger is speaker of the state’s Republican-led House of Representatives , which is about as unpopular in North Carolina as Congress .The Hagan campaign calculates it offsets any national tide favoring Republicans by linking Mr. Tillis to the party’s rule in Raleigh , the state capital . The senator always refers to her opponent as Speaker Tillis , not Mr. Tillis , Thom Tillis or Tillis . That might be a credential in some states . Not North Carolina .Previously , Republicans were salivating over their prospects in the state . Mr. Tillis turned back right-wing primary challengers and was the strongest general-election candidate . Allies including the Koch brothers and Karl Rove’s group spent millions assailing , and presumably softening up , Ms. Hagan .But Mr. Tillis is haunted by the unpopular record of the Republicans who control state government . They slashed taxes , especially for the affluent ; cut social services ; prevented the expansion of Medicaid for poor people ; alienated women’s rights activists and enacted measures making it harder to vote that principally affected black and young voters .Republicans say Mr. Tillis has finally gotten his footing and is competitive , maybe even a point or two ahead ; private Democratic polling shows a steady advantage for Ms. Hagan of about three points .The Republican candidate passes up no opportunity to link Ms. Hagan to President Barack Obama , whose favorability in the state is about five points below his mediocre national rating . Obamacare , the scandal over substandard care for veterans and gridlock in Washington are portrayed as Obama-Hagan messes .Last week , the Tillis campaign was playing up the role of the president and the Democratic senator in the rise of Islamic State and the handling of a potential Ebola epidemic . “Senator Hagan has to be held accountable , ” Mr. Tillis said in an interview in Goldsboro . “She has not pounded the table at the Obama incompetence.”Similar criticism has been leveled at Democrats elsewhere . But Ms. Hagan has an advantage : She can use Mr. Tillis’s unpopular record as fodder for attacks by linking him to the state government’s decisions to defund Planned Parenthood , reject pay equity for women , refuse Medicaid expansion and cut voting opportunities . These issues energize the Democratic base , women and minorities . The conflict is most heated on the topic of education , a top issue this year in North Carolina . Mr. Tillis claims Democrats are falsely accusing him of cutting funding for schools , which he says has increased . Democrats say funding didn’t keep up with population growth and inflation , so the amount allotted was a reduction .This may be the most expensive race per voter in the United States , with a final tally , counting spending by outside groups , of as much as $ 100 million . With both sides flush , money probably won’t be a determining factor .What is critical for Ms. Hagan — Democrats must win this race to have a shot at retaining their Senate majority — is the so-called ground game : the voter identification and turnout effort . Democrats , who report they’ll have 10,000 volunteers , are optimistic , especially when it comes to the black community , agitated by Republican action in state government .Republicans say that victory depends on holding the libertarian candidate , a pizza deliveryman who drains more support from Mr. Tillis , to under 5 percent of the vote . Ultimately , though , this race will probably be decided by whether voters on Election Day are thinking about their distaste for Mr. Obama and Washington or their negative feelings about Republicans and Raleigh .
If only I’d checked with you first , Times readers , I could have expanded my list of fallacies about the Affordable Care Act . Thanks to your comments and emails on my column , I’ve noted a few more enduring myths that seem worthy of debunking . See below .But first , let me field a bit of incoming flak .An astute reader took issue with my statement that the law will “deliver 30 million new customers to the private insurance industry.” In fact , some of those 30 million will be poor enough to qualify for Medicaid , and will not end up in the private market . How many ? Because the same Supreme Court case that approved the mandate also allowed states to opt out of expanded Medicaid , it’s impossible to say . Estimates were that if the states had to participate , roughly half of the 30 million would qualify for Medicaid , but under the Supreme Court ruling the number is likely to be far fewer . ( We’re publishing a correction on the 30 million . ) But my point stands that the law , although it imposes new rules on insurers , is not a “federal takeover” of health insurance . For better or worse , it preserves our private insurance industry and requires that millions of additional customers buy their products .On the “job-killer” front , I heard from a number of small businessmen who insisted the new law would prevent them from hiring more workers if it increased their payroll to more than 50 employees . Under Obamacare , companies with more than 50 workers are obliged to provide health insurance or pay an annual fine of $ 2,000 per excess worker beyond the first 30—roughly a dollar per hour for a full-time employee . I appreciate the visceral reluctance to take on additional costs and paperwork , and can imagine marginal cases where a small company would decide it’s not worthwhile to grow . But I’m skeptical that many savvy businessmen would turn down a good opportunity to expand simply to avoid offering workers health insurance . If the value of the new business is greater than the employer’s share of an insurance plan or a fine , you go for it , right ? That’s called capitalism .Two other reasons the arguments that Obamacare is a job-killer don’t add up:1 . Although small-business lobbies tend not to mention it , businesses with fewer than 25 employees that already offer health insurance will be eligible for new tax credits ; that will free up money for investment .2 . The increased access to health care will create new jobs in the health care industry itself . As Harvard health economist Katherine Baicker has cautioned , expanding the health care sector should not be a goal of reform ; it’s more important to get the existing system working more efficiently . But providing access to systematic primary care for 30 million newcomers is bound to create new demand , not just for doctors and nurses but ( as Jonathan Gruber of MIT has written ) for assistants and technicians and support staff – “precisely the sort of medium-skill jobs that our economy desperately needs.” For these and other reasons , most economists who have studied the likely impact on employment say it will be quite small .There is considerable—and healthy—doubt about how well the Affordable Care Act will accomplish its second major aim , aside from expanding coverage : slowing the raging growth of health care spending . I agree that it will require real vigilance and oversight , and probably some fixes to the law , if Obamacare is to , as the saying goes , “bend the cost curve” downward . It will require moving more doctors from fee-per-service to salaries , more collaborative care , better electronic sharing of patient information , better controls on in-hospital infections . ( Reforms of medical malpractice law , an issue Obamacare skirted , would help , too . ) The Affordable Care Act takes first steps towards controlling the costs of our bloated system , but they are only first steps .Now , the myths , continued .Myth # 6 : Unions that supported Obama don’t have to comply with Obamacare . This allegation , repeated by several readers , harkens back to an anti-Obamacare ad by a Republican campaign group . The website PolitiFact skewered it last year . Briefly , one important provision of the new law forbids insurers from putting a cap of less than $ 750,000 on the care a person can get in one year . Some companies argued that if they complied right away , they would have to raise premiums on their workers or stop offering insurance altogether . To prevent that , the Obama administration government has granted waivers to companies ( and unions ) allowing them to keep the more limited insurance plans in place until 2014 . Politifact said the waivers have been granted to both companies and unions , with no pattern of special treatment .Myth # 7 : Obamacare creates a secretive board of bureaucrats with power to cut off grandpa’s dialysis or grandma’s chemotherapy . You don’t hear the phrase “death panels” much any more , but variations of that fallacy persist , like sightings of Sasquatch . The new law establishes an Independent Payment Advisory Board of health care professionals to propose ways to curb the growth of Medicare spending . It operates in public and makes systemic recommendations , which Congress can overrule . The board can reduce the amount Medicare pays health care providers for services and propose innovations to cut waste . It has no say in the treatment of any individual ; it can not change eligibility for Medicare , reduce benefits or raise premiums .Myth # 8 : Obamacare is a distraction from the main issue , which is jobs . This is the flip side of Myth # 1 , that Obamacare is a job-killer . You hear critics , right and left , saying that Obama took his eye off the ball—the economy—when he set out to push the health care act through Congress . TV anchors are constantly showing us polling results in which voters identify issues that matter most to them , with health care ranking a distant second or third to “the economy” or “jobs.” The implication is that health insurance is a side issue , unworthy of so much attention . But health insurance is inseparable from the larger discussion , both as a matter of economics and as a matter of psychology . Containing the cost of health care is integral to the fate of our economy . And the current dependency on employers for health insurance contributes mightily to the fear of losing a job .
Image taken down by requestI suggested yesterday that we’re probably heading for a turning point in the health reform discussion . Conservatives are operating on the assumption that it’s an irredeemable disaster that they can ride all the way to 2016 ; but the facts on the ground are getting better by the day , and Obamacare will turn into a Benghazi-type affair where Republicans are screaming about a scandal nobody else cares about .And it’s already starting to happen .White House officials are sounding increasingly upbeat . They could be deluded or spinning ; but after what happened two months ago one suspects that the last thing they want is to inflate expectations unduly .Meanwhile , media coverage is shifting fast . It’s still mostly trying for equivalence — each positive story of people being helped matched by a negative story of people hurt . But the stories don’t actually match up at all .Small example : earlier today I found myself trapped in a place with CNN on in the background , showing a fair-and-balanced account of losers and winners . First , the loser : a guy who admits that Obamacare has gotten him a plan cheaper than the insurance he had , but who has found that his current allergist is off-network . Annoying , no doubt ; but there are other allergists , and this particular one probably didn’t help the case by saying that he’s thinking of refusing to take Medicare patients , too .And in any case , insurance with restricted networks is hardly something new to Obamacare .Then , the winners : a couple with no insurance at all , because her premium would have been prohibitive and he has a preexisting condition that won’t let him buy any kind of insurance at all — but now both covered , at a very affordable price , by Covered California .I don’t know about you , but these don’t sound to me like equivalent stories .At this rate , the whole horrors-of-Obamacare meme will be gone in weeks , not months . But the GOP echo chamber won’t be able to let it go .
Imagine you are President Obama . You have about two more years in office , but your agenda is dead on arrival in the Republican-controlled Congress that takes over in January . What do you do ?One obvious strategy is to search for areas of common ground . However , the prospects for resolving existing stalemates in Washington on issues like immigration reform are unclear ( though deals on trade or tax reform are under discussion ) .Instead , Mr. Obama may seek to bring new issues into the conversation . That’s what he did Monday when he called on the Federal Communications Commission to promote “net neutrality , ” which would prevent preferential treatment of content online by Internet providers . The statement was seen as an effort to influence forthcoming rules from the commission , which is headed by an Obama appointee but operates independently .However , the President’s increasingly public embrace of net neutrality ( which he has supported since his 2008 campaign ) could come at a significant cost . Though Congress is already divided along party lines on the issue , Mr. Obama’s advocacy could strengthen Republican opposition to the issue .Presidential position-taking on issues like net neutrality can polarize sentiment in Congress . For instance , Ted Cruz , a Republican senator and a possible 2016 presidential contender , quickly condemned net neutrality as “Obamacare for the Internet.” Mr. Cruz’s negative reaction was echoed by House Speaker John Boehner and Mitch McConnell , who will become the Senate majority leader in January .President Obama may instead hope to go outside Congress , mobilizing sentiment like that expressed by Matthew Inman on the popular Internet cartoon The Oatmeal , or the comedian John Oliver , whose previous segment on the issue has attracted millions of views on YouTube .But efforts to mobilize the public on the issue are unlikely to succeed , as the political scientist Phil Arena noted on Twitter . Many Americans don’t know what net neutrality is or understand the debate over the issue . That’s why polling shows variable support depending on how the questions are framed . As people get increasingly partisan cues – Mr. Obama is for it , Republicans are against it – they are likely to follow their preferred party , which will further strengthen the partisan divide on the issue .Mr. Obama’s best hope is that his advocacy will pressure the F.C.C . to take a more aggressive approach . Even then , however , the commission “answers more to Congress , which controls its budget and the laws under which it operates” than to the president , as Edward Wyatt noted in The New York Times on Monday . With Republicans growing in strength on Capitol Hill , they might devote more legislative effort to opposing F.C.C . rule-making on the issue , restrict funding , or use other tools to hinder the agency , countering Mr. Obama . Already , congressional Republicans have issued a letter challenging the F.C.C . 's authority on this issue and scheduled an oversight hearing in the House .If the G.O.P . embraces opposition to net neutrality as part of its agenda , Mr. Obama’s party may come to see the downside of the bully pulpit that so many have demanded that he use .
Imagine you decide to replace the engine of a car . You have two goals : To make the car go faster , you put in a more powerful engine , say eight cylinders rather than six . But you also want to make it more fuel efficient , so you add some sophisticated new technologies to cut back on its gas guzzling .But this is untested technology , so you don’t have any idea which of these changes will prove to have a greater impact . Will the car consume more fuel because it is has become more powerful ? Or will the fuel efficiency improvements be effective enough that it uses less fuel despite the bigger engine . You won’t find out until you take the car for a drive .And that , in a nutshell , is why we have no idea how quickly the American economy is growing this year .The United States has overhauled its health care system , which accounts for one-sixth of the engine of the economy . But President Obama’s health reform legislation has two sets of goals . It aims to expand health coverage to millions of Americans without insurance . And it aims to make the American health care system more efficient , to force doctors and hospitals to deliver care in a more cost-effective way .As it turns out , the question of which of those efforts is more successful will have an outsize impact on the overall growth rate of the economy . That was one of the big lessons from new revisions to gross domestic product data earlier this week , which showed a surprise drop in health care spending ; earlier releases of the first-quarter data showed a large gain . That swing was a major reason the economy shrank at a 2.9 percent annual rate in the first three months of the year , its worst performance in five years .But what it really shows is how the implementation of health reform is going to cloud our understanding of the economy for some time to come .In normal times , health spending is the boring part of the G.D.P . report . It almost always grows : The first-quarter contraction was only the fourth quarterly decline in the last 80 quarters ( that’s going back to 1994 ) . Health spending reduced overall G.D.P . growth by only 0.16 of a percentage point . That isn’t that much in the scheme of things , but it was the most the health sector had subtracted from overall growth since the start of 1982 .In other words , when economy-watchers — analysts , journalists and others — parse the quarterly economic reports , health care is usually part of the boring backdrop while we focus on sexier sectors that show more volatility , like capital expenditures by businesses . ( As an aside , the fact that we consider trends in business equipment spending to be sexy is a reason you may not want to invite an economics reporter to your next cocktail party ) .But until the dust settles from Obamacare implementation , that has changed . The uncertainty around how the health law will affect spending patterns means that we may be in a period where quarter-to-quarter volatility in economic growth is driven by the micro details of how the health insurance law is working on the ground , rather than any broad momentum ( or lack thereof ) in the economy .What should we be rooting for ? This is an area where what is good for the country in the short run is at odds with what is good in the long run . It would be great to see a stronger recovery from the last recession , the kind of 4 or 5 percent growth that would put Americans back to work in a big way .But the United States also has the most expensive health care system in the world , without producing better health outcomes . If the nation succeeds at reducing health care costs while also getting coverage for more people , it will be a huge win for the country’s long-term competitiveness . Over time , the dollars that aren’t being spent on overpriced or unneeded health services can go to other stuff that makes lives better : houses , college education , restaurant meals and the like .The frustrating thing is that if that adjustment continues , it will do so while the economy is still far from full employment . That’s what happened in the first quarter : Health spending fell ( yay ! ) , but nothing else rose to take its place ( boo ! ) . It implies that we need to start seeing stronger growth in everything else to achieve robust growth even as the adjustment in the health care sector plays out .
In December 2012 , 56 percent of Americans approved of President Obama’s leadership . About 40 percent disapproved .Today , those numbers are almost precisely reversed , a fact that Democrats were made keenly aware of in the fall campaign and in the midterm elections .“The public’s confidence is gone , and it doesn’t seem to be coming back , ” says Ross Douthat at The New York Times .So what happened ?Mr. Douthat offers not a unified theory but four “partial” ones : Republican intransigence , an incomplete economic recovery from the Great Recession , Obamacare and foreign policy crises .Indeed , partial theories are popular among observers , and many land on similar issues . In an account of Obama’s second term , Juliet Eilperin and David Nakamura , writing at The Washington Post , detail what amounts to a war of attrition between the White House and Congress , with each side blaming the other for a lack of progress on legislation of any kind .What all the parties had to show for it , after multiple failures on policy and a government shutdown , was nothing but disapproval , The Post reporters write : “The president’s approval ratings took a nose dive , and Congress’s were even worse.”For Andrew Sullivan at The Dish , “a fanatically obstructionist and increasingly extreme GOP” wanted to undermine the president with a strategy “hatched privately before Obama even took office.”“They judged early on that the real promise of Obama — his ambition to transcend the old politics in favor of pragmatic reform — could be killed if they simply refused to play along , ” Mr. Sullivan writes .On the economy , Peter Foster at The Telegraph says : “Since Mr. Obama took office facing the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression , unemployment has fallen from 10 percent to 6 percent and American businesses have created 10 million new jobs — that’s more than Japan , Europe and every other advanced economy combined.”Problem is , he adds , many of those “jobs are ‘McJobs’ — that is , low-paid and part-time work that don’t leave people feeling better off.” On top of that , “in numerical terms , G.D.P . has risen by 8 percent since Mr. Obama took office , but median household incomes are down.”Mr. Douthat agrees : “Even with the improving employment picture this recovery is still basically a disappointment , especially for the middle class , ” and adds that it “isn’t necessarily a case study in the economy not mattering . It’s an example of voter patience persisting for a while , and finally running out.”“The most persuasive answer to the question” — where did Obama go wrong ? — “was the botched roll-out of healthcare.gov , ” Mr. Sullivan says . “No one else can be blamed for this , and it hit the president’s ratings like a ten-ton truck.”Mr. Douthat points to competence as a general concern for the public with this administration and identifies the roll-out as a key moment : “The health care law is Obama’s signature issue , it remains largely unpopular ( even if support for full repeal is weak ) , and its initial stumbling coincided with the sharpest second-term drop in the president’s approval.”Yet for Mr. Sullivan , this is only the start of the narrative : “What this superficial version of events misses is what happened next . The truth is : the Obama team subsequently achieved a near-miraculous rescue of Obamacare , achieved real success in enrollment , and have seen core healthcare costs slow down in such a way that could yet shift our long-term fiscal liabilities for the better.”Still , as Mr. Foster points out , “Like George W. Bush after Hurricane Katrina , Mr. Obama’s approval numbers never recovered from the sight of his flagship piece of legislation capsizing so ignominiously before it had even left the harbour.”Mr. Douthat suggests that the president “had an edge that Democratic politicians often lack : The public trusted him on foreign policy.”But , he writes , one crisis after another — Syria , Ukraine , ISIS , Ebola — eroded that trust and “made Obama’s position irrecoverable.”While acknowledging that Mr. Obama’s refusal “to engage in the theatrical parts of the presidency looks terrible during crises , ” Danny Vinik at The New Republic , like Mr. Sullivan , defends the president on issues like ISIS , at least on substantive grounds : “It’s more important that the president craft effective policy responses to crises . Obama has done that — and the media coverage has missed it completely , focusing instead on Obama’s rhetorical shortcomings and downplaying his policy successes.”Conor Friedersdorf at The Atlantic has an entirely different log of reasons to disapprove of Mr. Obama’s performance . His list includes warrantless wiretapping , a failure to punish illegal torture , a costly and ruinous war on drugs , the unacknowledged moral costs of drone strikes , the president’s “secret kill list , ” an out-of-control national-security state and the president’s persecution of whistle-blowers and journalists who’ve worked with them .“Confronted with all of those transgressions , more than four in 10 Americans still approve of the job Obama is doing , ” Mr. Friedersdorf writes . “And most of them are loyal Democrats . Partisanship and tribalism are overriding the moral compass of too many liberals.”For Elias Isquith at Salon , the root of the president’s problems is not to be found in specific events or issues but in his temperament . Many moderates see “Obama’s penchant for working from within the system rather than trying to disrupt it” as a real plus .But , he asks , was this temperamental conservatism “the wrong fit for the current era , when major reforms are so desperately needed” ?Mr. Isquith turns back to a 2009 Harper’s article by Kevin Baker , predicting that Mr. Obama would fail , because he would be unable “to seize the radical moment at hand.”For Mr. Isquith , “Rather than recognize how ideological and partisan realignment and polarization had effectively changed the rules of the Senate , ” the president went looking for consensus where none existed .“At this point , there is no question that President Obama will fall short of initial expectations , ” Mr. Isquith says . “But more than the failure to pass any one particular bill , the disappointment stems from the president’s dogged insistence on being a reformer during a radical era.”But perhaps our focus on the presidency is itself skewed . The presidency is the central element in our political system , but as Aaron David Miller writes , maybe the problem is our expectation of the presidency itself .He argues at Foreign Policy ( and in his book “The End of Greatness : Why America Can’t Have ( and Doesn’t Want ) Another Great President” ) : “The centrality of the presidency must be reconciled with the limitations of the office and the constraints that bind it . The presidency has always been an implausible , some might even say an impossible , job . But the following mix of challenges and constraints — some old , some new — has made the post-World War II presidency harder still : constitutional and practical constraints on the office itself ; the president’s expanding reach and responsibilities ; the expanding role of a government we trust less , even when we demand more from it ; America’s global role ; and an intrusive , omnipresent , and nonstop media.”“Greatness in the presidency is too rare to be relevant in our modern times and — driven as it is in our political system by big crisis — too risky and dangerous to be desirable . Our continued search for idealized presidents raises our expectations and theirs , skews presidential performance , and leads to an impossible standard that can only frustrate and disappoint . To sum up : We can no longer have a truly great president , we seldom need one , and , as irrational as it sounds , we may not want one , either.”He concludes : “Historic greatness in the presidency has gone the way of the dodo . And it is unlikely to return any time soon.”
In a rare fit of realism on Tuesday , Senator Mitch McConnell , the Republican leader , admitted he would be unable to repeal the Affordable Care Act if Republicans win the Senate next week and he becomes majority leader . That would take 60 votes , he said , and no one thinks Republicans will get that many .But conservatives reacted with anger to what they considered a demonstration of weakness , and on Thursday Mr. McConnell was forced to backtrack . Yes , his spokesman told The Washington Examiner , Mr. McConnell remains “committed to the full repeal of Obamacare” with only a simple majority , through a parliamentary procedure known as reconciliation .Those two comments are a pretty good indication of what life will be like in Congress if Republicans gain control of the Senate in Tuesday’s election , and if Mr. McConnell wins his race in Kentucky . It’s not just that they are committed to time-wasting , obstructionist promises like repeal of health care reform , which everyone knows President Obama would veto . The bigger problem is that the party’s leaders have continually proved unable to resist pressure from the radical right , which may very well grow in the next session of Congress .Tea Party loyalists like Senator Ted Cruz of Texas already have far too much sway over the Republican caucus , but if they become the majority , things could become worse . The Republican Senate candidate in Iowa , Joni Ernst , wants to ban abortions and same-sex marriage and impeach the president . In Georgia , David Perdue , the Republican candidate , said his biggest task is to “prosecute the failed record” of the Obama administration . Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas , a three-term incumbent in a tough race for re-election , promised voters that a Republican majority “means a stop to the Obama agenda.”A Republican majority wouldn’t really be able to reverse Mr. Obama’s most significant accomplishments , but in the act of trying , it could do a great deal of damage . Mr. McConnell has already made it clear how he would proceed : He intends to attach his demands to required spending bills , forcing the president to choose between accepting Republican policies and vetoing spending bills , which could lead to shutting down all or part of the government .Those demands could take the form of riders aimed at blocking an array of environmental activities — everything from limiting carbon pollution from power plants to protecting clean water — and at repealing new consumer protections and restrictions on financial institutions . There would be no minimum-wage increase , or big investments in education , or immigration reform .Republicans would also be certain to block Mr. Obama’s choices for judgeships — all but guaranteeing a judicial crisis unless the president agreed to conservative choices — as well as his executive appointments , starting with a new attorney general . It’s hard to imagine a Congress less productive than this one , but obstructionism could actually get worse if a new majority took hold .
In a story about anti-Obamacare deadenders , Talking Points Memo runs this picture:As it happens , I’ve recently had fairly extensive dealings with both our health care system and with the New Jersey DMV . In one case , I encountered vast amounts of paperwork , mind-numbing bureaucracy , and extremely frustrating delays . In the other , my needs were met quickly and politely .So far , then , it’s DMV 1 , private health system ( and I have very good insurance ) 0 .
In an ideal world , ads for congressional candidates would not look like promos for “Homeland.”But there they are ! Grainy shots of barbed-wire , terrorist training camps and men in Arab garb firing large weapons , overlaid with scary sound clips from cable news . ( “Are they coming for us ? ” )O.K. , we’re scared enough . We already had the Iraqi prime minister free-associating about terrorists in the subways this week . We don’t need to be told that if we vote for the wrong candidate in November , it’s curtains .In an election year , there’s certainly a lot of foreign policy to debate . Should Congress be voting on whether we’re going to war ? Which of the candidates think we should send American troops ? Should we really be arming Syrian rebels ?You will be stunned to hear that none of these issues are the subject of campaign ads . What we’re getting is stuff like:“Staci Appel — Passports for Terrorists” ( Iowa )“Dan Maffei Puts Us at Risk” ( New York )“Michelle Nunn’s own plan says she funded organizations linked to terrorists.” ( Georgia )That last one comes from Republican Senate candidate David Perdue . We don’t have time here to follow the intricate , pothole-paved path that led the Perdue camp to that conclusion . But to get there you have to be prepared to believe that Points of Light , a charity founded by George H. W. Bush , has been assisting Hamas .The Republican fear-mongering has several aims . One is to remind voters that the Democratic candidate in question belongs to the same party as Barack Obama . This is totally fair . It may get boring , but it is not against the rules .Theme 2 is that Candidate X is making it easier for Americans who trained as terrorists overseas to get back into the country and blow something up .Staci Appel , a candidate for Congress in Des Moines , fell into a deep hole during a debate when her Republican opponent said that if he were in office , he’d “be urging our State Department” to revoke the passports of people who have admitted they belong to terrorist organizations .Since “urging” is pretty much all members of Congress do these days , it sounds like a relatively harmless way to pass the time . However , Appel demurred , and said “we need to make sure that we work through the system.”Perhaps she misunderstood what he was saying . But you know what happened next . The poor woman was eventually forced to run her own ad announcing that she “Supports Revoking Passports for Terrorists.”Meanwhile , up in New Hampshire , Republican Senate candidate Scott Brown has been bragging that when he was last in office — during a previous incarnation as the senator from Massachusetts — he sponsored a bill to revoke the citizenship of anyone who gives aid to a terrorist group .That’s a lot different from passports . You can certainly try somebody for treason , but there’s no way to just decree that an American is no longer an American . The founding fathers were very clear on that point . If you resurrected James Madison and showed him Obamacare and citizenship-stripping , I can guarantee you which one would freak him out .The most popular terrorism-connected campaign theme is overall border security , since it allows conservative candidates to roll up ISIS terrorists with illegal Hispanic immigrants . “She’s for amnesty , while terrorism experts say our border breakdown could provide an entry for groups like ISIS ! ” announced that David Perdue ad against Michelle Nunn in Georgia . Some experts believe that even at this early hour , Perdue has wrapped up the title of Worst Commercial of the Campaign .The “terrorism experts , ” by the way , are actually the Texas Department of Public Safety .Brown took up the same theme this week , lacing into both President Obama and his opponent , Senator Jeanne Shaheen , for a “passive , pathetic attitude” on protecting the borders .This was during his first foreign affairs speech as a candidate in New Hampshire . Shaheen’s campaign took the occasion to remind the world that when he was representing Massachusetts , Brown had boasted about his “secret meetings with kings and queens , ” which appear to have all been fictional .Except for citizenship-revoking , Brown’s speech was general in the extreme . It would be great to hear some specifics .Right now the United States spends more on border security than on all the rest of its criminal law enforcement agencies combined . Under President Obama , the Department of Homeland Security has constructed nearly 650 miles of fences . The number of border patrol agents has doubled to more than 20,000 . They patrol every mile of the border every day , aided by 10 drones .When candidates announce they want to beef up border security , how much more do you think they want to spend ? Should there be an agent every 500 feet ? A line of officers holding hands from the Pacific to the Gulf of Mexico ? Inquiring minds want to know .Maybe they could put it in an ad .
In response to polling data showing that the Affordable Care Act has become more popular , a prominent Republican pollster said that he expected Republicans to change how they talked about the law .“After the primaries , expect a shift in Republican candidates’ rhetoric against Obamacare , ” said Bill McInturff , a partner in Public Opinion Strategies . “Only few want to repeal the law , ” he said of voters . “Most want to fix and keep it.”Mr. McInturff , speaking at the annual conference of the American Association for Public Opinion Research in Anaheim , Calif. , was referring to results from survey work his firm does with Hart Research Associates for NBC News and The Wall Street Journal .Mr. McInturff said he still believed the law would hurt Democrats in the midterm campaign . President Obama’s personal ratings suffered last November after the rollout of the health-care plan . Although there has been some recovery , Mr. McInturff does not believe there will be enough time before the midterm elections to repair the damage . He added that Mr. Obama’s incorrect assertion that people could keep their health-care plan if they wanted had appeared to be particularly harmful .“It will take two or three years for the law to shake out , ” he said . “If the law is perceived as working , it will help the Democrats ; if it is perceived as not working , the Republicans will benefit.”

Independent , educated and socially-progressive voters who might be persuaded to vote for the G.O.P .Discussing how best to reinvigorate the Republican party , Michael J. Petrilli argued in The Wall Street Journal:
It goes without saying that Obamacare had a disastrous rollout . But it’s not October any more . Enrollment is rising fast , and administration officials — who have every reason not to overpromise after what happened last time — are sounding increasingly confident .Yet as Greg Sargent notes , right-wing pundits , from Bill Kristol to the WSJ , have clearly decided that the GOP will win big in 2014 by running against the Obamacare debacle . The possibility that it might not be perceived as a debacle by November — that it might even be perceived as a qualified success — doesn’t seem to figure at all in their thinking .Why the disconnect ? Well , it’s feeling to me a lot like the later months of the 2012 campaign , when the polls clearly pointed to an Obama win but Republicans lived in a closed information loop where such information was excluded — the only polls they heard about were “unskewed” to remove the unwelcome information .So right now I see a lot of analyses that take the October-November average enrollment and present it as the shape of things to come — see , enrollment is far behind the predicted pace , and it’s mainly Medicaid ! No acknowledgment of the reality that these numbers are weighed down by a non-functional website that’s pretty functional now , that the pace has accelerated dramatically , and that experience in Massachusetts tells us to expect a surge of enrollment , especially among healthy Americans , as the deadline for avoiding the penalty approaches .Meanwhile , polling on health reform is already improving , even though a majority of voters don’t yet know how much better the signup process is working .Obviously a lot of things can happen in the months ahead . But 2014 may be more like 2012 than anyone imagines .

It goes without saying that the rollout of Obamacare was an epic disaster . But what kind of disaster was it ? Was it a failure of management , messing up the initial implementation of a fundamentally sound policy ? Or was it a demonstration that the Affordable Care Act is inherently unworkable ?We know what each side of the partisan divide wants you to believe . The Obama administration is telling the public that everything will eventually be fixed , and urging Congressional Democrats to keep their nerve . Republicans , on the other hand , are declaring the program an irredeemable failure , which must be scrapped and replaced with ... well , they donât really want to replace it with anything .At a time like this , you really want a controlled experiment . What would happen if we unveiled a program that looked like Obamacare , in a place that looked like America , but with competent project management that produced a working website ?Well , your wish is granted . Ladies and gentlemen , I give you California .Now , California isnât the only place where Obamacare is looking pretty good . A number of states that are running their own online health exchanges instead of relying on HealthCare.gov are doing well . Kentuckyâs Kynect is a huge success ; so is Access Health CT in Connecticut . New York is doing O.K . And we shouldnât forget that Massachusetts has had an Obamacare-like program since 2006 , put into effect by a guy named Mitt Romney .California is , however , an especially useful test case . First of all , itâs huge : if a system can work for 38 million people , it can work for America as a whole . Also , itâs hard to argue that California has had any special advantages other than that of having a government that actually wants to help the uninsured . When Massachusetts put Romneycare into effect , it already had a relatively low number of uninsured residents . California , however , came into health reform with 22 percent of its nonelderly population uninsured , compared with a national average of 18 percent .Finally , the California authorities have been especially forthcoming with data tracking the progress of enrollment . And the numbers are increasingly encouraging .For one thing , enrollment is surging . At this point , more than 10,000 applications are being completed per day , putting the state well on track to meet its overall targets for 2014 coverage . Just imagine , by the way , how different press coverage would be right now if Obama officials had produced a comparable success , and around 100,000 people a day were signing up nationwide .Equally important is the information on who is enrolling . To work as planned , health reform has to produce a balanced risk pool â that is , it must sign up young , healthy Americans as well as their older , less healthy compatriots . And so far , so good : in October , 22.5 percent of California enrollees were between the ages of 18 and 34 , slightly above that groupâs share of the population .What we have in California , then , is a proof of concept . Yes , Obamacare is workable â in fact , done right , it works just fine .The bad news , of course , is that most Americans arenât lucky enough to live in states in which Obamacare has , in fact , been done right . Theyâre stuck either with HealthCare.gov or with one of the state exchanges , like Oregonâs , that have similar or worse problems . Will they ever get to experience successful health reform ?The answer is , probably yes . There wonât be a moment when the clouds suddenly lift , but the exchanges are gradually getting better â a point inadvertently illustrated a few days ago by John Boehner , the speaker of the House . Mr. Boehner staged a publicity stunt in which he tried to sign up on the D.C. health exchange , then triumphantly posted an entry on his blog declaring that he had been unsuccessful . At the bottom of his post , however , is a postscript admitting that the health exchange had called back âa few hours later , â and that he is now enrolled .And maybe the transaction would have proceeded faster if Mr. Boehnerâs office hadnât , according to the D.C. exchange , put its agent â who was calling to help finish the enrollment â on hold for 35 minutes , listening to âlots of patriotic hold music.âThere will also probably be growing use of workarounds â for example , encouraging people to go directly to insurers . This will temporarily defeat one of the purposes of the exchanges , which was to make price comparisons easy , but it will be good enough as a short-term patch . And one shouldnât forget that the insurance industry has a big financial stake in the success of Obamacare , and will soon be pitching in with big efforts to sign people up .Again , Obamacareâs rollout was a disaster . But in California we can see what health reform will look like , beyond the glitches . And itâs going to work .
It has not escaped the notice of political analysts that 72 percent of whites without college degrees — a rough proxy for what we used to call the white working class — believe that “the U.S. economic system generally favors the wealthy.” Or that on Nov. 4 , these same men and women voted for Republican House candidates 64-34 .Similarly , the overwhelmingly white electorates of Alaska , Arkansas , Nebraska and South Dakota voted decisively in referendums to raise the minimum wage while simultaneously voting for Republicans , whose party has adamantly rejected legislation to raise the minimum wage .There is an ongoing debate among politicians , political scientists and partisans of both parties over the dismal support of Democratic candidates among whites . Does it result from ideological differences , racial animosity or a perception among many whites that they are excluded from a coalition of minorities , the poor , single women of all races , gays and other previously marginalized constituencies ?Arguably , the poor Democratic showing among whites does not represent naked race prejudice , as Obama’s election and re-election attest . But it can be seen as a reflection of substantial material interests that affect the very voters who carry greater weight in low turnout midterm Congressional elections .Whites as a whole , who made up 75 percent of this year’s electorate , voted for Republican House candidates by a 24-point margin , 62-38 , the exact same margin by which they supported Republican candidates in the 2010 midterms . In 2006 , when opposition to President George W. Bush was intense , Republicans won white voters by eight points , 52-44 .The opposition of whites to the Democratic Party is visible not only in voting behavior , but in general opposition to key Democratic policy initiatives , most tellingly in hostility toward the Affordable Care Act . A November 2013 National Journal poll found , for example , that 58 percent of whites said Obamacare would make things worse for “people like you and your family , ” more than double the 25 percent that said that Obamacare would make things better .Asked whether the Affordable Care Act would make things better or worse for the country at large , 60 percent of whites said worse and 35 percent of whites said better .Obamacare shifts health care benefits and tax burdens from upper-income Americans to lower-income Americans , and from largely white constituencies to beneficiaries disproportionately made up of racial and ethnic minorities . The program increases levies on the overwhelmingly white affluent by raising taxes on households making more than $ 250,000 .To achieve its goals , Obamacare reduces spending on Medicare by $ 500 billion over 10 years , according to the Medicare board of trustees , which oversees the finances of the program . Medicare serves a population that is 77 percent white . Even as reductions in Medicare spending fall disproportionately on white voters , the savings are being used to finance Obamacare , which includes a substantial expansion of Medicaid . Medicaid recipients are overwhelmingly poor and , in 2013 , were 41 percent white and 59 percent minority .In addition to expanding Medicaid , the overall goal of Obamacare is to provide health coverage for the uninsured , a population that , in 2010 when the program was enacted , was 47 percent white , and 53 percent black , Hispanic , Asian-American and other minorities .It’s not hard to see , then , why a majority of white midterm voters withheld support from Democrats and cast their votes for Republicans .Republicans are not satisfied with winning 62 percent of the white vote . To counter the demographic growth of Democratic constituencies whose votes threaten Republican success in high-turnout presidential elections , Republicans have begun a concerted effort to rupture the partisan loyalty of the remaining white Democratic voters . Their main target is socially liberal , fiscally conservative suburbanites , the weakest reeds in the Democratic coalition . These middle-income white voters do not share the acute economic needs of so-called downscale Democratic voters and they are less reliant on government services .The Republican strategy to win over these more culturally tolerant , but still financially pressed , white voters is to continue to focus on material concerns – on anxiety about rising tax burdens , for example — while downplaying the preoccupation of many of the most visible Republicans with social , moral and cultural repression .The current effectiveness of the anti-tax strategy was demonstrated in the unexpected victory of Larry Hogan , the Republican gubernatorial candidate in deep blue Maryland , who defeated Anthony Brown , the highly favored Democratic lieutenant governor .“The average Marylander sees a governor and legislature willing to impose record tax increases on the rest of us that we don’t need , don’t want and can’t afford , ” Hogan declared at the start of his campaign and repeated relentlessly until Election Day .Hogan won by decisively carrying all the majority white suburbs surrounding Baltimore city , including Howard County , a former bastion of suburban Democratic strength .In Colorado , Cory Gardner , the Republican Senate nominee , joined the Republican assault on Obamacare and taxes:Significantly , Gardner also stiff-armed the Christian right on issues of contraception and abortion in his successful two-point win over Mark Udall , the Democratic incumbent . Gardner highlighted a more culturally tolerant approach when he endorsed over the counter access to the “morning after” pill – a form of contraception many in the right to life movement consider a form of abortion – and when he renounced past sponsorship of a “personhood” constitutional amendment titled “The Life Begins at Conception Act.”In a mea culpa comment rarely heard in campaigns , Gardner told The Denver Post:Despite this , not only did the Christian right stick with Gardner , but white evangelicals provided his margin of victory . These religious voters , who made up 25 percent of the Colorado midterm electorate , voted for Gardner over Udall by a resounding 70 points , 83 to 13 . This margin was enough to compensate for Udall’s 20-point victory , 57 percent to 37 percent , among the remaining 75 percent of the Colorado electorate .The clear implication of these results for Republican candidates running in 2016 and beyond is that you can break with conservative orthodoxy on some issues to better appeal to a general election electorate without paying the price of losing white Christian support .If Republicans are successful in toning down their candidates , it will take from Democrats a weapon that has proved highly successful in state and federal elections : demonizing Republican Party candidates as a collection of knuckle-dragging Neanderthals .The Democrats’ portrayal of Republicans has served to motivate both Democratic voters and donors , especially suburban white Democrats , by tapping into their anger and fear of a morally intrusive Republican Party .“Anger in politics can play a particularly vital role , motivating some people to participate in ways they might ordinarily not , ” according to Nicholas Valentino , a professor of communication studies and political science at the University of Michigan , and the lead author of “Election Night’s Alright for Fighting : The Role of Emotions in Political Participation , ” a 2011 study of voter motivation .A Democratic tactic designed to focus on mobilizing white voters – the sustained effort led by Senator Harry Reid to demonize the Koch brothers – has not yet , by most accounts , paid off .As they have after past Election Day defeats , Democrats can hope for Republican infighting between the establishment and Tea Party wings . Such internecine conflict , in fact , has already begun .Democrats can also count on greater voter participation by their loyalists in a presidential year , and on advantageous demographic trends : The share of the electorate held by older and working-class whites , the core of the Republican Party , diminishes every year , while Democratic constituencies continue to grow .In the aftermath of the 2012 election , the obligation to change fell upon the Republican Party . With the support of Karl Rove , the Republican National Committee , under its chairman , Reince Priebus , pulled the party to the center , with Priebus producing the famous autopsy report calling for political moderation . To the surprise of many , the party’s candidates this year took key suggestions to heart .Insofar as the Republican Party successfully sandpapers its sharp edges , the necessity for change will now shift to the Democrats . Most recently , this kind of metamorphosis was accomplished by Bill Clinton’s 1992 “Southern governor’s strategy” presidential campaign when he defied liberal orthodoxy on such issues as welfare and the death penalty .One question presents itself : how transformative a political leader is Hillary Clinton ? Can she avoid entrapment by divisive issues of key importance to competing wings of the center-left coalition : L.G.B.T . rights ; marijuana legalization ; climate change ; gun control ; racial profiling ; fracking ; pension rights for public employee unions ; citizenship for undocumented immigrants ; and the ever pressing social welfare needs of the country’s poor ?In May 2008 , with Obama taking the lead , Hillary Clinton committed to continue the race “for the nurse on her second shift , for the worker on the line , for the waitress on her feet , for the small-business owner , the farmer , the teacher , the coal miner , the trucker , the soldier , the veteran.”As James Oliphant , the National Journal’s White House correspondent wrote:The white vote in the years since 1992 has become consistently more committed to Republican candidates . Mitt Romney carried whites by a 20-point margin , 59-39 , larger than either John McCain , 12 points , or George W. Bush , 17 points .Clinton has her work cut out for her , especially if the Republican nominee heeds the advice of party leaders and makes a concerted effort to further erode — by whatever means necessary — white Democratic support .
Itâs pretty clear that the implementation of Obamacare will set the tone for how Americans think about government for years to come . There are two large questions to be settled , which you might call the questions of competence and coercion .The first is whether the government is competent enough to manage large programs . Can the administration get the website to work , set rules for the right insurance products or impose efficiency measures to restrain costs ?These are still open questions . Democrats see the early messiness as the temporary teething pains inevitable to a new large enterprise . Republicans see them as the first stages in the unraveling of an unworkable Rube Goldberg machine . But the fact is that we canât yet know who is right . Over the next few years , the implementation will either go more smoothly and build faith in federal competence or go as it has been and destroy it .But weâre already getting a clearer answer on the question of coercion . Cast aside for a second any negative connotation to that word . Almost all large government programs , even very popular ones like Social Security , involve a degree of coercion . Government builds a system and forces everyone to operate within it .Obamacare , as originally envisioned , mandated that people join the system in order to redistribute money from the healthy and young to the sicker and older . It coerces some people to do something they might not want to do , and which , in fact , may not be in their short-term interest to do .Already , itâs very clear that millions of Americans â and not just Tea Party types â do not accept the legitimacy of the government to overrule individual decisions , even on something like health insurance . This is not the America of 1932 or of 1964 . This is an America steeped in distrust of government . Itâs an America that is , on both left and right , steeped in the ethos of individual choice . Itâs an America steeped in a morality of authenticity , which says that it is right to listen to the individual voice within and immoral to be forced to conform to the external commands from without .From the very first moment , people have had problems with the idea of mandates . Barack Obama beat Hillary Clinton among a Democratic primary electorate in 2008 in part because he opposed mandates . When Obamacare was still a bill , members of Congress succumbed to political pressure and lowered the penalties that would be imposed on those who violated the mandates . Then the Supreme Court majority decided the penalties werenât even penalties ; they were just an optional tax .When disgruntled groups have objected to the employer and other mandates during implementation , the administration has generally loosened , delayed or suspended them . Late last week , the administration granted a âhardship exemptionâ to people who had their prior coverage canceled and who believe that the mandated Obamacare offerings are unaffordable .Most telling , the administration hasnât even made a moral argument for the mandates . It hasnât even tried to make the case that coercing some people to participate in collective action is necessary for the common good .It now seems possible that no one will be paying the mandate penalties in 2014 . Having exempted some groups from the mandate already , it will be politically difficult to start enforcing it on others . And , looking further into the future , why should we think Democrats will suddenly crack down and enforce the mandate in the run-up to the next presidential election ?This part of the law is like an unpopular , insecure person at a family reunion , who is walking on eggshells and making concessions right and left for fear of offending anybody . In the age of the Internet , people are used to decentralized systems and maximum personal choice . The mandated elements of Obamacare may look good on paper and they may be necessary to get the plan to work , but they probably canât survive the public sense they are illegitimate .Governing in an age of distrust is different than governing in an age of trust . Government now lacks the legitimacy to impose costs on losers , so politicians face unprecedented pressure to create situations in which everybody looks like winners . Government lacks the legitimacy to coerce . People like Social Security , but I bet you that Congress could not pass a Social Security law today . If people were unfamiliar with the concept , you couldnât pass a bill that said : Government is going to confiscate money from each paycheck and spend it on other things , but donât worry because youâll get it back decades from now when you retire .The erosion of the mandate wonât kill Obamacare over all . Itâll just make it much more expensive for the government . But the larger lesson is that to sustain a program in this culture , you probably have to rely on policy mechanisms that maximize consumer-style choice , not mandates .
It’s no secret that Senator John McCain doesn’t much like Senator Ted Cruz , whom he once called a “wacko bird.” His main grievance is that Mr. Cruz isn’t interested in the business of governing , which requires compromise . If Mr. Cruz can’t get what he wants , he’d rather muck up the Senate than give in .This character trait was on brilliant display from Tuesday until this morning . For 21 hours and 19 minutes Mr. Cruz attacked the Affordable Care Act and read from Dr. Seuss’s “Green Eggs and Ham , ” among other time-wasting tactics , in a quasi-filibuster . ( “Quasi” because he wasn’t actually in a position to stop Senate proceedings , as The National Journal explained . ) Democrats weren’t keen on the speech . Neither , for that matter , were Republicans . Mr. McCain was among those who felt Mr. Cruz was merely grandstanding , and earlier today he went so far as to suggest that Mr. Cruz’s diatribe was fundamentally undemocratic .I’d remind my colleagues that , in the 2012 election , Obamacare , as it’s called — and I’ll be more polite , the A.C.A . — was a subject that was a major issue in the campaign . I campaigned all over America for two months , everywhere I could . And in every single campaign rally I said “we had to repeal and replace Obamacare.” Well , the people spoke . They spoke , much to my dismay , but they spoke and they re-elected the president of the United States . No that doesn’t mean that we give up our efforts to try to replace and repair Obamacare . But it does mean elections have consequences and those elections were clear , in a significant majority , that the majority of the American people supported the president of the U.S. and renewed his stewardship of this country . I don’t like it , it’s not something that I wanted the outcome to be . But I think all of us should respect the outcome of elections , which reflects the will of the people .
It’s the biggest expansion of government and Washington’s biggest response to inequality in decades . So no wonder it’s the political story that won’t die .The two serious subplots of Obamacare revolve around a new open-enrollment period and a new Supreme Court case . The open-enrollment period starts Saturday , for people who don’t receive their insurance from their employer , Medicare or Medicaid . Margot Sanger-Katz , working with Kevin Quealy , developed a handy guide to the big questions about the enrollment — both for people interested in getting health insurance and for those merely interested in following the story . If our FAQs don’t answer your question , let us know .We’ll obviously be following the open-enrollment period in other ways as well , because it will provide important clues about how well the Affordable Care Act is functioning . In a separate story this morning , Margot notes that the early signs on premiums are positive : They’re barely rising in the major cities for which we have data so far . Elsewhere on The Upshot this week , Neil Irwin covered the controversy involving remarks by Jonathan Gruber , an economist whose ideas helped shape the law . As Neil writes , that controversy sheds light on a dirty little Washington secret .And about that Supreme Court case : It’s still months away , but it’s a big deal . The court has announced that it will consider a challenge to the law that could cancel the subsidies that millions of people in more than 30 states receive to buy health insurance . Only four of the nine justices need to agree to accept a case , so the fact that the court took the case doesn’t mean that it will cancel the subsidies . But there is little obvious reason for justices to take the case unless they want to do so .The latest attack on President Obama’s health care law already seems to have four votes at the court . The question is whether it will find a fifth .This article is part of The Upshot’s weekly newsletter .
I’m not usually interested in White House intrigue , and I’m no Kremlinologist , but it does seem bizarre to claim that Democratic consolidation behind Obamacare is a vindication for Rahm Emanuel , of all people .The story as everyone reported it was that after the Massachusetts election , Emanuel wanted Obama to go small , basically give up on comprehensive health reform — and that Emanuel lost out when Obama decided to go big instead . Now the fact that going big looks likely to get through Congress — not in the bag yet , of course — and that if it does , it will almost surely be good for the Democrats , confirms that … Emanuel was right ?Actually , does anyone remember the 2006 midterms ? As I recall it , Emanuel wanted Dems to stay quiet about Iraq , and run on the economy — but was overruled . And then when Dems pulled out a historic victory , he claimed credit .I kind of like this approach . When Obama switches to harsh fiscal austerity , and the Fed sharply raises rates — and despite everything I’ve been saying , the economy prospers — I’m going to call it a vindication of my economic wisdom .
I’m sure someone else has pointed this out , but there’s a fundamental contradiction at the heart of the right’s anti-Obamacare strategy — I mean , aside from the fact that it isn’t going to work , and may do immense damage both to America and to the Republican brand .On one side , as Jonathan Cohn points out , inside the right-wing bubble it’s taken as gospel that Obamacare will be an utter , obvious disaster:If you sincerely believe Obamacare will bankrupt the country , violate personal liberty , raise costs or ruin insurance for most Americans , and generally destroy American health care , then it’s easy to believe that it’s only a matter of time before the rest of the country demands repeal—forcing both Senate Democrats and the president to go along . It’s particularly easy to believe this if you live in the right-wing media bubble , where all of the reports about Obamacare focus on the law’s shortcomings and failures—insurance premiums going up , people losing coverage , part-time workers losing hours , and so on .But if the right really believed this , it should be happy to let Obamacare come into existence , then collapse . The last thing Republicans should want is to let Democrats snatch victory from the jaws of defeat by provoking confrontations over the budget and the debt ceiling before the American people get to experience the nightmare of expanded insurance coverage .In fact , politically the right is acting as if it fears that Obamacare will , in reality , be highly popular — that once the exchanges and the Medicare Medicaid expansion go into effect , people will decide that they like the new system , and strongly oppose efforts to reverse course . ( This is almost surely the more realistic view . ) So the law must be stopped at any cost before it goes into effect , and people learn first-hand that the anti-Obamacare propaganda was false .So which is it ? Are Republicans sure that disaster looms , or are they terrified because they suspect that things will be OK ? My guess is , both : clear thinking is not exactly a hallmark of the modern GOP , and may indeed be a positive disqualification for career success .Unfortunately , fear of Obamacare success is in the driving seat right now , and may well lead to government shutdown , debt default , or both .
JONESBORO , Ark . — Former President Bill Clinton , plunging right into his home state’s tight elections , implored Arkansans on Monday to support the Democratic ticket and defy predictions that turnout will plummet without a presidential race on the ballot .“You don’t have the luxury of staying home , so I am pleading with you : Vote , ” Mr. Clinton told college students at an outdoor rally here at Arkansas State University’s campus .It was his first appearance of the fall campaign in the state that propelled him to the White House , and Mr. Clinton was notably spirited as he lashed out at out-of-state conservative groups that have hammered Senator Mark Pryor , the only Democrat remaining in the state’s congressional delegation and perhaps the most endangered Senate incumbent in the country this year .Mr. Clinton — joined by Mr. Pryor ; Gov . Mike Beebe ; and former Representative Mike Ross , the Democratic nominee hoping to succeed Mr. Beebe — addressed selfie-snapping students at two state universities and seemed to relish being back on the Arkansas campaign trail . He spoke in blunt terms at the first rally of the day at the University of Central Arkansas in Conway about how Republicans are trying to make the election about President Obama , who is deeply unpopular here .Republicans , he said , “want you to make this a protest vote , ” alluding to the Senate and governor’s races as well as a competitive House contest in Central Arkansas .“All three of these races , they’re saying , ‘Hey , you might like these guys but , hey , you know what you got to do , you got to vote against the president . After all , it’s your last shot , ’ ” Mr. Clinton said . “It’s a pretty good scam isn’t it ? Give me a six-year job for a two-year protest . That’s Mark Pryor’s opponent’s message.”If this was a veiled help-is-on-the-way message , it was the only implicit reference to the 2016 presidential election . Mr. Clinton made no mention of his wife and her plans , whatever they may be .The former president has deep personal connections to many of the candidates on the Democratic ticket this year and has regularly offered them advice about their campaigns . But Arkansas has become a far different place politically in the 40 years since Mr. Clinton first ran for office here .Arkansas resisted the Republican tide far longer than most any other Southern state , but has finally given way to the region’s partisan realignment . Republicans now control both chambers of the Legislature , and if Mr. Pryor loses , the party will hold all six seats in the congressional delegation .Officials in both parties said Mr. Obama’s unpopularity explained why this last bulwark of Southern Democratic strength fell . And Mr. Clinton made no effort to deny that theory on Monday .“They’re really running against the president , aren’t they ? ” he said in Conway . Speaking as much as a strategist as a surrogate , he continued : “Yeah , the economy is coming back . But nobody believes it yet because you don’t feel it.”Returning to the preferred Democratic message this year , he echoed the president’s speech last week in Illinois , noting that the country had created more jobs under the Obama administration than Europe and Japan combined .Without mentioning their names , Mr. Clinton criticized some of the Republicans running here on such issues as education aid and agriculture . But he also went further than Mr. Pryor had in talking about the new health law , heaping praise on Mr. Beebe for embracing the Affordable Care Act and noting how many Arkansans received health coverage in part because the state expanded Medicaid .Mr. Pryor’s opponent , Representative Tom Cotton , has avoided criticizing Mr. Clinton and used the former president’s return to the state to release a list of “Democrats for Cotton.”“We’re not bothered by President Clinton’s support of Senator Pryor , ” said David Ray , a spokesman for Mr. Cotton . “What bothers us , and should bother all Arkansans , is Senator Pryor’s lock-step support of President Obama’s agenda , which he has supported 93 percent of the time , including on Obamacare , the failed stimulus bill , the Wall Street bailout , judicial nominees , you name it.”Mr. Clinton’s visit to the two campuses was the first leg of a two-day tour . He and the Democrats will make two more stops Tuesday in Northwest Arkansas , including at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville . Democrats here are dedicated to pushing voter turnout beyond what is typical in nonpresidential years and want to use the former president’s visit to engage college students . At both stops Monday , campaign staff members with clipboards signed up students after the rallies .“We’ve registered almost 100,000 new voters , ” Mr. Ross said .Democrats have also been helped by outside spending , but Mr. Clinton made no mention of that as he mocked third-party Republican groups for trying to portray Mr. Pryor as a liberal . ( “He’s up there with Mao Zedong and all the left-wing crazies , ” Mr. Clinton joked in Jonesboro . )The “super PACs , ” Mr. Clinton told the students , have no investment in their lives .“I get really steamed when I see all these out-of-state television ads from people that don’t give a rip about Arkansas , don’t know the difference between Jonesboro and Paragould , couldn’t find Hope if their life depended on it.”Even though he now lives in Chappaqua , N.Y. , and Washington , Mr. Clinton repeatedly stated his affinity for Arkansas and gently mocked reporters who wondered why he is so fixated on politics here .“I plead guilty . I’m obsessed with you , ” he told the Arkansas State students . “I love you and I want the best.”

Jonathan Chait concludes a post on the Republican Party’s obvious desire to avoid formulating a serious alternative to Obamacare by expressing bafflement at the various conservative pundits who have been urging the G.O.P . to advance one:… [ since ] the actual [ Republican ] plan is first to get rid of Obamacare , then pretend to work on a replacement before eventually discovering that it’s expensive and unpopular … the only interesting question here on any level is why so many conservatives feel bound to pretend that the Republicans really are going to formulate some other plan to care for the poor and sick .Josh Barro made a similar point in a back-and-forth with Reihan Salam:The alternative to PPACA is nothing . Mitch McConnell’s comments last weekend were instructive — Republicans in Congress have no meaningful plan to replace Obamacare and think that 30 million uninsured Americans is “not the issue.”Conservative health wonks will object to my characterization . They will say they have many plans to use markets to drive down costs so that affordability is less of an issue . They may even advance plans that spend money to subsidize some sort of coverage for some expanded group of Americans . But Republicans have not taken them up on those plans when they have had the chance .As readers of my Sunday column know , I think Chait and Barro are basically right about the Republican Party’s approach to health care reform in the age of Obama . But under those circumstances , what would they have conservative health wonks and pundits do ? Its leaders’ preference for non-action and evasion notwithstanding , the G.O.P . remains the most plausible institutional vehicle for conservative ideas about health care , and Republican politicians are ( for the most part ) the only political figures capable of delivering the kind of reforms that right-of-center wonks and commentators want . So what Chait describes as the peculiar conservative pretense that “Republicans really are going to formulate some other plan” would be better described as the much-more-understandable conservative desire to persuade Republicans to embrace some other plan . There’s no guarantee that this attempt will succeed ( I’m certainly not wildly optimistic ) , but such attempts are part of the legitimate work of punditry — the point of which isn’t just to describe the world , after all , but to try to change it as well . And as Salam notes in an extended response to Barro’s post , parties do change : To take a relevant example , thanks to Paul Ryan and others , Republicans have become steadily less evasive about Medicare reform over the last few years , and it isn’t crazy to think that the encouragement Congressional Republicans received from right-of-center pundits ( as well as the occasional critique ! ) played some modest role in this evolution . Given that Ryan , Tom Coburn and others are currently at least somewhat more serious about Obamacare alternatives than the party as a whole , I don’t see any reason why conservative commentators can’t hope that the same process will play itself out if and when the G.O.P . is actually confronted with a repeal-and-replace scenario .Whether it does will ultimately be up to a hypothetical President Mitt Romney , of course , but that’s all the more reason for conservatives to seize the opportunity today to advance ideas for what a Romney-led party might do tomorrow . Experience suggests they may not go anywhere — but if pundits were required to always choose experience over hope , we’d all have a lot less to write about .

Jonathan Cohn has a useful , comprehensive summary of what we now know about premiums under Obamacare , and does a very good job of keeping his temper in the face of the obscurantists . As I read it , however , I found myself hankering for a simple way to characterize what’s going on . So I’d like to throw out a stylized diagram , which looks like this:Remember the three-legged stool : the same policies available to everyone , regardless of preexisting conditions , the mandate , so that almost everyone ( we hope ) joins the risk pool , and subsidies to make insurance affordable to those with lower incomes . Who loses under this system — that is , who is better off with the present non-system ? Well , if you’re very healthy you might be able to get a cheap policy now , or feel reasonably secure going without insurance . Under Obamacare , someone blessed with good health might find his ( or , more rarely , her ) premiums going up , and if he’s wealthy as well as healthy he might not get much if anything in the way of subsidies ( and if he’s very wealthy he’ll face new taxes ) . So we’ve know all along that there were going to be at least some people in the northeast corner of my box , doing worse under the new system . The question has always been , how many ?It’s not an easy question to answer , even now — but all the evidence coming in suggests that my dotted line is further up and to the right than previously believed , implying fewer losers and more winners from Obamacare .How have the right’s health pundits responded ? Not with contrary evidence , but by telling us things we already knew , and pretending that they are startling and destructive revelations . Some of it simply amounts to saying that there are indeed some people in the northeast corner of my box . Not everyone wins from the policy ! Well , duh .But at least that’s a valid comparison . The other main argument is that if you look at average premiums under Obamacare , they will be higher than the premiums currently paid by young , healthy people in states without community rating . Again , well duh : insurers are now going to be covering people with health problems who weren’t covered before , so it would be a miracle if the premiums they charged were the same . It is , as Ezra Klein has said , a comparison of apples with oranges you might not even have been allowed to buy .The thing is , supporters of Obamacare could have been negatively surprised by the premium results . Some people were clearly going to win , but if the bids had come in high both the number of losers and the cost of the subsidies would be looking uncomfortably high . As it turns out , however , the news is looking pretty good .
Joni Ernst , the Iowa state senator and Iraq War veteran , was standing in a barn in a purple flannel shirt and an unzipped vest . Beside her , various swine burrowed in the hog lot ; two small pigs spooned ; there was copious squealing . When Ernst , who grew up on a farm castrating hogs , opened her mouth to speak , she drew the inevitable connection between her upbringing and her current role as a Republican candidate for the United States Senate . “When I get to Washington , I’ll know how to cut pork , ” Ernst said , smiling . Title cards reinforced her credentials . ( “Joni Ernst : Mother . Soldier . Conservative.” ) “I’m Joni Ernst , and I approve this message because Washington is full of big spenders . Let’s make ‘em squeal.”The 30-second spot , titled “Squeal , ” was part of a trilogy of ads for the candidate released earlier this year . In another , Ernst , enrobed in a biker jacket , rides a Harley-Davidson to a gun range . ( “Joni Ernst : Set Sights on Obamacare” ) . In a third , titled “Biscuits , ” the camera focuses on a man’s hands as they add butter to flour and use molds to cut circles . “When I was working fast food , I learned the key to a great biscuit is lots of fat , ” Ernst tells the camera . “Problem is , Washington thinks the same thing about our budget.”Ernst is not the only candidate to have brought such a Capra-esque advertising strategy to this year’s midterm elections . Something Else Strategies , the media-consulting firm responsible for “Squeal , ” also masterminded a widely noted spot for the Republican Mike McFadden , who is challenging Al Franken for his Senate seat in Minnesota . McFadden , a former college-football player who now coaches a youth team , recruited his players to appear in a “Bad News Bears '' -style spot in which they mess up handoffs ( “Washington is fumbling our future” ) and clobber each other ( “Obamacare needs to be sacked” ) before the coach rouses them to “get out there and hit somebody.” At that point , for no particular reason , one player hits him below the belt , leaving the coach to recite the “I’m Mike McFadden , and I approve this message” bit in a high-pitched squeal — the universal signifier of a guy who has just been hit in his junk .Critics of the McFadden ad questioned whether such a joke might fall beneath the dignity of a prospective United States senator . A McFadden spokesman earnestly responded that the hit , in fact , landed “in the gut” and that the candidate’s falsetto resulted from having the wind knocked out of him . ( To be fair , no one browbeat Bob Quast , an Independent Senate candidate in Iowa , after his ad warned potential home intruders that he would “use my Glock to blow your balls off.” ) But the critics were missing a crucial point . McFadden , a former investment banker with a law degree from Georgetown , was debasing not only his opponent but also , quite explicitly , himself . He’s in good company . “Somebody once said if you want a friend in Washington , get a dog , ” John Barrow , the deep-drawling , flannel-shirted Democratic congressman from Georgia , recently told the camera as he threw a tennis ball to a golden retriever . “Well , I wouldn’t wish Washington on a dog.” Left unsaid , of course , is why the Harvard Law graduate is running for the punishment of spending his sixth term in the capital . “Barrow is great at filming campaign ads , ” says David Wasserman , who tracks House races for The Cook Political Report . “He is especially great at bumpkinizing.”As we have often been reminded , this was supposed to be a very important election cycle . The Republicans’ hopes of retaking the Senate could easily hinge on squeaker races like Ernst’s in Iowa . This , along with the possibility of padding their majority in the House , would be a significant development for the nation , just as the issues loom huge , complex and ISIS-Ebola scary . And yet countless candidates seem determined to tout their fitness for these enormous challenges by trying to out-bumpkin one another . This spring , Ernst’s opponent , Bruce Braley , a four-term congressman , assured voters that he “grew up doing farm jobs and working a grain elevator.”There is , of course , a delicate art to bumpkinizing . Republicans , in particular , have been burned in recent Senate elections by nominating candidates — Christine O’Donnell , for instance , or Todd Akin — who turned out to be too bumpkin for their own good and imploded in winnable races . This time around , the strategy has been tweaked : If you want to come off as an amateur , it’s helpful to be a pro of some sort . One of the year’s more unlikely populist heroes , after all , is a cowboy poet from South Dakota named Larry Pressler . This Washington outsider , who is running for Senate as an Independent , also happens to be a former Republican senator and a lobbyist who has considered running for mayor of Washington .Skilled politicians have a proud tradition of conveying utter contempt for their profession , especially when they’re running to keep their jobs . This is , to some degree , rooted in our history . As they drafted the Constitution , the founding fathers envisioned that their new republic would be governed by a temporary leadership class of farmers , doctors and assorted commoners who would retain close ties to their communities . Self-styled feisty populists , like Andrew Jackson , tended to denigrate the well-bred qualities of their opponents . “Andrew Jackson , who can fight” was how the decorated general sold himself in the 1828 presidential campaign , compared with “John Quincy Adams , who can write.” Jackson , who in fact was a wealthy and experienced politician , won easily .The historian Garry Wills has referred to this entrenched American tendency as “the glorification of the amateur and contempt for the professional.” This dynamic was heightened during the 1960s , and even more so after Watergate , when an increasingly antiestablishment electorate gravitated toward candidates who could prove that they had no link to the professional order . The 75 new Democrats who were elected to Congress in 1974 — the so-called Watergate babies — swept in largely on a promise to overturn “traditional” politics . The Republican House overthrow of 1994 , in response to Bill Clinton’s shaky first couple of years , was grounded in fashioning a class of 73 anti-Washington Washingtonians . Led by Newt Gingrich , nearly all of them were committed to term limits and to spending as little time in Washington as possible . ( For the record , many of them are still there . )The apotheosis of the modern bumpkin mode has been embodied by Sarah Palin , who nearly found herself one 72-year-old heartbeat from our highest national office . Palin , the starkest example yet of a proud unsophisticate taking the national stage , has remained visible and unapologetic . She also appears to have made little attempt to fill the knowledge gaps she demonstrated in 2008 or to shed her association with reality-TV-style family dramas , like the recent drunken brawl she apparently observed at an Anchorage birthday party . According to Alan Schroeder , a professor of journalism at Northeastern University and an expert on the celebrity aspects of politics , Palin has come to represent “a new standard of the slim résumé.”Palin may have had a rare talent , if somewhat limited appeal , but the outsider streak of this year’s midterms comes in response to a unique and distinctly awful political landscape . Not only is President Obama’s popularity in free fall , but whatever Everyman credibility he mustered during his “Washington Outsider” candidacy in 2008 has long since been dissipated through the regal isolation of his office and the suspicion that he is aloof and presumably ill equipped at castrating hogs . He is , in other words , politically toxic . Braley was willing to abide a visit on his behalf from Michelle Obama , but he undoubtedly benefited from the fact that the first lady repeatedly mispronounced his name as “Bailey.”Candidates themselves don’t deserve all the blame for their bumpkinizing . Much of that rests with the blizzards of money being blown from wealthy donors and super PACs to a growing oligarchy of media consultants , who typically live on the coasts and work for multiple candidates at once . In a D.C. twist , those bumpkins we see on our screens are often not even real bumpkins so much as some rich guy’s idea of what a bumpkin should be . One telltale signal is how familiar the props are — the livestock , the guns , the motorcycles , the dogs and , of course , the flannel . An ad for Rob Maness , a Louisiana Republican running for the Senate , features a trifecta : a gun , an airboat and an alligator .In large part , this is what we have to show for the nearly $ 4 billion that is expected to be spent in this campaign , the most of any midterm election in history . “When you have this much outside spending , way too much of the advertising has no soul , ” acknowledged Todd Harris , a partner at Something Else Strategies , who is based in Washington , far from his clients Ernst and McFadden . The people who are creating these spots , in other words , don’t have much connection to the state they’re working in . It’s a good bet that few at Something Else Strategies have spent much time on hog farms . They are paid either way .I was thinking about the 2014 midterms as I rewatched “Mr . Smith Goes to Washington , ” the classic Frank Capra movie that celebrated its 75th anniversary last month . In a sense , Jefferson Smith , the plucked-from-nowhere senator played by Jimmy Stewart , came to represent the ideal of the pure-hearted Washington bumpkin . Mr. Smith is a naïve outsider with quirky habits ( he trains pigeons ! ) and a determination to live up to the ideals embodied by the monuments he so admired . His capacity for umbrage at the corrupt ways of his colleagues and the press made him an admirable foil . Likewise , he willingly engaged in a filibuster for 24 hours — just like the highflying outsiders of recent cycles , Ted Cruz and Rand Paul .But Smith’s antics are actually geared toward pending legislation . He does not care about getting attention , let alone harbor any ambition of running for president . In real life , Cruz and Paul have no background in legislating or have shown no interest in it , in part because it might taint them as Washington “professionals” in places like Iowa .Meantime , as Election Day loomed , Joni Ernst returned to her roots . In late October , as she held onto a narrow margin , her campaign released a new ad featuring the candidate in another flannel shirt and vest , surrounded by still more snorting pigs . “Dirty , noisy , and it stinks , ” Ernst complains . “Not this lot — I’m talking about the one in Washington.” Her campaign issued a statement assuring everyone that the ad featured the same hogs that appeared in “Squeal , ” “although they’re older and bigger now.” It was also produced by the same media consultants , who are also older now and , presumably , richer too .
Just hours before the government was set to shut down , President Obama called House Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio , according to a spokesman for Mr. Boehner . But it did not appear they resolved much of anything .“The president called the speaker this evening to discuss funding for the government and Obamacare , ” said Brendan Buck , a Boehner spokesman . “The speaker told the president that Obamacare is costing jobs and that American families are being denied basic fairness when big businesses are getting exemptions that they are not.”The call lasted nearly 10 minutes .
Just one more reminder of what a victory Obama and Pelosi pulled off : here’s the Intrade price on passage of Obamacare from the aftermath of the Massachusetts election to actual success:
KNOXVILLE Tenn. ( Reuters ) - An outgoing Tennessee lawmaker representing a Knoxville district admitted on Friday to sending a ridiculing message on social media to a newly laid-off political reporter .State Senator Stacey Campfield , a Republican , confirmed that he sent a public Facebook message on Thursday that said , “so , Do YOU have any comments now ? ” to Cari Wade Gervin , a former government reporter for Knoxville’s Metro Pulse .Gervin , along with the entire staff of the 23-year-old alternative weekly newspaper , was laid off this week by the Knoxville News Sentinel , owned by E.W . Scripps Co .Campfield and Gervin had a rivalry dating back years , with Gervin’s paper often reporting on Campfield , who once equated Obamacare to the Nazis and for sponsoring anti-gay legislation .“It’s just sad because he’s attacking me at this awful time . He’s just doing it because he wants attention before he leaves office , ” said a tearful Gervin , 37 , who has worked at the paper for four years .Campfield , who recently lost a contentious primary race for his seat in Knoxville , served as a lightning rod for controversy during his roughly 10 years of public service as both a representative and a senator in the Tennessee legislature .Campfield said on Friday that Gervin had lied about him in the past .“Do I care about someone who lost their job lying about me ? No , ” he told Reuters .( Reporting by Les Neuhaus in Knoxville ; Editing by Brendan O'Brien and Eric Beech )
LAS VEGAS — President Barack Obama defended his decision to bypass Congress and overhaul U.S. immigration policy on his own on Friday , saying he was forced to act because House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner would not let legislation come to a vote .With many Americans skeptical of his decision to bypass Congress and impose an immigration overhaul unilaterally , Obama attempted to rally support for his move in a speech at a Las Vegas high school , saying illegal immigrants need a chance to come out of the shadows .He engaged in a cross-country debate with Boehner , the top U.S. Republican , who accused Obama in Washington of sabotaging chances for bipartisan legislation and vowed to lead a fight to block his executive actions .In the summer of 2013 , the Democratic-run Senate passed compromise immigration legislation but the bill died in the Republican-controlled House . Obama said he waited to see if the House would ever pass the legislation , but Boehner would not let it come to a vote .`` I told John Boehner , 'I 'll wash your car , walk your dog , whatever you need to do , just call the bill , '' Obama said . `` And he did n't do it . ''To those lawmakers who feel he overstepped his constitutional authority , Obama said his message to them is : `` Pass the bill . ''Obama 's move threatens to herald a new round of partisan gridlock in Washington as Republicans who will control both chambers of Congress in January react with scorn to his decision .Republicans remain split on the best course of resistance to Obama 's action easing the threat of deportation for some 4.7 million undocumented immigrants . Conservative groups were already pulling together legal strategies to challenge it .`` With this action , the president has chosen to deliberately sabotage any chance of enacting bipartisan reforms that he claims to seek . And as I told the president yesterday , he 's damaging the presidency itself , '' Boehner told reporters .`` We 're working with our members and looking at the options available to us , '' he said . `` But I will say to you , the House will , in fact , act . ''Obama received a rousing welcome from a largely Latino audience at Del Sol High School in Las Vegas , the same place he visited just after beginning his second term in 2013 , when he laid out his principles for immigration reform .`` Si se puede , '' they chanted .A heckler shouted at Obama that his order did not go far enough . Obama engaged him from across the high school gym .`` I 've heard you , young man , I’ve heard you . But what I’m saying is that this is just a first step , '' Obama told him .Outside , a couple of dozen protesters who opposed his actions shouted slogans and held up signs that said : `` Stop Obama Amnesty . ''Before getting off Air Force One shortly after landing in Las Vegas , Obama signed two presidential memoranda to set in motion part of the biggest U.S. immigration changes in a decade .Just hours after his speech on Thursday night , Republicans launched a long-threatened lawsuit against the administration on another topic , accusing it of abusing executive authority through implementation of the president 's `` Obamacare '' health reform law .Republicans have said in recent weeks they would consider adding a challenge to the Obama immigration order to the healthcare lawsuit .But the most prominent strategy under consideration , supported by many conservatives in Congress , is to withhold funds for implementation of the immigration order from a major spending bill needed to fund the government by Dec. 11 .A fight over the spending bill could lead to another shutdown of federal agencies , one year after a 16-day closure that inflicted heavy political damage on Republicans .`` We do need to find a way to really push back , '' Republican Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama , who has called for using the spending bill as a vehicle to challenge the order , said at the Heritage Foundation .Other Republicans have suggested a range of options , from opposing all of Obama 's nominees unless he relents , to stand-alone legislation undoing the order and even impeachment .( Additional reporting by Emily Stephenson , David Lawder and Amanda Becker in Washington ; Editing by John Whitesides and Tom Brown )
LAST month , for the 37th time , the House of Representatives voted to repeal Obamacare , with many Republicans saying that its call for greater government involvement in the health care system spells doom . Yet most other industrial countries have health care systems with far more government involvement than we are ever likely to see under Obamacare . What does their experience tell us about Republican fears ?While in Sweden this month as a visiting scholar , Iâve asked several Swedish health economists to share their thoughts about that question . They have spent their lives under a system in which most health care providers work directly for the government . Like economists in most other countries , they tend to be skeptical of large bureaucracies . So if extensive government involvement in health care is indeed a recipe for doom , they should have clear evidence of that by now .Yet none of them voiced the kinds of complaints about recalcitrant bureaucrats and runaway health costs that invariably surface in similar conversations with American colleagues . Little wonder . The Swedish system performs superbly , and my Swedish colleagues cited evidence of that fact with obvious pride .The United States spends more than $ 8,000 a person per year on health care , well more than twice what Sweden spends . Yet health outcomes are far better in Sweden along virtually every dimension . Its infant mortality rate , for example , was recently less than half that of the United States . And males aged 15 to 60 are almost twice as likely to die in any given year in the United States than in Sweden .In fairness , those differences result partly from lifestyle . In Sweden , workers are more likely to commute by bicycle than by car , for example , and obesity is far less common . Absolute poverty and income inequality â both associated with adverse health outcomes â are also lower .But when illness strikes , the Swedish health care system responds efficiently . Managers have exploited economies of scale by consolidating services into fewer but larger hospitals . The American system has also gone through consolidation , but , by contrast , boutique hospitals are also more common here â partly in response to demands from patients with very high-cost health plans . In large hospitals , CT scanners and other expensive diagnostic and treatment machines are in nearly constant use , versus only a few hours of weekly use in some small ones .Larger hospitals with heavier patient flows also enable their staff to hone their skills through specialization and experience . If you are getting a knee replacement or coronary bypass surgery , you want teams that do scores of such procedures each month .Doctors in the two countries also face different financial incentives . In the United States , under the fee-for-service model , they can bolster their incomes , often substantially , by prescribing additional tests and procedures . Most Swedish doctors , as salaried employees , have no comparable incentive .Another important difference is that , unlike many American health insurance providers , the government groups that manage Swedish health care are nonprofit entities . Because their charge is to provide quality care for all citizens , they donât face the same incentive to withhold care that for-profit organizations do . That more hip-replacement operations are performed per capita in Sweden than in most other countries is almost certainly a reflection of the generous care options rather than of any inherent deficiency in Swedesâ hip joints .The Swedes also provide drugs and other treatments only when evidence establishes their effectiveness . People can spend privately on unproven treatments , but the government refuses to impose their cost on taxpayers .IS there a catch ? When I asked my Swedish hosts to describe any downsides to their system , several mentioned the waiting times for certain nonemergency services . One told me that whereas in the United States a wealthy or well-insured patient might schedule a hip replacement with only a weekâs notice , in Sweden the wait could be as long as three months . He described such waits as a design feature , noting that they allowed facilities to be used at consistently high capacity , and thus more efficiently .Obamacare also contains many evidence-based provisions for medication and other treatments . But at least in its initial stages , it will not be able to match the cost savings achieved in Sweden .Thatâs because the legislationâs design was heavily constrained from the outset . Surveys showed that most Americans were satisfied with the existing health plans provided by their employers , so any new system that required people to abandon them would have been a political non-starter . As I discussed in an earlier column , however , such plans are an extremely inefficient way to pay for health care . They arose as an unfortunate historical accident during World War II , when employers used them to sidestep the wage controls that had resulted in extreme labor shortages .Employer health plans have been disappearing steadily , and may one day be gone entirely . The encouraging news is that the Affordable Care Act was intended to foster the evolution of a new system that can capture many of the gains currently enjoyed by countries like Sweden .For that to happen , however , Congressional critics must abandon their futile efforts to repeal Obamacare and focus instead on improving it . Their core premise â that greater government involvement in health care provision spells disaster â lacks support in the wealth of evidence from around the world that bears on it .The truth appears closer to the reverse : Because of pervasive market failures in private health care markets , this may be the sector that benefits most from collective action .
LEESBURG , Va. — As thousands of people gathered on a sweltering night outside a local high school draped with flags and bunting , the speaker talked about the president’s controversial health program . “That’s why he passed Obamacare ! ” she declared .There it was , the derogatory term critics invented for President Obama’s health law , more properly known as the Affordable Care Act of 2010 . Republicans long ago successfully pasted the president’s name on the program to deride it as a big-government boondoggle . But now an unlikely group has adopted the moniker : Democrats .The speaker here in Virginia the other night , introducing Mr. Obama at a campaign rally , was not using the term as an insult . And she was not the only one to do that lately . Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. used the word in a recent fund-raising e-mail . Even Mr. Obama has been picking up the term , reinterpreting the meaning of Obamacare .“You know what ? ” he told a crowd of supporters in Texas recently . “They’re right . I do care.”Whether Democrats can change a pejorative into a positive is unclear , but after three years on the defensive , they have resigned themselves to the fact that “Obamacare” has become the popular name for the sweeping social program , and they are trying to spin it in their direction . Particularly since the Supreme Court upheld the law’s constitutionality , Mr. Obama and his allies have tried to take ownership of the term .“The right created it and spits it out as an epithet ; it has that tone , a sneering quality like they’re hanging it around his neck , ” said Jeff Shesol , a former White House speechwriter under President Bill Clinton . “But it has so taken hold , it reached that level of saturation that it’s very difficult for Obama or the Democrats to escape it . So why not then try to appropriate it ? ”Some of those on the other side have been surprised at how the term has become the de facto name of the program .“I never thought it would stick , ” said Frank Luntz , a Republican strategist who was among those who encouraged its use in the early days . “People want health care personalized , not politicized , and the phrase Obamacare is an effective way to communicate the politicization of health care.”Critics have often found catchy phrases to brand programs they opposed , from the time of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal to Lyndon B. Johnson’s Great Society , but they did not generally use the president’s name as part of it . During Johnson’s presidency , critics labeled Medicare “socialized medicine.”“That was enough to make it intrinsically un-American for many in the growing conservative movement , ” said Mark K. Updegrove , director of the Lyndon B. Johnson Library and Museum .By the 1980s , though , that had changed . Ronald Reagan’s program of tax cutting and military spending was labeled Reaganomics as if to emphasize its difference from mainstream economics , but his supporters came to embrace the term . Same with Clintonomics during the 1990s . Still , Hillarycare , like Hillary Rodham Clinton’s health care program itself , never was seen as a positive .The tax cuts passed under President George W. Bush had no such shorthand name , but there is a reason Democrats even now never speak of them without calling them “the Bush tax cuts.” Mr. Bush himself expressed regret about that this spring amid the latest debate over whether to keep them in place , recognizing that his name made them a political target and therefore less likely to be renewed . “I wish they weren’t called the Bush tax cuts , ” he said .The expression Obamacare first was used in early 2007 , according to research by Elspeth Reeve at The Atlantic magazine , generally by writers describing the candidate’s proposal for expanding coverage for the uninsured . The first use of it by a political figure she found was actually in September 2007 by none other than former Gov .

LEESBURG , Va. — As thousands of people gathered on a sweltering night outside a local high school draped with flags and bunting , the speaker talked about the president’s controversial health program . “That’s why he passed Obamacare ! ” she declared .There it was , the derogatory term critics invented for President Obama’s health law , more properly known as the Affordable Care Act of 2010 . Republicans long ago successfully pasted the president’s name on the program to deride it as a big-government boondoggle . But now an unlikely group has adopted the moniker : Democrats .The speaker here in Virginia the other night , introducing Mr. Obama at a campaign rally , was not using the term as an insult . And she was not the only one to do that lately . Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. used the word in a recent fund-raising e-mail . Even Mr. Obama has been picking up the term , reinterpreting the meaning of Obamacare .“You know what ? ” he told a crowd of supporters in Texas recently . “They’re right . I do care.”Whether Democrats can change a pejorative into a positive is unclear , but after three years on the defensive , they have resigned themselves to the fact that “Obamacare” has become the popular name for the sweeping social program , and they are trying to spin it in their direction . Particularly since the Supreme Court upheld the law’s constitutionality , Mr. Obama and his allies have tried to take ownership of the term .“The right created it and spits it out as an epithet ; it has that tone , a sneering quality like they’re hanging it around his neck , ” said Jeff Shesol , a former White House speechwriter under President Bill Clinton . “But it has so taken hold , it reached that level of saturation that it’s very difficult for Obama or the Democrats to escape it . So why not then try to appropriate it ? ”Some of those on the other side have been surprised at how the term has become the de facto name of the program .“I never thought it would stick , ” said Frank Luntz , a Republican strategist who was among those who encouraged its use in the early days . “People want health care personalized , not politicized , and the phrase Obamacare is an effective way to communicate the politicization of health care.”Critics have often found catchy phrases to brand programs they opposed , from the time of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal to Lyndon B. Johnson’s Great Society , but they did not generally use the president’s name as part of it . During Johnson’s presidency , critics labeled Medicare “socialized medicine.”“That was enough to make it intrinsically un-American for many in the growing conservative movement , ” said Mark K. Updegrove , director of the Lyndon B. Johnson Library and Museum .By the 1980s , though , that had changed . Ronald Reagan’s program of tax cutting and military spending was labeled Reaganomics as if to emphasize its difference from mainstream economics , but his supporters came to embrace the term . Same with Clintonomics during the 1990s . Still , Hillarycare , like Hillary Rodham Clinton’s health care program itself , never was seen as a positive .The tax cuts passed under President George W. Bush had no such shorthand name , but there is a reason Democrats even now never speak of them without calling them “the Bush tax cuts.” Mr. Bush himself expressed regret about that this spring amid the latest debate over whether to keep them in place , recognizing that his name made them a political target and therefore less likely to be renewed . “I wish they weren’t called the Bush tax cuts , ” he said .The expression Obamacare first was used in early 2007 , according to research by Elspeth Reeve at The Atlantic magazine , generally by writers describing the candidate’s proposal for expanding coverage for the uninsured .

LEXINGTON , Ky. — In a debate at close quarters , Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes vowed Monday night to be independent of President Barack Obama if she wins Kentucky 's close and costly Senate race , but Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said his rival hopes to deceive voters about her intentions .Despite her pledge , Grimes stuck to her days-long refusal to say if she voted for Obama in 2008 and 2012 . She insisted that if she answered the question , it would `` compromise a constitutional right '' to cast a secret ballot .McConnell quickly scoffed at that . `` There 's no sacred right to not announce how you voted , '' he said , seated next to Grimes for an hour-long debate hosted by KET , the state 's public television station . `` I voted for Mitt Romney proudly . I voted for John McCain , '' he added , referring to the two men Obama defeated .The race is one of several that will determine if Republicans capture a Senate majority in midterm elections . They need to pick up six seats to prevail , and a GOP triumph would all-but-certainly make McConnell the new majority leader , with the power to set the Senate 's legislative agenda during the last two years of Obama 's presidency .The contest is also one of the most expensive in the country , with millions of dollars in television commercials aired by the candidates , their parties and allies focused on Senate races nationally . McConnell also has benefited from about $ 20 million in advertisements from a pair of organizations set up by former aides and associates solely to re-elect him to a sixth term .McConnell and Grimes disagreed sharply about the minimum wage , coal , trade and the health care law . McConnell , who has led the charge in the Senate to repeal the law known as Obamacare , said it 's all right with him if Kentucky wants to continue an expansion of care for low-income residents set up as part of the program .Side by side with McConnell for the only time in their race , Grimes offered several possible labels for the 30-year Senate veteran — `` Senator no-show , Senator gridlock and Senator shutdown . ''McConnell countered that as Senate Republican leader , he has been involved in the major bipartisan deals that have been reached in the past four years of divided government .He also said that despite her attempts to establish political independence from the president , Grimes was a delegate to Democratic National Conventions in 2008 and 2012 , when some Democratic office-holders stayed away . `` She 's made a major effort to deceive the people of Kentucky , '' he said .But Grimes said she has disagreements with Obama , adding , `` the president is not on the ballot this year . It 's myself and Sen . McConnell . ''Grimes said repeatedly the minimum wage should be raised , and said if it were , at least a million Americans would be better off . McConnell countered that a study by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office said it would cause the loss of between 500,000 and one million jobs .McConnell also sharply rebuked Grimes when she said he has become wealthy while in the Senate `` on the backs of hard-working Kentuckians . '' The five-term senator said an independent fact-checker had debunked her claim , and said the bulk of his increase in wealth over three decades came from an inheritance by his wife , former Labor Secretary Elaine Chao , and from her employment .The president is highly unpopular in Kentucky , and Grimes has spent months and millions in advertising money trying to establish her political independence from him .McConnell , whose own poll ratings are poor after 30 years in office , has worked nonstop to cast his rival as a certain ally of the administration .Both candidates unveiled new television ads in the hours before the debate .Grimes ' commercial featured retired Democratic Sen. Wendell Ford , who said McConnell `` is Mr. No , '' and said that unlike the incumbent , the challenger wo n't vote to send jobs overseas .McConnell 's ad showed Chuck Todd , an NBC newsman who moderates Meet The Press , saying earlier in the week , `` I think she ( Grimes ) disqualified herself '' by not saying who she voted for .Grimes , 35 , was recruited by the Democratic party nationally to run , and got off to a fast start while McConnell , 72 , was bogged down in a costly primary race with tea party rival Matt Bevin .Grimes and McConnell both won their primaries with ease in mid-May , at a time the Democratic challenger was ahead in most if not all of the public polls . She soon came under a withering barrage of televised attacks , though . In recent weeks , her favorability has eroded in public surveys , many of which show McConnell with a slender advantage in a very tight race .The debate 's sponsors did not allow still photographers or reporters into the studio during the event , preventing them from capturing the full context of how the candidates performed outside the view of KET 's cameras .
LISTENING to the debate about President Obamaâs health care plan , some critics argue that Obamacare is going to need Obamacare â because itâs going to be a âtrain wreck.â Obama officials insist theyâre wrong . Weâll just have to wait and see whether the Affordable Care Act , as the health care law is officially known , surprises us on the downside . But there is one area where the law already appears to be surprising on the upside . And that is the number of health care information start-ups itâs spurring . This is a big deal .The combination of Obamacare regulations , incentives in the recovery act for doctors and hospitals to shift to electronic records and the releasing of mountains of data held by the Department of Health and Human Services is creating a new marketplace and platform for innovation â a health care Silicon Valley â that has the potential to create better outcomes at lower costs by changing how health data are stored , shared and mined . Itâs a new industry .Obamacare is based on the notion that a main reason we pay so much more than any other industrial nation for health care , without better results , is because the incentive structure in our system is wrong . Doctors and hospitals are paid primarily for procedures and tests , not health outcomes . The goal of the health care law is to flip this fee-for-services system ( which some insurance companies are emulating ) to one where the government pays doctors and hospitals to keep Medicare patients healthy and the services they do render are reimbursed more for their value than volume .To do this , though , doctors and hospitals need instant access to data about patients â diagnoses , medications , test results , procedures and potential gaps in care that need to be addressed . As long as this information was stuffed into manila folders in doctorsâ offices and hospitals , and not turned into electronic records , it was difficult to execute these kinds of analyses . That is changing . According to the Obama administration , thanks to incentives in the recovery act there has been nearly a tripling since 2008 of electronic records installed by office-based physicians , and a quadrupling by hospitals .The Health and Human Services Department connected me with some start-ups and doctors whoâve benefited from all this , including Dr. Jen Brull , a family medicine specialist in Plainville , Kan. , who said that she was certain she had been alerting her relevant patients to have colorectal cancer screening â until she looked at the data in her new electronic health care system and discovered that only 43 percent of those who should be getting the screening had done so . She improved it to 90 percent by installing alerts in her electronic health records , and this led to the early detection of cancer in three patients â and early surgery that saved these patientsâ lives and also substantial health care expense .Todd Park , the White Houseâs chief technology officer , said many new apps being developed have been further fueled by the decision by Health and Human Services to make available massive amounts data that it had gathered over the years but had largely not been accessible in computer readable forms that could be used to improve health care.ÂIt started in March 2010 when Health and Human Services met with â45 rather skeptical entrepreneurs , â said Park , âand rather meekly put an initial pile of H.H.S . data in front of them â aggregate data on hospital quality , nursing home patient satisfaction and regional health care system performance . We asked the entrepreneurs what , if anything , they might be able to do with this data , if we made it supereasy to find , download and use.â They were told that in 90 days the department would hold a âHealth Datapalooza , â â a public event to showcase innovators who harnessed the power of this data to improve health and care .Ninety days later , entrepreneurs showed up and demonstrated more than 20 new or upgraded apps they had built that leveraged open data to do everything from helping patients find the best health care providers to enabling health care leaders to better understand patterns of health care system performance across communities , said Park . In 2012 , another âHealth Datapaloozaâ was held , and this time , he added , â1,600 entrepreneurs and innovators packed into rooms at the Washington Convention Center , hearing presentations from about 100 companies who were selected from a field of over 230 companies who had applied to present.â Most had been started in the last 24 months .Among the start-ups I met with are Eviti , which uses technology to help cancer patients get the right combination of drugs or radiation from Day 1 , which can lower costs and improve outcomes ; Teladoc , which takes unused slices of doctorsâ time and makes use of it by connecting them with remote patients , reducing visits to emergency wards ; Humedica , which helps health care providers analyze their electronic patient records , tracking what was done to a patient , and did they actually get better ; and Lumeris , which does health care analytics that uses real-time data about every aspect of a patientâs care , to improve medical decision-making , collaboration and cost-saving .Obamacare will be a success only if it can deliver improved health care for more people at affordable prices . That remains to be seen . But at least it is already spurring the innovation necessary to make that happen .
LITTLE ROCK , Ark . — U.S. Sen. Mark Pryor reached into his own medical history Tuesday to explain his vote on the nation 's new health care law , telling Arkansans his battle with a rare cancer 18 years ago influenced him .The two-term Democrat , who is in a tough re-election battle , fought a clear-cell sarcoma discovered after a pickup basketball game . He had five weeks of chemotherapy and a 13-hour surgery that his campaign called experimental .`` It makes the argument that much clearer when Sen. Pryor tells his personal story of his battle with his cancer , where he could have easily lost his life , '' Pryor campaign spokesman Erik Dorey said .Pryor , then 33 , was having surgery to repair what was believed to be a basketball injury when doctors found the cancer , which has a high mortality rate .In a 30-second advertisement , Pryor says the experience helped him back a law that prevents insurers from canceling policies if someone gets sick or denying coverage for pre-existing conditions . He does not mention the Affordable Care Act by name .`` No one should be fighting an insurance company while you 're fighting for your life , '' Pryor says in the ad , which is running statewide as part of a six-figure buy .The campaign of his Republican challenger , Rep. Tom Cotton , said it was thankful that Pryor survived his cancer scare and admired his courage .`` We all agree that nobody should be denied coverage due to a pre-existing condition , '' Cotton spokesman David Ray wrote in an email .He said `` Obamacare '' harms the middle class and small businesses and has caused millions to lose existing insurance coverage after being told they could keep it .`` Further , Sen. Pryor has supported a taxpayer-funded bailout of big insurance companies that lose money as a result of 'Obamacare , ' '' Ray wrote . `` We need to start over with reform that makes health care more affordable and keeps health care decisions between patients and doctors . ''The National Institutes of Health , citing small 1992 and 1999 studies , put the five-year survival rate for clear-cell sarcoma at 54 percent . It said the cancer is found primarily in the extremities of young adults .
LITTLE ROCK , Arkansas — As voters head into primaries on Tuesday in the southern swing state of Arkansas , one of the most fiercely debated issues among Republican candidates is the centerpiece healthcare policy of President Barack Obama , a Democrat .A group of Arkansas Republicans are battling for their political lives in primary showdowns with challengers from their own party who are trying to excoriate them for reaching a compromise with Democrats on a state health plan . This plan , aimed at the poor , is called the `` Private Option '' and meant to be an alternate to the Affordable Care Act , or `` Obamacare '' .`` It 's the hot button , '' said Republican state Senator David Sanders of Little Rock .At stake is how far the Republican party will swing to the right in a state where they hold a narrow majority in the House of Representatives . Even Democrats often position themselves as conservative centrists .Republican challengers in state legislative races are targeting incumbent GOP lawmakers who supported their party 's leadership and approved the Private Option .The issue has created far fewer ripples in Democratic races .The Tuesday primary is for Democrats and Republicans with voters casting ballots for candidates to represent the parties for local posts , the statehouse and U.S. Congress in elections in November .The program being hotly debated uses federal Medicaid funds from the Affordable Care Act to help buy health insurance for low-income Arkansas residents , many of whom would otherwise be assigned to Medicaid or have treatment costs absorbed by doctors and other healthcare providers .`` That 's all they 're making it about , the Private Option , '' Sanders said of the Republican challengers .Variations on the Arkansas model have since been adopted or are under consideration in other states including Republican strongholds such as Utah , and battleground states in presidential elections including Pennsylvania , Michigan and Ohio .Opponents in the Arkansas General Assembly said both the Private Option and the Affordable Care Act are too costly and represent an unacceptable expansion of government .The future of the Private Option could also be determined on Tuesday . The Arkansas Senate approved funding for the program this year by a single vote , and three Republican senators who supported it are facing primary opponents .Obamacare will be hanging over one of the state 's marquis races in the general election in November where incumbent U.S . Senator Mark Pryor , a Democrat , has been straining to maintain a lead in the polls over the Republican challenger , U.S. Rep. Tom Cotton , who is supported by the Tea Party .Pryor and Cotton face no serious threats in the primaries .Pryor , who is seeking a third six-year term , voted for the Affordable Care Act . Cotton is a harsh critic of the program .Health care reform also could be a decisive issue in races for two open U.S. House seats in Arkansas now held by Republicans - Cotton , and U.S. Rep. Tim Griffin , who is leaving Congress after two terms .( Reporting by Steve Barnes ; Writing by Jon Herskovitz ; Editing by Scott Malone and Diane Craft )
LITTLE ROCK , Arkansas — The Arkansas House of Representatives voted on Tuesday to fund the state 's so-called `` Private Option '' medical insurance program that has drawn interest from lawmakers in other states as an alternative to Obamacare .The measure , which had earlier passed the state Senate , received 76 votes , one more than necessary in the 100-member House . This ended a more than week-long standoff over the health insurance program for lower-income residents .The Private Option uses $ 915 million in federal Medicaid funds from the Obama Administration 's Affordable Care Act , or Obamacare , to purchase health insurance for employed individuals whose earnings hover just above the federal poverty level .Those with incomes below the poverty line would be routed to the standard Medicaid program .Medicaid is a government program that provides free or low-cost health coverage to low-income citizens . Obamacare requires participants to buy health insurance from a private company or employer . It provides subsidies for those who can not afford insurance but make too much money to qualify for Medicaid .The debate in Arkansas was watched closely by several other states that have adopted the approach or are considering it , including such presidential election swing states as Ohio , Pennsylvania and Michigan .The plan appeals to some conservative lawmakers who want to provide healthcare for the uninsured through the private sector rather than the federal Medicaid program . It also fits the Obama administration 's goal of seeing states use federal Medicaid money to provide insurance for lower-income residents .The Private Option was crafted by Governor Mike Beebe , a Democrat , and Republican legislative leaders .Both houses in the Arkansas legislature are controlled by Republicans opposed to Obamacare but divided on whether the Private Option is a reasonable alternative .A bloc of staunch-conservative Republican lawmakers had stymied the appropriation , complaining that the state 's share of Private Option funding would soon prove too costly .They also said Obamacare was a gross and intrusive expansion of the federal government that would deepen the national debt .About 125,000 low-income Arkansans already have enrolled in the Private Option or have applied .Beebe had warned that failure to fund the plan would destroy his proposed $ 5 billion state budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1 .While expressing opposition to the Affordable Care Act , Beebe defended the hybrid program as `` pragmatic .

LITTLE ROCK Ark . ( Reuters ) - Former President Bill Clinton returned to Arkansas on Monday for two days of rallies aimed at energizing Democratic voters in state political races including a U.S. Senate contest seen as crucial to maintaining the party 's control of that chamber .Arkansas is in the sights of the Republican Party , which is trying to capture the Senate by unseating incumbent Democrats like Mark Pryor of Arkansas .Republicans are also looking to win back the governorship . Democratic Governor Mike Beebe can not seek re-election because of term limits .`` Do n't vote for what you should be against , vote for what you know you should be for , '' Clinton , a long-serving governor of the state , told an outdoor audience at the University of Central Arkansas at Conway , north of Little Rock .Pryor has been attacked by Republicans for his support of President Barack Obama , who is deeply unpopular in the state , and voting for the Affordable Care Act , or Obamacare , also highly unpopular .`` The GOP strategy is to run against Obama , '' said Hal Bass , a professor of political science at Ouachita Baptist University at Arkadelphia , Arkansas . `` The Democrats are trying to make the races less national and more 'Arkan-centric . ' ''Three other events with Clinton , often called the `` Big Dog '' in his home state , were scheduled for Monday and Tuesday , two of them on university campuses and one on the edge of the Arkansas delta , where Democrats hope to maximize turnout among black voters .`` Clinton 's visit will mobilize voters more than it will produce converts , '' Bass said .Clinton , who served as president from 1993 to 2001 , remains very popular among Democrats .The Republicans have also brought in big names , including the party 's 2012 U.S. presidential candidate , Mitt Romney , to rally support . Romney won Arkansas by 24 percentage points in the 2012 presidential race with Obama .Clinton casts a long shadow in Arkansas , with his influence seen in the governor 's race to pick a successor for Beebe , a Democrat .Former U.S. Representative Mike Ross , a former Clinton campaign aide , is running against former Republican U.S. Representative Asa Hutchinson , who helped prosecute the impeachment case against Clinton in 1998 and 1999 .With a month remaining before the election , polls in Arkansas have shown the Republican candidates leading , but within or near the margin of error . Advertising spending in the races for Senate and the governorship has already set records .( Writing by Jon Herskovitz ; Editing by Peter Cooney )
LITTLE ROCK Ark . ( Reuters ) - Former U.S. President Bill Clinton made a renewed push in his home state of Arkansas to boost Democrats in tight local races that also have major national implications as early voting started on Monday in the state .The globe-trotting Clinton , who served six terms as governor , returned to Arkansas over the weekend for the second time in a month , headlining three days of rallies in five cities with substantial African-American populations .Democrats are hoping Clinton will help incumbent U.S . Senator Mark Pryor , who is fighting for his political life against U.S. Representative Tom Cotton , a first-term Republican congressman .Cotton has a slight lead in the race ahead of the Nov. 4 election , several polls have shown .Republicans aim to oust Pryor as they try to take control of the U.S. Senate , seeing him as vulnerable and attacking him for his support of the Affordable Care Act , or `` Obamacare '' , which is deeply unpopular in the state .Cotton has cast Pryor as a tool of current President Barack Obama , who is also deeply unpopular in Arkansas , mentioning `` Obama '' or `` Obamacare '' more than 70 times in each of the two televised debates last week . Pryor has sought to distance himself from Obama , criticizing the president for failing to do enough to combat Ebola in the United States .Analysts said Clinton , who still garners large support at home , is shifting the debate away from the health law and trying to motivate Democratic voters with core party issues , including better access to economic and academic opportunities .`` The key question , of course : Is it enough ? '' said Jay Barth , a professor of political science at Hendrix College in Conway , Arkansas .Clinton rallied party faithful at a Sunday rally in Forrest City , saying : `` If you want lower interest on college loans , if you want more people to go and finish college , if you want preschool for everybody ... you 've got to vote Mark Pryor and Mike Ross . ''Former congressmen Mike Ross , a Democrat , and Asa Hutchinson , the GOP nominee , are battling for governor with incumbent Mike Beebe , a Democrat , who is unable to seek a third term due to term limits .Last week , Democrats received a political victory when the Arkansas Supreme Court struck down the state 's voter ID law , which the party argued was a Republican attempt to suppress votes among poor and minorities , groups who typically support Democrats .( Writing by Jon Herskovitz ; Editing by Susan Heavey )

LITTLE ROCK Ark . ( Reuters ) - The Arkansas race for a seat in the U.S. Senate is nearly a dead heat and almost certain to be the most expensive in the state 's history as Democrats and Republicans pour money into a battle that could help determine the balance of power in the body .Apart from the spending , a tipping point in the campaign could be whether distaste for President Barack Obama outweighs reverence for the Pryor family , a state political power for decades , analysts say .The contest pits two-term Democrat Mark Pryor , an ally of the state 's favorite political son , Bill Clinton , against Rep. Tom Cotton , a Republican who returned to Arkansas only two years ago to win a seat in the House of Representatives .`` It 's a knife fight to the end , '' said Don Tilton , a veteran Little Rock lobbyist . A poll last week showed Cotton slightly ahead , but with a lead smaller than the margin of error for the survey .The campaigns and interest groups already have spent almost $ 12 million on television advertising , a state record for a U.S. Senate race .Former President Clinton , who served as Arkansas governor , has made several appearances in support of Pryor . Mitt Romney , the 2012 Republican presidential nominee , has campaigned for Cotton .Most polls have reflected a disdain among voters for Obama , which observers say is the core of Pryor 's difficulty .`` Obama is still poison here , '' Tilton said .Pryor is a third-generation Arkansas politician whose father , David Pryor , served as a congressman , governor and U.S. senator .After keeping a low profile during previous Senate races , the elder Pryor has taken a visible role this year , making speeches and appearing in a TV commercial with his son .Harvard-educated Cotton has been trying to tie Pryor to a different politician , President Obama .Cotton has attacked Pryor for his support of one of the Obama administration 's center-piece policies , the Affordable Care Act , also known as `` Obamacare . ''Arkansas drew up its own , bipartisan version of Obamacare , with 200,000 previously uninsured citizens enrolling in the state 's plan , which uses federal funds to subsidize health coverage purchased from private carriers .`` Pryor has been a centrist , which has always been the key to political success in Arkansas , '' said Angie Maxwell , a professor of political science at the University of Arkansas .`` It will be interesting to see if the center has shifted that far to the right .

LITTLE ROCK — Arkansas lawmakers will try once again this week to provide funding for the state 's Private Option medical insurance plan that has drawn interest from lawmakers in other states as an alternative to Obamacare .The Arkansas Senate approved the $ 915 million appropriation for the Private Option plan last week , but the House narrowly rejected it in several votes last week . Governor Mike Beebe , a Democrat who helped craft the plan with Republican lawmakers who control the statehouse , said failure to pass the funding could blow a hole in the budget .`` The very Republican anti-Washington healthcare contingent , when all this came out , that did n't want a state exchange now has come to the conclusion that they want to reverse their position and do a state exchange , '' Beebe told a news conference in Washington on Monday .He warned that failure to pass the funding could lead to a loss of $ 89 million in projected savings coming from the Private Option , prompting drastic cuts in services .House Speaker Davy Carter , a Republican and a Private Option supporter , has expressed confidence that funding will eventually be secured . The House will probably vote on the bill on Tuesday , and every day after that until it passes , he said .Beebe has warned that failure to continue the Private Option would make his proposed $ 5 billion state budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1 untenable , because savings the program anticipates would compensate for tax cuts Republicans demanded .Last week , the 100-member House fell just a few votes short of the 75 votes needed to continue funding .The program uses federal Medicaid funds from the Affordable Care Act , or Obamacare , to help buy health insurance for low-income Arkansans , many of whom would otherwise be assigned to Medicaid or have treatment costs absorbed by doctors and other healthcare providers .The plan appeals to some conservative lawmakers who want to provide healthcare for the uninsured through the private sector rather than the federal Medicaid program . It also fits the Obama administration 's goal of seeing states use federal Medicaid money to provide insurance for lower-income residents .Both houses in the Arkansas legislature are controlled by Republicans opposed to Obamacare but divided on whether the Private Option is a reasonable alternative .`` Republican governors and Republican states and anti-Obamacare and anti-federal government healthcare folks are saying , 'Gosh , we need to do what Arkansas is doing ' , '' Beebe said in a Reuters interview last week .The Arkansas experiment has been adopted or considered in some form by states including Republican strongholds such as Utah , and battleground states in presidential elections including Pennsylvania , Michigan and Ohio .GOVERNMENT INTERFERENCEOpponents in the Arkansas General Assembly said both the Private Option and the Affordable Care Act are too costly and represent an unacceptable expansion of government .State Representative Nate Bell , a Republican from Mena , Arkansas , voted against the program in 2013 .He advocates passing the appropriation this year only with amendments such as eliminating money for advertising and marketing that advocates say is important to broaden participation and hold down costs .The Democratic governor and the program 's legislative advocates have accepted that such amendments may be necessary to win the additional Republican votes needed to keep it funded .Senator Larry Teague , a Democrat from Nashville , Arkansas , and the co-chair of the legislature 's Joint Budget Committee , said legislation with `` any connection at all '' to Obama 's signature healthcare law is doomed among some Republicans .( Additional reporting by David Morgan in Washington , DC ; Writing by Jon Herskovitz ; Editing by Jan Paschal and David Gregorio )
LONDON — A sobering statistic emerged on Thursday as the United States Supreme Court prepared to deliver its judgment on Obamacare .It confirmed that the U.S. spends more per capita on publicly funded health care than almost every other country in the developed world . And that includes countries that provide free health care to all their citizens .Figures published on Thursday by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development , a 34-nation grouping of advanced economies , showed that less than half of health spending in the U.S. was publicly financed compared with an O.E.C.D . average of 72.2 percent .“However , the overall level of health spending in the United States is so high that public ( i.e . government ) spending on health per capita is still greater than in all other O.E.C.D . countries , except Norway and the Netherlands , ” according to the Paris-based organization’s Health Data 2012 report .Combined public and private spending on health care in the U.S. came to $ 8,233 per person in 2010 , more than twice as much as relatively rich European countries such as France , Sweden and Britain that provide universal health care .Are Americans healthier as a result ? The U.S. has fewer doctors per capita than comparable countries , and fewer hospital beds . But more is spent on advanced diagnostic equipment and health tests .Life expectancy has risen in line with that in other developed countries , but the average American life span of 78.7 years in 2010 was below the O.E.C.D . average . Obesity in the U.S. was the highest in the 34-nation survey .“Obesity’s growing prevalence foreshadows increases in the occurrence of health problems ( such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases ) , and higher health care costs in the future , ” the O.E.C.D . said .An earlier survey found that U.S. health care was overpriced and not always better than in comparable countries . “Sometimes treatments are provided which are unnecessary , or even undesirable , ” the organization said in a 2011 report on comparative health indicators .“It does a lot of elective surgery , ” the survey said of the U.S. health care system , “the sort of activities where it is not always clear-cut about whether a particular intervention is necessary or not.”Advocates of state-funded universal health care might use such statistics to show free health care for all is not only fairer but also cheaper .In defense of a Canadian health care system maligned during the Obamacare debate as “an inefficient socialistic enterprise , ” Tim Shufelt of Canada’s Financial Post wrote : “Canadians pay much less per capita on health care than do Americans , while ranking higher among the most common measures of human health.”Canada’s embrace of universal health care reflects sentiment in most countries where free treatment is regarded as a right .“In Europe…the right of access to health care for all is considered normal , ” Pierre-Yves Dugua wrote in a Figaro blog , “as is a financing system based on compulsory contributions.”The economic arguments in favor of European-style systems have been evident in the domestic U.S. debate on Obamacare .Commenting on the latest O.E.C.D . figures , an editorial in Gannett’s The Advertiser noted : “America pays big-time money for health care and gets Third World results.”“The greatest public good comes from universal access to care that emphasizes prevention and health education , ” according to article . “The European systems , often socialized or with health insurers forced to offer basic plans to everyone , can do that . Ours doesn’t.”
LOS ANGELES — On Tuesday night , an expected crowd of 100 or so screenwriters and others will gather in Lower Manhattan at the headquarters of the Writers Guild of America East to hear thoughts about the Affordable Care Act and its place in comedy and drama .But whether any movie and television scripts that happen to be affected will have audiences laughing or crying about Obamacare still is not clear .“This is such a contentious issue , no one’s pretending” there will not be robust disagreements on-screen , as in life , said Martin Kaplan , who spoke by telephone last week about the seminar , which drew criticism as a potential propaganda-fest in favor of the law when word of it surfaced last month .Mr. Kaplan , as director of the University of Southern California’s Norman Lear Center , helped organize the gathering under a grant made last fall by the California Endowment . That health-oriented nonprofit organization was financed by the insurance industry in a transaction that years ago turned WellPoint Health Networks into a publicly traded entity separate from the Blue Cross nonprofit group that had created it .Early reports said the Lear Center and the endowment would work to promote enrollment in insurance plans under the new health law .But after months of rancorous debate over the law and its troubled introduction , Mr. Kaplan and Michael Winship , president of the Writers Guild of America East , who spoke in a joint interview , were taking a more subdued approach .“This is not about advising writers ; we’re in search of information , ” Mr. Winship said . He and Mr. Kaplan emphasized that conflicting views on Obamacare should be welcome in entertainment , as long as they are based in fact .“Those writers can have any point of view they want , ” Mr. Kaplan said .“If they think things went downhill when the ‘public option’ came off the table , that’s O.K . too.”Still , Tuesday’s panel is not exactly packed with opponents of the law . It will be moderated by Mr. Kaplan and Mr. Winship , and includes Wendell Potter , a former insurance executive who has publicly defended Obamacare , and Julie Green Bataille , from the federal government’s Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services .

LOUISVILLE , Ky. — Two groups with close ties to Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell are on track to spend nearly $ 20 million on television advertisements to sway Kentucky voters , a staggering amount for a single race that stands as a textbook example of the use of outside money in a tight contest .While the effort began more than a year ago , the majority of the advertising by the Kentucky Opportunity Coalition and Kentuckians for Strong Leadership has aired since McConnell and Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes won primaries in mid-May .Much of it is relentlessly negative toward the Democratic challenger and President Barack Obama , who is highly unpopular in the state . `` Liberals coast to coast are rolling out the red carpet for Alison Grimes . She 's backed by Obama 's biggest fundraisers , '' said one early ad .`` Obamacare , the war on coal , big spending , higher taxes . That 's Obama 's agenda . And Alison Grimes supports Obama , '' said another .Charly Norton , a spokeswoman for Grimes , said that the senator 's `` millionaire and billionaire cronies have targeted this race more than any other in the country . '' She added McConnell has called in the `` DC special interest cavalry to help bail him out , but it 's not working as our campaign remains ... positioned to win on November 4th . ''Federal law prohibits any coordination between the McConnell campaign and the two groups , one a SuperPAC and the other a nonprofit , often referred to as a `` c4 '' for the section of law that governs its operations . At the same time , the groups ' efforts intensified this spring , when the senator took something of an advertising breather after he won his primary over tea party challenger Matt Bevin .One or the other outside organization was on the air almost nonstop from May until Labor Day , an advertising campaign that coincided with a run of polls that indicate erosion in Grimes ' support at a time McConnell is plagued with chronically weak favorability ratings of his own .Democrats strongly dispute the public surveys , and say the race remains exceedingly tight . The party 's senatorial campaign committee is on the verge of an intensive round of television advertising to boost Grimes as the race enters its final five weeks .The groups backing McConnell also invested in radio and Internet ads and T-shirts in their drive to return the Kentucky Republican to the Senate for a sixth term , often emphasizing the same issues that the senator mentions in his own advertising .`` We have owned rural radio ... and coal country since the ( campaign 's ) beginning , '' said Scott Jennings , a spokesman for the two groups . He referred to advertising alleging that Grimes would back policies detrimental to an industry reeling from the loss of thousands of jobs .SuperPACs first came to prominence in the 2012 presidential campaign , and Center for Responsive Politics lists more than 70 in existence this year to help individual candidates . It 's not known how many campaigns are backed by the same combination that supports McConnell .Fred Wertheimer , president of Democracy 21 — a nonprofit , nonpartisan group that analyzes the influence of money in politics — said the roles played by both SuperPACs and political nonprofits permit donors to circumvent the $ 5,200-per-person cap that federal law sets for contributions to individual candidates .`` When you have a SuperPAC and a c4 focused on one candidate , the only purpose of the c4 is to allow donors to give secret money to the candidate , '' he said . `` The money is n't secret from the donors or the candidates , it 's only secret from the American people . ''Kentuckians for Strong Leadership , a SuperPAC , may take unlimited donations and must disclose its donors . It may advocate directly for a candidate 's victory or defeat . Kentucky Opportunity Coalition does not have to disclose its donors , and is limited in its advocacy .Other groups take a similar two-track approach in the increasingly important world of independent political spending . Associates of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid aid Democratic candidates through Senate Majority PAC and Patriot Majority .Republican strategist Karl Rove backs a pair of groups , American Crossroads and Crossroads GPS , operating under the same general guidelines .Unlike the organizations supporting McConnell , the groups aligned with Reid and Rove are national , airing advertising in numerous states with key Senate races .The Kentucky groups have a single-state focus , although they rely heavily on Crossroads ' political consultants and have received donations from some of Crossroads ' contributors . Stephen Law , president of both Crossroads organizations , is on the three-member board of KSL . Law is also former chief of staff for McConnell and served under former Labor Secretary Elaine Chao , the senator 's wife .On its website , KOC says it `` seeks to be a positive voice for those who seek to make our commonwealth a better place . ''To that end , it ran a television commercial in August that said Grimes ' attacks on McConnell had been `` exposed as blatantly dishonest , phony , a throwback to Obama 's lies . '' It added that Grimes is `` bankrolled by Obama elites who oppose our way of life , '' and concluded , `` Alison Grimes : Beholden to Obama . Lying to us . ''
LOUISVILLE Ky. ( Reuters ) - U.S. Senate Republican chief Mitch McConnell of Kentucky won re-election to a sixth term , Reuters/Ipsos projected on Tuesday , moving a step closer to fulfilling his ambition of becoming majority leader of the chamber .McConnell , 72 , who was first elected in 1984 , has pledged to battle President Barack Obama on issues ranging from healthcare to border security during the Democratic leader 's final two years in office .`` Friends , this experiment in big government has lasted long enough . It’s time to go in a new direction , '' he told supporters at a post-election party in Louisville .`` But we do have an obligation to work together on issues where we can agree . I think we have a duty to do that , '' he added .McConnell defeated Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes , a 35-year-old Democrat who refused to say during the campaign whether she had voted for Obama .With McConnell and fellow Republicans seizing control of the Senate from Democrats , the veteran politician has the inside track to become the majority leader , a powerful position from which he could derail what remains of Obama 's second-term legislative agenda .Kentucky 's junior U.S . Senator Rand Paul hailed McConnell 's re-election as a `` great victory for the country and for Kentucky . ''`` Tonight we begin to rebuild America , '' he said . `` Under Mitch McConnell , we will send the president bill after bill until he wearies from it . ''McConnell has said he would work to repeal the Affordable Care Act , a signature piece of legislation for Obama .After battling low approval ratings at home , McConnell hammered away at Grimes by relying on broad financial support from corporations and donors to launch a series of withering attack ads .The longest-serving senator in Kentucky 's history also used social media to soften his image and make light of his blandness .When Grimes aired an ad recently saying `` I 'm not Barack Obama , '' McConnell hit back with an ad linking her to Obama 's agenda on gun control , foreign policy , Obamacare and coal regulations , even though she opposes the president on the last issue .The list of corporate donors to McConnell includes Citigroup and Raytheon . Kentuckians for Strong Leadership , a group set up by McConnell allies , touts large contributions from real estate tycoon Donald Trump , venture capitalist Lawrence DeGeorge of Florida and oil executive Curtis Mewbourne of Texas .In their only debate , Grimes said McConnell represented Washington more than Kentucky after 30 years in office . Democrats pulled ad buys from the state in a blow to Grimes , but brought them back in the closing weeks with polls showing the race still tight .Louisville voter Norman Anderson , a 40-year-old railroad worker , said he voted for McConnell , hoping that Republican control of both houses of Congress would boost an economy that he said `` stinks . ''`` I look for more positive legislation instead of one side pointing the finger at the other , '' he said .McConnell , born in Alabama , attended high school in Kentucky and graduated from the University of Louisville and the University of Kentucky’s law school .In five previous Senate bids , he has won more than 55 percent of the vote only once . In his last race , in 2008 , he won with 53 percent .( Reporting by Diane Bartz in Washington and David Bailey in Minneapolis ; Writing by Jon Herskovitz ; Editing by Peter Cooney , Eric Walsh and Jim Loney )

Laboratory Corp of America’s $ 6.1 billion deal for Covance tests positive for value destruction .The strategic logic behind adding the clinical trial outsourcing company to the firm that checks patients’ blood and other fluids is hazy . Shareholders’ financial diagnosis is damning , too . They took some $ 700 million off the value of LabCorp as cost cuts fell far short of the 32 percent premium paid .There’s little revenue overlap between the two — LabCorp estimated the figure at less than 3 percent of its businesses . That means antitrust won’t be a concern , but it also limits the scope for reducing expenses . The companies figure there are $ 100 million of estimated savings . These are worth perhaps $ 700 million to shareholders today , once taxed , capitalized and discounted for the three years it’ll take to realize them . That covers just half the $ 1.4 billion sweetener LabCorp is paying for control .Executives are hoping that greater revenue will make up the shortfall . Considering where health care appears to be going , that general premise holds some water . Doctors are increasingly being paid based on how patients fare , rather than the number of people treated . LabCorp already has a taste of this model under the Affordable Care Act . Obamacare has increased the number of patients with insurance , but is squeezing prices paid per test .The idea is that owning Covance will allow LabCorp to inject more into its top line by combining and then acting on the data generated by labs and clinical trials . One example would be to offer patients who test positive for a rare disease the chance to participate in a trial for a potential treatment . Another would use practical lab work and theoretical results from clinical trials to determine which LabCorp patients are most likely to have a heart attack .It’s an appealing vision , but combining two completely different businesses is hard . Doing so while simultaneously shifting focus to new services , some of which don’t exist yet , is even tougher . New start-ups , meanwhile , like ultra-rapid and cheap testing firm Theranos , are threatening to upend the testing business . Until LabCorp can show there’s merit to its vision of health care , investors are right to regard the deal as an overpriced foible .Robert Cyran is a columnist for Reuters Breakingviews .

Last summer , lawmakers churned out news releases using the term Obamacare , 530 of them in June , July and August .This summer ? 138 .A year ago , the individual mandate for what is officially known as the Affordable Care Act had yet to go into effect . Federal and state exchange websites had yet to go live , and congressional appropriators were still writing government spending legislation with an eye toward defunding the law ( leading to the partial government shutdown later that year ) .In a typical expression of sentiment from last summer , John Culberson , a Texas Republican , published an email to constituents entitled “My Day Is Not Complete Unless I Vote to Cut Spending and Repeal Obamacare.”This summer , not only are there fewer Obamacare-related news releases , but the tone is also different . Constituents are more likely to read statements on judicial decisions on the law , news about bills intended to trim around the law’s edges , or descriptions of lawmakers’ requests for information from the Department of Health and Human Services .Although the occasional statements praising the law have been issued by some congressional Democrats , most in that party still appear to shy away from the topic . The database of congressional news releases maintained by The Upshot contains just two positive statements mentioning Obamacare in the title last summer , from José E. Serrano of New York and Carol Shea-Porter of New Hampshire , both Democrats .Congressional opponents of Obamacare haven’t given up , of course . But the relative dearth of Obamacare-titled statements this August shows that they have found other issues to raise with constituents as the midterm elections approach , like investigations into the Internal Revenue Service and Department of Veterans Affairs .Congressional news releases mentioning “veterans” in the title have jumped more than 105 percent this summer compared with 2013 .
Last week , House Republicans released a deliberately misleading report on the status of health reform , crudely rigging the numbers to sustain the illusion of failure in the face of unexpected success . Are you shocked ?You aren’t , but you should be . Mainstream politicians didn’t always try to advance their agenda through lies , damned lies and — in this case — bogus statistics . And the fact that this has become standard operating procedure for a major party bodes ill for America’s future .About that report : The really big policy news of 2014 , at least so far , is the spectacular recovery of the Affordable Care Act from its stumbling start , thanks to an extraordinary late surge that took enrollment beyond early projections . The age mix of enrollees has improved ; insurance companies are broadly satisfied with the risk pool . Multiple independent surveys confirm that the percentage of Americans without health insurance has already declined substantially , and there’s every reason to believe that over the next two years the act will meet its overall goals , except in states that refuse to expand Medicaid .This is a problem for Republicans , who have bet the ranch on the proposition that health reform is an unfixable failure . “Nobody can make Obamacare work , ” declared Eric Cantor , the House majority leader , a couple of weeks ago ( when it was already obvious that it was working pretty well ) . How can they respond to good news ?Well , they could graciously admit that they were wrong , and offer constructive suggestions about how to make the law work even better . Oh , sorry — I forgot that I wasn’t writing jokes for the White House Correspondents’ Dinner .No , they have in fact continued to do what they’ve been doing ever since the news on Obamacare started turning positive : sling as much mud as possible at health reform , in the hope that some of it sticks . Premiums were soaring , they declared , when they have actually come in below projections . Millions of people were losing coverage , they insisted , when the great bulk of those whose policies were canceled simply replaced them with new policies . The Obama administration was cooking the books , they cried ( projection , anyone ? ) . And , of course , they keep peddling horror stories about people suffering terribly from Obamacare , not one of which has actually withstood scrutiny .Now comes the latest claim — that many of the people who signed up for insurance aren’t actually paying their premiums . Obviously this claim is part of a continuing pattern . It also , however , involves a change in tactics . Previous attacks on Obamacare were pretty much fact-free ; this time the claim was backed by an actual survey purporting to show that a third of enrollees hadn’t paid their first premium .But the survey was rigged . ( Are you surprised ? ) It asked insurers how many enrollees had paid their first premium ; it ignored the fact that the first premium wasn’t even due for the millions of people who signed up for insurance after March 15 .And the fact that the survey was so transparently rigged is a smoking gun , proving that the attacks on Obamacare aren’t just bogus ; they’re deliberately bogus . The staffers who set up that survey knew enough about the numbers to skew them , which meant that they have to have known that Obamacare is actually doing O.K .So why are Republicans doing this ? Sad to say , there’s method in their fraudulence .First of all , it fires up the base . After this latest exercise in deception , we can be fairly sure that Republican leaders know perfectly well that Obamacare has failed to fail . But the party faithful don’t . Like anyone who writes about these issues , I get vast amounts of mail from people who know , just know , that insurance premiums are skyrocketing , that far more people have lost insurance because of Obummercare than have gained it , that all the horror stories are real , and that anyone who says otherwise is just a liberal shill .Beyond that , the constant harping on alleged failure works as innuendo even if each individual claim collapses in the face of evidence . A recent poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that a majority of Americans know that more than eight million people enrolled in health exchanges ; but it also found a majority of respondents believing that this was below expectations , and that the law was working badly .So Republicans are spreading disinformation about health reform because it works , and because they can — there is no sign that they pay any political price when their accusations are proved false .And that observation should scare you . What happens to the Congressional Budget Office if a party that has learned that lying about numbers works takes full control of Congress ? What happens if it regains the White House , too ? Nothing good , that’s for sure .

Like anyone who writes about these issues , I get vast amounts of mail from people who know , just know , that insurance premiums are skyrocketing , that far more people have lost insurance because of Obummercare than have gained it , that all the horror stories are real , and that anyone who says otherwise is just a liberal shill .Beyond that , the constant harping on alleged failure works as innuendo even if each individual claim collapses in the face of evidence . A recent poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that a majority of Americans know that more than eight million people enrolled in health exchanges ; but it also found a majority of respondents believing that this was below expectations , and that the law was working badly .So Republicans are spreading disinformation about health reform because it works , and because they can — there is no sign that they pay any political price when their accusations are proved false .And that observation should scare you . What happens to the Congressional Budget Office if a party that has learned that lying about numbers works takes full control of Congress ? What happens if it regains the White House , too ? Nothing good , that’s for sure .
Last week , I took issue with the claim , advanced by Jonathan Chait and Josh Barro , that the idea of a legitimate conservative alternative to Obamacare is a fantasy rather than a difficult-to-achieve but nonetheless plausible goal . Here are a few pieces laying out some material relevant to this conversation : One from Ramesh Ponnuru in 2010 , discussing the various things Republicans did do on health care ( for good and ill ) during the decade they controlled Congress ; one from Avik Roy , analyzing the insurance-expanding health care reform that George W. Bush proposed ( to swift and certain opposition from Democrats ) in 2007 ; and one from Yuval Levin , in which he discusses the McCain campaign’s 2008 proposal and Paul Ryan’s 2009 alternative to the Democratic health care bill . Taken together , they suggest that the Republican Party is at least institutionally capable of advancing reforms that improve access to health insurance : Such reforms may not have been advanced on Capitol Hill of late , but they aren’t the policy equivalent of unicorns .Now it’s true that most of these Republican reforms , real and hypothetical , would not have insured many people ( at least initially ) as Obamacare . It’s also true that in the last few years , the G.O.P . has been moving away from even a rhetorical commitment to the goal of perfectly universal coverage . But on both counts I think that the conservative approach is defensible . Given the unsustainability of our existing commitments , the central role that spiraling costs play in making insurance inaccessible , and the difficulties inherent in trying to make Washington responsible for insuring every inhabitant of what will be a nation of 400 million people by century’s end , a reform that expanded insurance substantially but not completely in the short term while putting the health care system as a whole on a sounder footing in the long run ( as Bush’s 2007 proposal might have done ) could be preferable , on moral as well as practical grounds , to a reform that achieves universality in the near term but ultimately brings everybody on board a sinking ship . ( Although “universal but non-comprehensive” is also a plausible way of thinking about what the conservative goal for health care coverage ought to be . )The big problem facing conservative health care reformers , then , is not the G.O.P.’s unwillingness to embrace universality , and despite what many liberals believe neither is it necessarily libertarian dogma or Norquistian intransigence . It’s a more basic problem of coalition politics : Any substantial health care reform , market-oriented as well as dirigiste , is inevitably disruptive , and ( as Reihan Salam points out ) the Republican coalition includes more voters who are satisfied with existing arrangements than does the Democratic coalition . As we saw in 2009-2010 , to pass a comprehensive health care bill you need not only policy commitments from elected officials but immense internal pressure from the party’s activist groups and rank-and-file . The Republican coalition just isn’t as likely to generate that kind of pressure on its elected officials , and indeed certain segments of that coalition are likely to find reason to resist even the most impeccably free-market reform . Straightforward risk aversion , not ideology , is the crucial factor discouraging Republican politicians from taking the lead on the issue .But this is precisely why the current political moment presents a unique opportunity to conservatives . The fact that the Democrats did pull out all the stops in 2009-2010 , courting a giant backlash in the process , means there’s a unusually large amount of political cover for a right-of-center alternative . ( Repeal-and-replace is an easier lift than a stand-alone overhaul would be , because the Republican constituencies who might stand to lose from a more market-friendly reform fear Obamacare much , much more . ) At the same time , through their support for the Ryan budget , the Congressional G.O.P . has pre-committed to entitlement reform votes that make a vote for a right-of-center health care alternative look relatively noncontroversial by comparison . Whether Obamacare is repealed or left intact , it’s hard to imagine a better atmosphere for figuring out , and then forging ahead with , what Republicans actually want to do instead .But of course to date the G.O.P . has done precious little with this opportunity , preferring to play the political angles instead . And here my views do overlap with Chait and Barro : If the Republicans win the White House and the Senate and then somehow manage to repeal Obamacare without putting any significant reforms in its place , it will represent not only policy malpractice , but a moral scandal as well .
Last week , National Review’s editors quoted my praise for Utah’s soon-to-be ex-senator , Bob Bennett , in the course of arguing that conservatives shouldn’t feel any regret over his Tea Party-abetted defeat . Since the case against Bennett emphasized his support for the bipartisan Wyden-Bennett health care bill , NR’s editorial focuses on that legislation’s drawbacks:Bennett’s bill was not superior to Obamacare . It was worse than it in some respects , but in the crucial respects it was simply identical . Obamacare’s three main elements are regulations that block insurance companies from accurately pricing risk , a requirement that all people buy this irrationally priced product , and subsidies to help some of them do that . Bennett’s legislation featured all three elements . His legislation would have resulted in lower health spending than Obamacare , and more people would have purchased insurance for themselves rather than through their employers . But the lower spending would largely have been generated by pushing people into HMOs rather than by freeing them to make their own cost-quality trade-offs . And the solution to a decades-long federal policy of encouraging employer provision of health insurance is not a sudden move to a federal policy of prohibiting it .Wyden-Bennett was not my preferred health care reform either , but was it really no better than Obamacare from a conservative perspective ? It scored as deficit neutral with many fewer spending cuts and tax increases than the legislation we actually got . It did away with Medicaid and S-CHIP entirely . And it severed the link between employment and insurance with one swift stroke . Yes , its mix of mandates and regulations mirrored some of the major features of Obamacare , but one could level a similar critique about the provisions of the alternative health care legislation that Paul Ryan and Tom Coburn co-sponsored , and I trust that NR would not welcome a primary challenge against either of those legislators .The editorial goes on to argue that Wyden-Bennett would have been “at least as unpopular as Obamacare proved” if it had ever emerged as a viable alternative , and so “the notion that it could have been a vehicle for heading off Obamacare is a fantasy.” This may be true , but remember that many of the more conservative alternatives to Obamacare would have presumably been more unpopular still . ( The Wyden-Bennett bill was almost certainly a more politically-plausible reform than John McCain’s 2008 health care plan , for instance , which was basically Wyden-Bennett with fewer mandates and regulations and a less progressive system of tax subsidies . ) And given that the Democrats ended up winning the health care battle outright , I’m not sure I’d be as quick as NR’s editors to dismiss one of the substantial efforts to forge a less-bad compromise .A successful political party can live without lawmakers who are obsessed with compromise for compromise’s sake , trimmers who constantly shift leftward and rightward depending on the political winds , and politicians who by rights belong in the opposition party . ( Hence my lack of sympathy for Charlie Crist , Arlen Specter , and Dede Scozzafava . ) But it needs to accommodate intelligent deviations and disagreements , and well-intentioned efforts at bipartisanship from politicians who line up with their party 80 or 90 percent of the time . National Review’s editors recognized this principle two years ago when they endorsed Mitt Romney for President of the United States , his support for an Obama-style health care bill in Massachusetts notwithstanding . ( “He knows that not every feature of the health-care plan he enacted in Massachusetts should be replicated nationally , ” they wrote at the time , “but he can also speak with more authority than any of the other Republican candidates about this pressing issue.” ) Given that Wyden-Bennett was superior to Romneycare in several important ways , I wish that they had extended the same charity to Bob Bennett .
Leading up to the crisis in Washington , the right-wing of the right-wing party stressed that blocking the continuing resolution was essential because it represented the last , best chance to stop the Affordable Care Act . “Last , best chance” was actually a mantra of sorts . “This is our last chance and our last best chance to do something about this , ” said Senator Marco Rubio , Republican of Florida , on the Senate floor in late July . “ [ T ] his may be the last best chance to defund Obamacare before it goes into effect , ” the political group FreedomWorks argued over the summer .Now that the shutdown has come and gone , some Republicans recognize that the defund-or-shutdown tactic was doomed to fail . “I think we have fully now acquainted our new members with what a losing strategy that is , ” Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said on Thursday .But many are vowing to keep fighting health care reform . On Wednesday , Mr. Rubio predicted that there would “be an all-out revolt in this country” over the Affordable Care Act . And when that happens “that is , I think , the moment to absolutely act and say we are going to get rid of this law and then look for opportunities in the future to replace it.”The next day , Senator Ted Cruz said “I would do anything , and I will continue to do anything , to stop the train wreck that is Obamacare.”Matt Kibbe , the president of FreedomWorks , told The Washington Post that he plans to hold rallies with young people who oppose the individual mandate .And in a Thursday op-ed for The Wall Street Journal , Jim DeMint , president of the Heritage Foundation , claimed there was no good reason for him to back down . Sure , the president won re-election , but “ObamaCare was not the central fight in 2012.” Sure , full repeal is probably impossible while a Democrat’s in office , “but delaying implementation by withholding funds” is “a reasonable and necessary fight.” By keeping the national focus on health care , moreover , Republicans can avoid negotiating other issues . “If the Republicans had not fought on Obamacare , the compromise would have been over the budget sequester.”Last and best , it turns out , can mean one of many .
Let’s imagine that Republicans swept the 2012 elections and were now in control not merely of the House but of the presidency and the Senate , too .Now let’s take it one step further and say that by using the filibuster the Democratic minority in the Senate had successfully blocked President Romney’s appointments to federal district and appellate court judgeships .What if , faced with this Democratic intransigence , the conservative Federalist Society helped devise a strategy to revamp Senate rules to eliminate the filibuster so that judicial nominees could be confirmed by a simple majority instead of the 60 votes required to overcome a filibuster ?The elimination of the filibuster has allowed President Romney to appoint three judges to the critically important United States Court of Appeals , District of Columbia Circuit , establishing a decisive 7 to 4 conservative majority on that bench . What’s more , two of the the three judges newly appointed by President Romney are members of the Federalist Society and the new conservative majority on the D.C . Circuit is now positioned to rule Obamacare unconstitutional .The Koch brothers — recall we are still in an alt-hypothetical universe — reward the Federalist Society by directing 100 loyal billionaires to contribute to the group .Would these developments provoke liberal outrage ?They certainly would .But it’s not only the right that uses secretive organizations to keep rich donors anonymous while it seeks to influence elections and policy . Liberals do the same , and the press in large part gives them a pass .As you no doubt realized while you were reading , the hypothetical described above did not take place , but something approximating it did . Instead of Republican offenders , the players were President Obama , a Democratic Senate , the progressive American Constitution Society , and the Democracy Alliance , a network of very wealthy liberal donors .Here’s what the Democratic Party and its allies actually did . The American Constitution Society — the left counterpart to the Federalist Society — helped lay the intellectual groundwork for Senate Democrats to put an end to filibusters of judicial nominees .The elimination of judicial filibusters in November 2013 allowed Democrats to approve , by simple majority , three of Obama’s appointees to the United States Court of Appeals , D.C . Circuit , giving liberals a 7-4 majority .Because of the administrative law and national security cases it hears , the D.C . Circuit is considered the second most important court in the nation .The significance of the confirmation of three new Democratic appointees to the court became apparent in July , when a three-judge panel of the court ruled 2-1 in Halbig v. Burwell that residents of the 36 states that use the federal health care exchange were ineligible for subsidized insurance under Obamacare . The panel’s decision appeared to be a potentially crippling blow to the Affordable Care Act . The two judges in the majority on the panel were appointed by Republican presidents , the dissenter by a Democrat .On Sept. 4 , however , the full Circuit Court of Appeals decided to set aside the three-judge panel decision and rehear the case en banc – that is , with all 11 judges , a majority of whom are now Democratic appointees .Has there been an outcry about Democratic court packing ? Only in a right-wing online publication , the Washington Free Beacon , “Democracy Alliance Bankrolled Court-Packing Scheme , ” and on the conservative website Breitbart.com , “Exclusive - Leftist Money , Harry Reid Trying to Hijack ‘Sanctity of the Independent Federal Judiciary.’ ”But the story does not end there . Conservatives claim that the Democracy Alliance is at the core of a liberal conspiracy .Mark Holden , general counsel at Koch Industries , contends that the Democracy Alliance orchestrates the activities of a permanent “left infrastructure” with ties to 172 organizations , each determined to attack the Koch brothers’ agenda of free enterprise and democratic capitalism .In a speech he gave to a closed meeting of conservative donors in Dana Point , Calif. , on June 16 , “The Opposition : Understanding Their Strategy and Infrastructure , ” Holden , speaking about liberal organizations , argued thatThe Koch organization network is well known for its secretiveness . Holden suggested that “their [ Democracy Alliance ] bottom line is not that different than ours , but in some ways they’re much better at it.”A tape and transcript of Holden’s speech were released by the left-leaning website Lady Libertine which , by its own account , seeks “to unite the disenfranchised and resurrect the American Dream.” Holden confirmed its veracity in an email to The Huffington Post .Despite Holden’s argument that the liberal and conservative “dark money” networks are equivalent , there are substantial differences between them .The Democracy Alliance is an organization of roughly 100 very rich men and women who agree to contribute at least $ 200,000 annually to a list of roughly 20 liberal think tanks and advocacy groups , according to documents obtained by Politico . The Alliance itself makes no contributions . Nor does it pay for television ads or engage in other direct campaign activity .In effect , the Alliance helps guide an estimated $ 30 million a year . It does not disclose its members or the groups that are recipients of its members’ contributions , although a substantial amount of information has been gleaned by enterprising reporters .The projected total budgets of the endorsed organizations for 2014 , according to the documents , are $ 189.2 million , of which the $ 30 million from Democracy Alliance partners would amount to nearly 15 percent .The Alliance does not claim tax-exempt status .In contrast , the Koch network is overwhelmingly made up of tax-exempt organizations claiming either 501 ( c ) 4 or 501 ( c ) 6 exempt status . Many of the Koch organizations spend money on political ads . The Center for Responsive Politics and the Washington Post estimated that in the 2011-12 election cycle , the Koch network of political , tax-exempt nonprofits raised at least $ 400 million .Gara LaMarche , the president of Democracy Alliance , defended his members , who have been accused of hypocrisy . The charge , coming from both the left and right , LaMarche wrote , centers “on the assertion that progressive wealthy donors are spending a lot of money in elections when they also claim to be for getting money out of elections.”LaMarche countered in an email thatIn contrast , political spending by the Kochs and their alliesDavid Brock , the chairman of Media Matters , which is one of the groups endorsed by the Alliance , made a similar argument at a Democracy Alliance meeting in Santa Fe in June:Brock and LaMarche’s argument is politically risky . Claiming the moral high ground to assert that you can do something that your morally crippled adversaries can not is one of the more effective strategies to alienate people .Liberals are not alone in the gravity of their claims . Officials of Koch Industries contend there have been “death threats against the Kochs and threats against our facilities.” They like to cite a 1958 Supreme Court decision , N.A.A.C.P . v. Alabama , in which the court unanimously backed the N.A.A.C.P.’s refusal to turn over its membership list to the Alabama Attorney General on the basis that release of the names would put the lives of N.A.A.C.P . members in danger .The leadership of the Democracy Alliance is now queasy about its policies on anonymous donations . The Koch organizations remain adamant in their refusal to disclose donors .In a series of emails and phone conversations , LaMarche said that he is pressing members of the Alliance to be more open . He would like , for example , to list the names of those willing to give up their privacy . He also said that he expects the Alliance to adopt a policy of releasing the names of the organizations to which it recommends its members make contributions .“The more transparent we can be , the better . Progressive values are much more in line with transparency , ” LaMarche said during our conversation .Koch officials declined to answer my question , “Is transparency a good thing in democratic politics ? ”Political spending by dark money groups that do not disclose donors is on track to break all previous records . By some calculations , such spending accounts for more than half the media outlay by outside organizations in current House and Senate races .Robert Maguire , who set up the Politically Active Nonprofits Project at the Center for Responsive Politics , reported on Sept. 4 that “dark money organizations have already dropped $ 68 million on air time alone in Senate and House races , making up 56 percent of all the spending” by independent expenditure groups .Publications like Mother Jones are warning that the 2014 elections will be the start of a “Dark-Money Apocalypse.” If recent Supreme Court rulings stand and the Federal Election Commission continue to refuse to regulate political groups that do not disclose contributors , dark money spending will at some point in the not-too-distant future become the single most important source of election cash in the key battleground contests that determine which party controls the House and Senate . This is already the case for some Republican candidates in tight contests .In the North Carolina Senate race , for example , Thom Tillis , the Republican challenger , has so far spent $ 3.23 million . Conservative dark money groups have invested twice that , $ 6.7 million , in his candidacy . Kay Hagen , the incumbent Democrat , has raised $ 7.96 million , and liberal dark money groups have spent $ 2.1 million .The Center for Responsive Politics has demonstrated that in the top eight 2014 Senate races , dark money tilts decisively to the right : $ 28 million spent by conservative groups , $ 12.3 million by liberal organizations .In the long run , the relatively modest ( but growing ) dependence of Democrats on dark money , mega-dollar contributors to “super PACs” and other funding mechanisms is corrupting , even as it comes alongside the party’s parallel success in building a powerful small donor base . On issues of taxes , regulation , spending and campaign finance , the Republican Party has established itself as the advocate of the wealthiest Americans . Insofar as the Democratic Party moves in the same direction , it will be unable to act as a counterbalance to the right .While neither the left nor the right has clean hands , liberals have far more to lose , and much less to gain , from continued hypocrisy .
Like other big employers , in the mid-1990s Harvard University was struggling with the ballooning cost of providing health insurance .It chose what was a novel solution for the time . It dropped its standard deal â a subsidy that rose in line with the price of the insurance policy â and switched some 10,000 workers on its payroll to a fixed subsidy that encouraged them to shop around for care .For Harvardâs accountants , the change worked wonders . A study a couple of years later by David M. Cutler , a Harvard economist , and Sarah Reber , a Harvard graduate , concluded that competition among insurers cut the universityâs health bill by 5 to 8 percent .But not everybody was equally pleased . Families of workers who chose the Preferred Provider Organization offered by Blue Cross/Blue Shield â the most comprehensive plan , with lots of doctors and hospitals on its network â faced a $ 500-a-year jump in their out-of-pocket spending on health care .Younger and healthier workers canceled their P.P.O . plans , enrolling in cheaper H.M.O . options or dropping Harvard insurance altogether . Left with a sicker patient base , the P.P.O . raised its premiums further , which prompted the next layer of relatively healthy customers to leave .And so on . In 1997 , Blue Cross/Blue Shield withdrew its P.P.O . from the market , making it a victim of what economists call the death spiral of adverse selection .In a couple of months the nation is set to experience a similar shock on a very large scale : the greatest change in how Americans pay for health care since the advent of Medicare nearly half a century ago .Come October , millions of uninsured people will be able to choose one of several health plans , offered at four different tiers of service and cost through new health exchanges coming onstream in every state .Cheap âbronzeâ plans will shoulder some 60 percent of patientsâ medical expenses . Pricey âplatinumâ plans will cover at least 90 percent . But insurers will not be allowed to exclude people with pre-existing conditions , or charge more for the sick , or put a lifetime cap on medical costs . Their policies will have to cover a minimum standard of medical care . And the government will subsidize those who can not afford to buy the policies .President Obama and his advisers hope the overhaul will do two things . The first is to extend coverage to tens of millions of Americans who today lack health insurance . The second is to hold the line on rising health care costs .âOver time , success will depend on what happens to the cost curve , â Professor Cutler told me . âIf we donât bend the cost curve , everything will fail . The government wonât be able to afford it . Nobody will be able to afford it.âIn theory , the overhaul could meet both goals . Millions of new Americans armed with a subsidy and shopping among plans would bring consumer choice to bear , finally , on the health care industry . Insurers would compete to create policies that offered the most value for money , pressuring hospitals and doctors on behalf of all of us .Yet despite the care the administration took in establishing incentives and safeguards , even some of Obamacareâs most committed backers are wondering whether the experiment will work as advertised â or , like Harvardâs P.P.O. , go off the rails along the way .Adverse selection is perhaps the direst threat . For Obamacare to work , millions of healthy , young , uninsured Americans must join a health plan to counterbalance the sicker millions who are most likely to buy insurance . Otherwise , health plans on the exchanges will have to raise premiums to shoulder the higher costs .Selection will also take other forms . Healthier Americans will probably flock to cheaper bronze plans . And insurers will vie to enroll the healthy . In some states , big insurers have chosen not to participate in exchanges to avoid their strictures . On the outside , they could still sell cheap plans to skim off the healthy and avoid a rule that insurers on the exchanges must also offer more generous silver and gold plans .Adverse selection is not the only risk .A few studies have found that more competition among health insurers leads to lower hospital fees on average and that premiums rise when insurer competition diminishes . But researchers have also found that top hospitals â which any decent plan must have on its network â increase their fees when more health plans compete for their business .
Lots of people have been referencing this Democracy Corps report on focus-group meetings with Republicans , and with good reason : Greenberg has basically provided a unified theory of the craziness that has enveloped American politics in the last few years .What the report makes clear is that the current Republican obsession with attacking programs that benefit Americans in need , ranging from food stamps to Obamacare , isn’t about some philosophical commitment to small government , still less worries about incentive effects and implicit marginal tax rates . It’s about anxiety over a changing America — the multiracial , multicultural society we’re becoming — and anger that Democrats are taking Their Money and giving it to Those People . In other words , it’s still race after all these years .One irony here is that at this point it’s the liberals who believe in America , while the conservatives don’t . I believe in our ability to change while retaining our essential nature ; I believe that today’s immigrants will be incorporated into the fabric of our society , just as Italian and Jewish immigrants — once regarded as fundamentally incompatible with American ways — became “white” by the middle of the 20th century .Another irony is that the great right-wing fear — that social insurance programs will in effect buy minority votes for Democrats , leading to further change — is becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy . The GOP could have tried to reach out to immigrants , moderate its stances on Obamacare , and stake out a position as the restrained , sensible party . Instead , it’s alienating all the people it needs to win over , and quite possibly setting the stage for the very liberal dominance it fears .Meanwhile , a key takeaway for us wonks is that none of the ostensible debates we’re having — say , the debate over rising disability rolls — can be taken at face value . Yes , we need to crunch the numbers , but in the end the other side doesn’t care about the evidence .
Lots of people having fun with this great report from Jason Cherkis at the Kentucky State Fair:A middle-aged man in a red golf shirt shuffles up to a small folding table with gold trim , in a booth adorned with a flotilla of helium balloons , where government workers at the Kentucky State Fair are hawking the virtues of Kynect , the state’s health benefit exchange established by Obamacare .The man is impressed . “This beats Obamacare I hope , ” he mutters to one of the workers .This goes along with all the polling evidence , which says that people like the actual provisions of the Affordable Care Act , but have no idea that those provisions are in fact the substance of that terrible , tyrannical “Obamacare” program they keep hearing about . And because the insurance exchanges that are at the heart of the program will be run at the state level , with many different names , we’ll have quite a few people happily signing up for Obamacare while denouncing the program and believing it has nothing to offer them .And I say that it’s all good .It’s true that Democrats running in 2014 will have the extra problem that even people who are getting big benefits from the new program may not understand who to thank . On the other hand , the first and most crucial thing is to get the program up and running , with as many eligible people as possible — especially the relatively young and healthy — signing up . And Republican efforts to dissuade people from joining Obamacare will be blunted to the extent that Americans have no idea that Kynect , or Your Health Idaho , or whatever is in fact the local incarnation of the dread program .Given all the disinformation out there , the strategy of think globally , name locally is actually a great idea . Eventually people will probably figure out that it is in fact a federal program — although maybe not , since a fair number of people apparently don’t know that about Medicare . But by the time they do , they’ll have experienced the thing’s reality , and realized that guaranteed , subsidized insurance is not , in fact , slavery .
MANCHESTER , N.H. — Republicans eyeing the 2016 White House race battered President Barack Obama 's health care law and nicked each other Saturday , auditioning before a high-profile gathering of conservatives that some political veterans said marked the campaign 's unofficial start .A speaking program packed with potential presidential candidates weighed in on the House Republicans ' controversial budget , the party 's struggle with Hispanics , the GOP 's future and the upcoming midterm elections while taking turns on a conference room stage facing hundreds of conservative activists gathered in New Hampshire 's largest city .But the Republican Party 's near-universal opposition to the president 's health care law dominated the conversation just days after Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius resigned after leading the rocky rollout of the program derided as `` Obamacare . ''Texas Sen. Ted Cruz declared that one resignation is not enough . `` We are going to repeal every single word of Obamacare , '' said the first-term senator and tea party favorite .Another tea party favorite , Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul , insisted that the GOP must broaden its appeal in order to grow . The Republican Party , he said , can not be a party of `` fat cats , rich people and Wall Street . ''Neither Paul nor Cruz defended the sweeping budget plan authored by another potential presidential contender , Rep. Paul Ryan , R-Wis . The budget , approved by the Republican-led House in recent days , transforms entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid to help reduce federal spending .Former Arkansas Gov . Mike Huckabee said the Ryan plan was simply `` a starting point , '' but that , `` there would be some things I 'd probably change , '' declining to be more specific .Another high-profile Republican , real estate mogul Donald Trump , was more critical .`` His whole stance is to knock the hell out of Medicare , Medicaid and Social Security , '' Trump said of Ryan . `` I would leave it alone . I do n't want to hurt people . ''The summit comes as prospective presidential candidates begin to step up appearances in key states ahead of the 2016 presidential contest , even though New Hampshire 's first-in-the-nation presidential primary is n't planned for another two years .`` It 's the unofficial kickoff of the 2016 process , '' said Republican operative Mike Biundo , who managed Rick Santorum 's last presidential campaign .As potential presidential candidates jockey for position , the stakes are high for the November 's midterm elections , where Republicans are fighting to claim the Senate majority . The president 's health care law could figure prominently in November House and Senate contests across the country .The industrialist Koch brothers-affiliated Americans for Prosperity , which co-hosted Saturday 's summit , has already spent millions of dollars on health care-related attack ads aimed at vulnerable Democratic senators in New Hampshire , North Carolina , Alaska , Colorado , Iowa and elsewhere .Sebelius resigned on Friday , days after the Obama administration announced that enrollment in the Affordable Care Act had grown to 7.5 million , a figure that exceeded expectations and gave Democrats a surprise success after a disastrous rollout . It was welcome news for Democrats who 've been forced to defend their support for the unpopular law .In a conference call , Rep. Chris Van Hollen , D-Md. , insisted that `` Democrats are not running away from the Affordable Care Act . ''Democratic National Committee spokesman Mike Czin noted that Republican opposition to the health care law was the foundation of the GOP 's unsuccessful political strategy in 2012 . He said that the debate has changed now that the law has been implemented and millions of people are enjoying its benefits .`` That 's a debate that we 're going to have , and we 're eager to have , '' Czin said .At the same time , Van Hollen , the senior Democrat on the House Budget Committee , called for Republicans to defend their support for a GOP budget plan introduced this week that would repeal the health care law , transform Medicare , reintroduce the `` doughnut hole '' for prescription drug costs and enact deep cuts in education .Trump , who says he 's also considering a Republican presidential bid , echoed many of the Democrats ' concerns . `` Leave my Medicare alone , '' he declared .Campaigning in Iowa the night before , Ryan defended his recently passed budget plan as a sign of growing GOP unity .`` Some people wanted to go further , some people thought it went too far . The point is we unified around these common principles in a plan , '' the Wisconsin congressman said after headlining an Iowa GOP dinner . `` That 's very important to me — which is we ca n't just oppose , we have to propose . ''Back in New Hampshire , conservatives also criticized another potential presidential contender who was not in attendance , former Florida Gov . Jeb Bush , who recently suggested that many immigrants enter the United States illegally because of love for their families .Trump described Bush 's suggestion as `` out there . ''
MANCHESTER , N.H. — Ted Cruz says he 's optimistic about the country 's future .The health care law — well , that 's another story .The Texas senator — a possible 2016 presidential candidate — spoke before a group of conservatives in New Hampshire on Saturday .He offered a plan for change that included standing for liberty , growth and opportunity , and empowering people .Cruz cited his father , who escaped from Communist Cuba at age 18 .Cruz compared the hardships his father faced as a teenage immigrant with the difficulties today 's young people have finding a job — something the senator blamed on President Barack Obama 's policies .Cruz ' father later immigrated to Canada , where Cruz was born .Cruz also pledged to `` repeal every single word of Obamacare .

MANITOU SPRINGS , Colo. — It was warm and sunny and smelled of cinnamon-orange tea inside a roadside cafe here in the mountains , but as a dozen Democrats waited for Senator Mark Udall’s campaign bus to arrive for a last-minute pep rally , the air was laced with dread .In the final polls before Election Day , Mr. Udall was trailing his Republican challenger , Representative Cory Gardner . Early voter returns tracking Colorado’s first major election run entirely through mail-in ballots showed that Republicans had turned in 104,000 more ballots than Democrats , though they were hoping to close the gap .Democrats had spent the campaign assailing Mr. Gardner’s positions on abortion and birth control , trying to paint him as a Cro-Magnon opponent of women’s reproductive rights — was their strategy failing them ?“I’m really worried about Gardner and Udall , ” said Michael Merrifield , a Democrat running for a State Senate seat , who attended the Udall rally . “I’ve even had Democrats say to me , ‘I’m just tired of hearing about the women’s issue.’ ”“I live in a Democratic district , ” said Alma Cremonesi , a property manager in nearby Colorado Springs . “They’re not voting.”Ms. Cremonesi said she had a thick stack of papers with the names and contact information of hundreds of likely Democratic voters — the fruits of sophisticated voter turnout operations that in recent years have helped push Democrats over the top here and in tight elections across the country . There are about 600 registered Democrats in her precinct , and Ms. Cremonesi said her job was to reach the 400 who had not yet mailed in their ballots . “It was really overwhelming , ” she said .Years of Republican stumbles , combined with booming growth along the diverse and increasingly urban Front Range of the Rocky Mountains , have helped Democrats turn this state’s political roster as blue as the cloudless sky on this autumn morning . Democrats control both Senate seats and the governor’s mansion , and have majorities in both chambers of the state legislature . But this year , Republicans believe they can ride a wave of voter discontent — with new gun-control laws , health care reform and an uneven economic recovery — back into power .“Let’s claw back that lost territory , ” Bob Beauprez , the Republican hoping to unseat Gov . John W. Hickenlooper , said at a rally last week . “Let’s make Colorado a red state again.”As the campaign closes , Democrats are still trying to convince voters that Mr. Gardner is more conservative than the earnest , grinning Republican who has lofted ahead in polls and won an endorsement from The Denver Post . Speaking to students on the campus of Colorado College , in Colorado Springs , Mr. Udall pointed out that Mr. Gardner opposes same-sex marriage , and said Mr. Gardner’s positions on climate change , renewable energy and college loans showed no vision for the future .As he does at many stops , Mr. Udall brought up his passion for mountain climbing to describe what has become a bitter , high-spending race . “You don’t schmooze your way up a mountain , ” he said . “You don’t climb it by accident . You don’t trash-talk your way up a mountain . You just go climb it.”The airwaves are a blizzard of Senate campaign ads — more than 55,000 have aired since January 2013 , according to the Wesleyan Media Project . High-powered proxies are flying in to rouse the faithful . Bill Clinton , Michelle Obama and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts have come out for Mr. Udall . Jeb Bush , the former governor of Florida , and Gov . Chris Christie of New Jersey are stumping for Republicans .Last week , dozens of Republican volunteers packed Mr. Gardner’s campaign offices in the college towns of Boulder and Fort Collins to get a handshake or selfie with the amped-up candidate . Spotting a boy in a Denver Broncos football jersey , Mr. Gardner whipped out his cellphone and showed him a photo of John Elway , the Broncos’ general manager and Hall of Fame quarterback , who has donated to Mr. Gardner’s campaign .The boy’s father , Dave Holdbrook , a truck driver who has been on disability for several years after a job-related injury , said he had already mailed in his ballot for Mr. Gardner .“I’m really concerned about what’s going to happen with Obamacare , ” he said . “Spending’s just out of control , and Udall’s lined up with Obama 100 percent of the way.”Mr. Gardner , pivoting between reporters , voters and volunteers , offered a rapid-fire recitation of his case against the Democrats : Mr. Udall is a “social-issues warrior” who does not represent the entire state’s values . The economic recovery may have cut unemployment to 4.7 percent in Colorado , but it has left too many people behind , especially in cities like Pueblo and Colorado Springs . Government is choking off small businesses . Coloradans are working harder and harder and falling further behind . People in much of the state feel they have been forgotten . “There should never be a forgotten Colorado , ” Mr. Gardner said .Outside his Boulder office , a group of students supporting immigration reform lined up to heckle Mr. Gardner about his opposition to granting citizenship to undocumented immigrants . Republican volunteers faced them down , shouting : “Udall lies ! ” and “Detect ! Detain ! Deport ! ”Mr. Gardner had long since left , but the two sides kept yelling at each other as the sun sank behind the mountains .
MIAMI — Most uninsured adult Americans lack basic knowledge about President Barack Obama 's signature healthcare law and have n't visited their online insurance marketplace because they think health insurance is unaffordable , according to a survey released on Thursday .The survey from Enroll America , a non-profit healthcare enrollment coalition , found that 68 percent of uninsured adults had not yet logged onto their online exchanges .A similar number , 69 percent of the uninsured , still lacked knowledge about tax subsidies and other financial help designed to make the Affordable Care Act , better known as Obamacare , affordable for many , the survey said .`` Large proportions of the uninsured are also still in the dark about deadlines and that brand new plans are available , '' Enroll America said in a report about the survey .`` A lack of facts about costs and coverage may be the greatest barriers to enrollment , '' it added .The law is expected to reduce the number of uninsured in the United States by almost half , or about 25 million people , in the next 10 years .As many as 7 million people are expected to buy insurance on the state exchanges and 8.7 million new beneficiaries are expected to enroll in Medicaid in 2014 alone .The administration , however , appears to be far behind in meeting its enrollment goals .Anne Filipic , the president of Enroll America , told reporters in a conference call about the survey that more than 2 million uninsured Americans have signed up for plans through state and federal exchanges so far .The nationwide survey of 910 adults was conducted December 12-22 by PerryUndem Research/Communication and had a margin of error of 4.3 percentage points .It found that eight in 10 uninsured adults were unaware of the need to sign up for insurance by March to avoid a fine , under the so-called individual mandate .Forty-three percent of Latinos participating in the survey said they were n't aware of the federally managed Healthcare.gov website . Only 25 percent of blacks and 21 percent of Latinos said they visited the website , compared with 30 percent of whites .In response to the survey , Enroll America said it was hiring 60 more staffers in 11 states to get its message out , sending them to supermarkets and churches to connect with more people while seeking volunteers to serve as `` ambassadors '' for Obamacare .`` Greater awareness and education about financial help and addressing cost concerns may be effective ways to boost enrollment for the remainder of the period , '' the coalition said( Additional reporting and writing by Tom Brown ; Editing by David Adams and Jan Paschal )
MIAMI — Over scrambled eggs and croquettes , Andres Malave gave a last-minute pep talk to about a dozen volunteers in a Cuban restaurant before they left to meet voters .`` Do n't just deliver a message , '' he said before beginning his own 3½-hour shift knocking on doors . `` Try to get them engaged . ''It 's a strategy playing out in New England diners , Midwest truck stops and West Coast cafes : conservative organizers train and send out thousands of volunteers holding an iPad and an interest in helping fellow activists shift America 's politics to the right .They are the backbone of Americans for Prosperity , the flagship organization of the political network backed by industrialist billionaires Charles and David Koch . While the group 's spending in Senate races has attracted national attention , it 's these less noticed field efforts that could have greater impact and help reshape the Republican Party heading into the 2016 presidential election .The organization has more than 500 paid workers in 35 states and has become one of the conservative movement 's best organized , most powerful outside groups . Building on the community-based approach President Barack Obama used successfully in 2008 and 2012 , it now has a political footprint unmatched among GOP-affiliated operations and is racking up legislative victories .The group scuttled efforts to raise taxes to build a downtown campus for the well-regarded zoo in Columbus , Ohio , and derailed plans in Florida 's Legislature to subsidize improvements to the Miami Dolphins ' football stadium . It helped fend off a recall effort against Gov . Scott Walker , R-Wis. , and pushed pro-business workplace laws in Michigan and Indiana .It did n't shy away from going after traditional allies , as was the case when Gov . Rick Scott , R-Fla. , briefly considered expanding Medicaid , a core component of Obama 's health care law . Americans for Prosperity mobilized supporters , the Republican-led Legislature quickly rejected the idea and Scott dropped his proposal .Tim Phillips , the group 's president , said Americans for Prosperity had helped usher in `` a once-in-a-generation renaissance for economic freedom policies , '' and was poised to keep financial issues prominent in 2016 .`` For the first time , we have the infrastructure on our side to sustain these policy battles , '' he said .This fall , Americans for Prosperity is campaigning against a sales tax increase in South Carolina 's Greenville County , as well as trying to elect conservatives to office . Unlike what it has done for most of this year , the group now is engaging in explicitly political messages for the campaign 's final weeks .Potential presidential contenders have taken notice .GOP Sens . Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of Texas spoke at the group 's annual summit in August . Sen. Marco Rubio , R-Fla. , headlined the Koch brothers ' seminar for major conservative donors this year .Americans for Prosperity sprung up in 2004 but has gained heft during the past two election cycles . Its budget has grown from less than $ 3 million in 2004 to more than $ 130 million for the 2012 election cycle .In many places , the group has more trained and paid operatives than the traditional political parties have . Nowhere is this more obvious than Florida , where the group has 10 offices , its single largest field operation .In the group 's Orlando outpost , Phillips recently met with 15 volunteers who were wearing bright green T-shirts with Americans for Prosperity 's torch logo .Using iPads , they had spent the morning asking voters to take an issues survey that included the federal health law , government spending and taxes . The information helps them develop messages and test which arguments resonate with voters .`` That does n't mean always knocking on the door and telling people 'Obamacare ' is bad , '' Phillips told the volunteers . `` That 's important , but the goal is to bring some good and build relationships over the long term . ''That strategy has become central to the Koch network of organizations . This year , they are trying to help Republicans pick up the six seats they need to win control of the Senate — Americans for Prosperity spent $ 25 million on TV ads alone — but it is not what drives the organization .`` People say our biggest goal is a Republican Senate . Not true , '' Phillips said . `` Florida is our biggest imprint . ''As the Nov. 4 vote nears , it 's all about voter-to-voter contacts , relationships that could pay dividends in 2016 and beyond .That means sending hundreds of staff and volunteers into neighborhoods , like the one in Miami packed with pastel homes with Spanish-tile roofs .Malave , the group 's Hispanic outreach chief in Florida , spent more than three hours knocking on doors in the scorching sun on a recent Tuesday . He kept asking the questions and punching in the answers on his iPad so leaders at headquarters could figure out which messages were working .Reaction from voters was mixed and answers came in a blend of English and Spanish . But , as Malave asked about the health law and government spending , he found a few potential recruits .`` I 'm a registered Democrat , '' one woman told Malave , `` but with the situation going on , I 'm in the middle . ''Malave recorded the answers and moved to the next house .`` This is n't glamorous work , '' Malave said , sweating through a polo shirt . `` But you 've got to go where the folks are . People are n't going to come to you . ''___Elliott reported from Washington .___
MIAMI — When Florida 's Republican governor , Rick Scott , walked into a bustling campaign field office late last month in Hialeah , a heavily Hispanic suburb of Miami , he was mobbed by volunteers hoping to be photographed with the candidate .`` Hey , beautiful , I got a lot of votes for you today , '' called out Rosa Peralta , a retired Cuban immigrant with accented English sitting by a phone bank with a plate of Cuban pastries .Scott 's campaign is making an unprecedented push for Hispanic votes in this year 's gubernatorial race in the nation 's largest swing state . The failure to pay enough attention to the fastest-growing segment of the state 's electorate may have cost the party victory in Florida in the 2012 presidential election , Republican leaders acknowledge .`` We made a point from Day One to make a Hispanic component part of everything we do on the campaign . Not just in Miami but all across the state , '' said Tim Saler , Scott 's deputy campaign manager .If the Republican strategy succeeds , it will signal a major turning back of a trend , with Hispanics favoring Democrats in recent years - and will likely spell defeat for Scott 's Democratic rival , former Governor Charlie Crist .Republicans have always been able to count on older Cuban voters like Peralta , 73 , who fled the Fidel Castro-led revolution in 1960 . But analysts question whether they have done enough to woo non-Cuban Hispanics , including a large influx of Democrat-leaning Puerto Ricans , as well as half a million lower-income Cuban immigrants over the past decade .`` Hispanics are really coming into the Florida electorate at a very fast rate , and they are much more likely to register Democrat , '' said Matt Barreto , a political scientist at the University of Washington and co-founder of the polling and research firm Latino Decisions .Since Scott squeaked out a 60,000-vote victory in 2010 over Democrat Alex Sink , the former state chief financial officer , some 714,000 voters had been added to the electorate , according to the Florida Division of Elections .Of those , 310,000 , or about 44 percent , are Hispanic , even though they make up only 17 percent of the state 's 12 million voters . Whites accounted for less than 25 percent of new registrations , though they represent more than 65 percent of the voting population .Among Hispanic registered voters , 471,000 are Republicans and 662,000 are Democrats , a wider gap - more than 11 percent - than in 2010 , according to a report by the Pew Hispanic Trust .That may explain why Scott mounted the biggest and earliest Spanish-language TV ad campaign in Florida history , starting in April . He even took some language classes and regularly breaks into halting Spanish at campaign stops .This week his campaign began running ads in which former Governor Jeb Bush , a fluent Spanish speaker with a Mexican-born wife , urges people to vote for the Republican who produces `` resultados . ''Both Scott and Crist have Hispanic running mates , another Florida first , each drawing from their strengths in South Florida 's Hispanic community .Scott picked a Cuban American , Carlos Lopez-Cantera , a state legislator from Miami well known in conservative Cuban circles , while Crist chose a Colombian-Jewish businesswoman , Annette Taddeo , also from Miami .Crist holds a 53-29 percent lead over Scott among Hispanics , according to a recent poll by Latino Decisions , suggesting Scott 's campaign has made few inroads .Democrats are counting on new Hispanic neighborhoods in central Florida such as Buenaventura Lakes , a fast-growing community of middle-class Puerto Ricans .Miguel Fontanez , 26 , owner of Pioco’s Chicken Deli & Bakery , said Scott’s budget cuts have hurt needy kids in Buenaventura Lakes .“Back when Charlie Crist was running it , there was more money for kids , ” he said .In this region , the Affordable Care Act , known as Obamacare , is far more popular than with white voters , and the Republican-dominated state legislature 's decision to reject federally subsidized Medicaid expansion does not sit well .Democrats say Republicans have failed to tailor their message to Hispanics , focusing on economic issues such as economic growth , job creation and more affordable college tuition .`` Our message does n't change depending on what demographic we are talking to , '' said Lopez-Cantera during a morning of campaign stops in Miami visiting Medicare health centers . `` I just say it in Spanish . ''Democrats take the opposite tack and say the state 's lower-income Hispanics have different priorities , highlighting Scott 's slashing of funding for education in his first year in office .`` I speak the language , but in the end if you don’t believe in certain things like public education you aren’t going to appeal to the ( Hispanic ) community , '' said Taddeo .( Addtional reporting by Barbara Liston .

MIAMI — With the promise of affordable health insurance under President Barack Obama 's law , many Americans with serious illnesses are finding relatively low monthly premiums and , in many cases , access to insurance for the first time .But some have been shocked at how much their prescriptions are costing as insurers are creating complex drug tiers and in some cases charging co-insurance rates as high as 50 percent , leaving patients on the hook for thousands .Avalere Health , a market research and consulting firm , estimates some consumers will pay 50 percent of the cost of their specialty drugs — that compares to about 30 percent in the private market .
MILWAUKEE — A federal judge has thrown out a U.S . Senator 's legal challenge to a part of President Barack Obama 's healthcare law that grants health insurance subsidies for members of Congress and their staffs .U.S . Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin had challenged the right of the federal government to continue making employer contributions to Congressional health insurance plans even when lawmakers and their staff purchase coverage through new Obamacare online exchanges .U.S. District Judge William Griesbach , in Green Bay , dismissed the lawsuit on Monday , saying Johnson had failed to show he had been harmed by the regulation .`` There is nothing in the Constitution stipulating that all wrongs must have remedies , much less that the remedy must lie in federal court , '' Griesbach , who was appointed by former President George W. Bush , said in his decision .The 2010 Affordable Care Act , commonly known as Obamacare , has been the subject of years of political and legal attacks by Republicans , including unsuccessful bids to repeal it .Monday 's ruling comes less than four months before elections in which Republicans seek to expand their House majority and win control of the Senate from Obama 's fellow Democrats .After the ruling , Johnson said he still believed the Obama administration was exceeding its legal authority .`` ( It ) violated its own signature healthcare law by giving special treatment to members of Congress and their staffs , '' he said in a statement .`` I believe that this executive action by the Obama administration is unlawful and unfair , and that it is only one of many examples of this president 's abuse of his constitutional duty . ''The U.S. Supreme Court , in a 2012 ruling , upheld the law 's `` individual mandate '' , a core provision requiring most Americans obtain health insurance by 2014 or pay a penalty .The law also created new online marketplaces where Americans can shop for and buy insurance , with the goal of expanding coverage for uninsured and underinsured people .
MINNEAPOLIS — Minnesota Democrats Governor Mark Dayton and Senator Al Franken bucked a national trend on Tuesday , winning election to second terms as Republicans clinched a majority in the U.S. Senate and rolled to gubernatorial victories , Reuters/Ipsos projected .Dayton , 67 , defeated county commissioner Jeff Johnson and Franken , who won election to the Senate by just 312 votes six years ago , had a 200,000 vote margin on challenger Mike McFadden with most precincts reporting .`` Minnesotans did n't know what to expect of me when I went to the Senate . But they saw me work hard , '' Franken told reporters when asked why his margin was so much stronger this year after thanking supporters for taking a chance on him six years ago .Dayton , a former U.S. senator who was narrowly elected governor four years ago , campaigned on his move to raise the state 's minimum wage , fund all-day kindergarten and eliminate a state budget deficit .`` I 've supported the causes I believe in , '' Dayton told supporters . `` I will remain true to those causes and principles , always . ''Johnson , 47 , a former corporate lawyer at Cargill and a county commissioner , criticized Dayton 's rollout of the state 's healthcare website . As a county commissioner , Johnson often voted against spending projects , including a light-rail line .Dayton in his first term successfully pressed for a new Minnesota Vikings football stadium , which is now under construction and scheduled to host a Super Bowl in four years , and other projects .Although best known as a comedian and writer for `` Saturday Night Live , '' Franken , 63 , served his first term as a low-key senator and a vocal opponent of a U.S. Supreme Court decision that gave corporations greater political freedom in campaigns .McFadden , 50 , a former investment banker , sought to gain name recognition with television commercials that depicted him as an everyday guy .In one ad , McFadden pretended to coach preteen football players who tell viewers `` Washington is fumbling our future '' and `` Obamacare needs to be sacked .

MONTGOMERY , Ala. — State Sen. Billy Beasley says it was the highest of compliments when a friend recently called him a `` true Democrat . ''The 74-year-old pharmacist also might soon be the only white Democrat left in the Alabama Senate , unless 30-year veteran Sen. Roger Bedford can make up a 60-vote deficit in an anticipated election recount .White , Deep South Democrats have been on the decline for years , and none remain in Congress after Rep. John Barrow of Georgia was defeated Nov. 4 . Their demise was perhaps nowhere more apparent than at the Alabama Statehouse , where the number of white Democrats in the 140-member legislature was cut in half from 14 to 7 on Election Day .`` They are not extinct . You can find some examples , but you really almost need a magnifying glass to find the Caucasian Democratic candidate , '' Jess Brown , a political scientist at Athens State University , said .Democrats dominated the so-called Solid South from Reconstruction to the middle of the twentieth century .The realignment began with Southerners ' opposition to the Civil Rights Act 1964 . What followed was a Goldwater-wave of several Southern states voting for Republicans ' presidential nominee for the first time . It was sped along with the popularity of President Ronald Reagan and Southerners ' identification with the GOP 's stances on issues from abortion to guns .`` Democrats , when they were winning , would often say to voters , we 're not like those national Democrats . But there was no alternative , '' said Natalie Davis , a political scientist and pollster at Birmingham-Southern College .Southern voters identify themselves with the Republican Party on issues across the board , from education and social issues to disdain for President Barack Obama 's signature health care law , said Alabama Republican Party Chairman Bill Armistead .`` The core of the Democratic Party has gotten more liberal , said Sen. Gerald Dial , a Lineville legislator who switched to the Republican Party .Dial represented his east Alabama district as a Democrat for 20 years before switching to the GOP in 2010 . He said the Republican Party better reflected the views of people in his district , which sweeps through east Alabama 's farms and textile mills .`` Our communities are just more conservative , very patriotic , very religious oriented - I guess we 've got more churches , I know I have a lot in my district . Add to that the philosophy of smaller government and low taxes , '' Dial said .Beasley said Republicans have successfully made state elections about national issues that legislators ca n't do anything about . `` They ran against Obama . They ran against ( House Minority Leader Nancy ) Pelosi and ( Senate Majority Leader Harry ) Reid . Those are national figures , '' Beasley said .He said state politicians should be talking about health care , education and jobs .Even as white Southerners began voting Republican in presidential and statewide races , statehouses had remained a Democratic stronghold until recently . Republicans won their first GOP majority since Reconstruction in 2010 . More Democrats abandoned their party to be part of the new ruling majority .The fall of white Democrats has resulted in parties that have become increasingly divided along party lines .`` Now we 've got down to a situation where you have blacks in the Democratic Party in the Legislature , at least in the Senate , and you have whites in the Republican Party . What that does it take us one step closer to the past , and that 's not good in my point of view , '' said Sen. Hank Sanders , D-Selma , who is black .Sanders said the result is that African-American voters feel the sting . The percentage of black legislators is roughly proportionate to the general population . But their party 's dwindling numbers means fewer opportunities for minority legislators to exert influence , he said .Beasley likely survived because he represents a district that is 60 percent black , as African-Americans are a reliably Democratic voting bloc .Democrats say they see hope for regaining ground in the region that spawned Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter .Part of the answer is getting beyond the presidency of Barack Obama , who is deeply unpopular among white voters in the South , said John Anzalone , an Alabama-based pollster and consultant . Anzalone has worked from Democrats ranging from President Barack Obama to Jason Carter , the grandson of Jimmy Carter who unsuccessfully ran this year for Georgia governor .`` There are a lot of non-college-educated , white Southern voters that agree with Democrats on a lot of issues like the minimum wage and access to health care , as long as you do n't call it Obamacare , '' Anzalone said .The GOP dominance means primary battles push some candidates further to the right , he said , which could provide an opening for Democrats if Republicans become even more conservative than their voting base .But as Democrats look for ways to regain white voters , Republicans are trying to court black voters .Several black Republicans ran for office this year , though all lost . Still , it 's likely an African-American Republican will be elected in the near future , predicted Phillip Brown , chairman of the Alabama Republican Minority Party . Brown ran for a seat on the state utility regulatory board and lost .`` We overcame a milestone this year , and that was to actually have a substantial number of minorities run under the banner of the Republican Party , '' Brown said .
Making good on a campaign promise , House Republicans will take a vote to repeal the Obama administration’s health care on Jan. 12 , the week after their party takes the reins of the House .“Obamacare is a job killer for businesses small and large , and the top priority for House Republicans is going to be to cut spending and grow the economy and jobs , ” said Brad Dayspring , a spokesman for Eric Cantor , the incoming majority leader . “Further , ObamaCare failed to lower costs as the president promised that it would and does not allow people to keep the care they currently have if they like it . That is why the House will repeal it next week.”In order to comply with new House rules governing transparency in bills , the new Republican Majority will post legislation to repeal the health care law Monday evening at http : //rules-republicans.house.gov/Default.aspx .House Democrats said they will defend the law , and Senate Democrats would almost certainly block a repeal bill from coming to a vote . Even if both the House and Senate were to approve a repeal , President Obama would veto such a bill . But the move is pregnant with symbolic meaning for Republicans , who have used the health-care law as a symbol of Democratic overreach and overspending
Many of us wish that Obamacare were a simpler system , one that directly provided health insurance . Political reality , unfortunately , ensured that many people will receive coverage from private insurers , selling policies — often with subsidies — on the “exchanges” . And naturally enough , the Obama administration is teaming up with the insurers and other parts of the health industry to help inform Americans of the benefits to which they will be legally entitled , starting Jan. 1 .And in the eyes of Republicans , Bloomberg reports , this makes Obama a “bully” — dragooning those private companies into helping sell a public program that will increase their profits . Why , it’s tyranny , I tell you !Yes , it’s ridiculous . But they can’t help themselves . I suspect that the idea of helping lower-income Americans in any way would drive the GOP bonkers ; but the idea that this help might come from Obama ( implementing a program originally designed by Republicans , but never mind ) , and that Obama’s plan might actually work , drives them crazy .
Matt Yglesias has kicked up a mini-commotion with a piece hailing any potential Obamacare-driven cuts to physician income as basically exactly the medicine our overpriced medical system needs . Here’s his argument:… American doctors get paid more than doctors in any other country . Given how much of health care is financed either directly ( Medicare , Medicaid , Veterans Affairs , public-sector workers ) or indirectly ( tax subsidy for employer-provided insurance ) by the federal government , it’s natural to make restraining doctors’ income part of any program for making health care more affordable . So when you read stories about doctors whining that Affordable Care Act exchange plans don’t pay them enough , please throw up a little in your mouth and proceed to ignore the doctors’ complaints . The only practical reason to worry about low compensation for doctors in the ACA exchanges is it may cause them to boycott exchange patients . If that happens , the solution is to reduce doctors’ payment rates elsewhere in the system . If we ever reach the point where American doctors have been squeezed so badly that they start fleeing north of the border to get higher pay in Canada , then we’ve squeezed too hard . Until that happens , forget about it .… What we really ought to be doing is working to further pressure the incomes of doctors through supply-side reforms . That means letting nurse practitioners treat patients without kicking a slice upstairs to an M.D. , letting more doctors immigrate to the United States , and opening more medical schools . Common sense says that since the population both grows and ages over time , there should be more people admitted to medical school today than were 30 years ago . But that’s not the case . Instead we produce roughly the same number of new doctors , admissions standards have gotten tougher , and doctors have become scarcer .You’ll note a slight difference in both tone and substance between the first paragraph ( where Yglesias sounds like , shall we say , a particularly hepped-up MSNBC host ranting against the selfish Republican-voting rich ) and the second paragraph ( where he sounds more like Milton Friedman , who once described of the American Medical Association as “the strongest trade union in the United States” ) . For a heterodox liberal writing mostly for mostly partisan audience , it’s a savvy way to structure an argument : Come for the defense of the Affordable Care Act ( and to watch the outrage from conservatives who like their doctor and mistakenly imagine that ours is a free market in medical services ) , and stay for a little unconventional , even right-of-center wisdom about the problem with government-subsidized cartels and the uses of deregulation .But I’m not sure the combination holds together analytically . If supply-side reforms are the real answer to the problem of inflated medical salaries ( and I’m pretty sure they are ) then should we be praising a policy , Obamacare , that tries to restrain salaries and payments by fiat instead ? Jokes about doctors fleeing to Canada notwithstanding , unless Democrats have a plan to completely nationalize health care there’s still going to be somewhere else for the best physicians to go : They can stop participating in public plans , stop participating in exchange plans , and and then eventually stop taking insurance entirely and just opt to serve an exclusively upper middle class clientele via concierge medicine . And if you combine this opting-opt out at the top of the talent distribution with the fact that Obamacare will presumably dramatically expand the demand for physician services for the newly-subsidized , you have a recipe for basically importing Medicaid’s existing access and quality-of-care problems into the rest of the publicly-subsidized insurance market .Would this shift also restrain doctor salaries ( or the average doctor’s salary , at least ) , and with them , medical costs ? Well , yes , to some extent it might — and so in a sense , this is just taking us back into the ideologically-charged debate over whether “Medicaid for all” would be a good idea or not . But it’s noteworthy that Yglesias’s nominally liberal and pro-Obamacare piece actually suggests a very different prescription ( and yes , admittedly , one that many A.M.A.-funded Republicans would oppose ) than the Medicaid-for-most model that Obamacare might end up delivering . He’s basically acknowledging that what we actually need is medical-industry deregulation to counteract the market-distorting impact of a heavily-subsidized medical cartel , but then still embracing as a second-best option a policy that answers that cartel with wage and price controls instead , essentially piling a new set of distortions on top of the old set in the hopes that they cancel each other out . And given his own analysis of the underlying dynamics , I think it’s reasonable to doubt whether that second-best solution is really much of a solution at all .
Midterm election season is , for many , mercifully approaching the finish line . Looking ahead to 2015 , if poll averages are correct and Republicans do take control of the Senate — Vox.com’s average of several sites puts it at a 68 percent chance of happening — what can Americans expect ?More of the same — of the wildly unpopular grind — is entirely possible . “After all , we have divided government now , and we will still have divided government if Republicans go from 45 senators to 51 . Obama will still be in the White House , and the House of Representatives will still belong to the GOP , ” Molly Ball writes for The Atlantic .But perhaps surprisingly , many observers suggest that we could alternatively expect quite a lot — at least by the standards of the past few years , i.e. , a “sinkhole of inaction , ” in the words of Howard Fineman . And many point to election year 2016 as the motivating factor .“Regaining the Senate would finally give the G.O.P . the opportunity , going into 2016 , to demonstrate its capacity to govern , ” Charles Krauthammer writes at The Washington Post .And the White House , according to reporting from Edward-Isaac Dovere at Politico , also sees some 2016 leverage , pointing to the Repubilcan senators up for re-election that year .“As bad as the electoral map for Democrats is this year , the map for Republicans in 2016 is even worse , ” Mr. Dovere writes . The vulnerable Republican senators “would be under pressure to move toward the middle and be the bridge to larger deals with a caucus eager to show it can get things done.”For the Republicans , Mr. Krauthammer urges them to enact a bold “reform agenda” and “dare the president to veto it . Show the country what you stand for . Then take it to the nation in 2016.” This could include tax reform ( corporate and individual ) , border security , energy deregulation and health care .Others have pointed to potential areas of deal making like trade pacts , such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership , and infrastructure — at least the Keystone XL pipeline .The theory being , according Ms. Ball , that “Republicans will stop the Obama agenda by proposing their own agenda — one that’s realistic and palatable enough that Obama will agree to it.”And at the center of any deal making — assuming he wins his re-election race and becomes majority leader — is Mitch McConnell . The Kentucky senator emphasized this aspect in a recent debate with his Democratic opponent , Alison Lundergan Grimes : “There have been three major bipartisan agreements during the Obama years between Republicans and Democrats , ” Mr. McConnell said . “The vice president and I have negotiated every one of them” ( these were the 2010 deal to extend the Bush tax cuts , the 2011 deal to raise the debt ceiling and fiscal-cliff deal of 2013 ) .George Will at The Washington Post sees Mr. McConnell’s role as central to what he sees as the restoration of the Senate to its rightful place in the Washington firmament : “In January , in the most statesmanlike Senate speech in years , McConnell explained how , under Republican leadership , the Senate would be restored as the creator of consensus:“An executive order can’t [ create consensus ] . The fiat of a nine-person court can’t do it . A raucous and precarious partisan majority in the House can’t do it . The only institution that can make stable and enduring laws is the one we have in which all 50 states are represented equally , and where every single senator has a say in the laws that we pass.”Yet other observers do not see Mr. McConnell and his leadership with quite the same glow . Jonathan Chait at New York magazine has seen the same speeches as Mr. Will — particular Mr. McConnell’s view of Senate rule changes under Harry Reid , the current majority leader — but does not find them nearly as convincingly sanguine . He writes : “The source of McConnell’s apparent indignation is changes made to Senate rules by Reid . The Democratic leader has made it hard for Republicans to amend legislation , forcing them into up-or-down votes on bills of Reid’s choosing . And more provocative , he eliminated the filibuster on federal court nominations and executive branch appointments . McConnell claims he will undo this , restoring the Senate to its grandeur.”It is possible McConnell actually believes this , Mr. Chait says , but “there is almost no chance he will follow through on it.” He writes , “The reason the majority party likes to control what bills and amendments can come to the floor is that it prefers to highlight issues where it holds a political advantage and obscure issues where their opponents do.”Annie Lowrey , also at New York magazine , sees much less “creator of consensus” and much more manager of conflict between parties . She sees Republicans unable to pass legislation — Democrats could filibuster in the Senate or the president could veto any bill — without compromise . But there’s still a way for Republicans to get their priorities onto President Obama’s desk , she writes : “They can attach them to budget legislation and pass it through a process immune to the filibuster known as ‘reconciliation.’“President Obama is faced with the choice of approving a budget larded with Republican priorities he hates , or using his veto power — and thus potentially shutting down the government or even precipitating another debt-ceiling crisis , ” Ms. Lowrey says .Steven Mufson at The Washington Post also sees partisan strife : “The Republican plan for next year isn’t about congressional harmony but is mainly aimed at discrediting the Obama record , defining a new conservative vision , and building an appealing Republican platform for the 2016 presidential election.”Ms. Lowrey concludes : “The next two years might look a lot like the last two years , with legislating grinding to a halt and the occasional shutdown or debt-ceiling scare . Democrats and Republicans agree on very little . There is scant evidence of anyone pivoting to the center . The choke points shift , but persist.”Some observers on the right don’t disagree with this but of course see it in a different light . Erick Erickson at Red State says , “The G.O.P . would be wise to target Obamacare for destruction and begin , finally , investigating the Obama Administration’s attempts to politicize all aspects of the federal bureaucracy .“Voters distrust big government , ” he adds . “Republicans should , assuming they win the Senate , begin exposing all the ills of Barack Obama’s big government.”Hugh Hewitt at Washington Examiner urges Republicans to act with true urgency and boldness if they win the Senate . “Pass the G.O.P . budget on day one , having negotiated its particulars between House and Senate GOP in November and December .“On day two , both Houses should pass a Defense Appropriations bill adequate to the pressing needs of the Pentagon — again negotiated between House and Senate during the two months between elections and the new Congress convening — and send it to the president , defining by deeds what makes the new G.O.P . Congress different from either divided government or the 2007 to 2010 years of Pelosi-Reid.”Yet should Republicans get ambitious , Ms. Ball sees an additional obstacle : “The biggest obstacle will be Republicans themselves — chiefly the restive conservatives in the House , who have prevented consideration of bipartisan legislation approved by the Senate on issues like immigration and who have often prevented the party from doing what’s in its own political interest ( see : government shutdown ) .”But first , Election Day , when questions of which party controls what are answered — or at least hopefully answered , unless it goes into overtime .
Mike Konczal says most of what needs to be said about the underlying sources of Obamacare’s complexity , which in turn set the stage for the current tech problems . Basically , Obamacare isn’t complicated because government social insurance programs have to be complicated : neither Social Security nor Medicare are complex in structure . It’s complicated because political constraints made a straightforward single-payer system unachievable .It’s been clear all along that the Affordable Care Act sets up a sort of Rube Goldberg device , a complicated system that in the end is supposed to more or less simulate the results of single-payer , but keeping private insurance companies in the mix and holding down the headline amount of government outlays through means-testing . This doesn’t make it unworkable : state exchanges are working , and healthcare.gov will probably get fixed before the whole thing kicks in . But it did make a botched rollout much more likely .So Konczal is right to say that the implementation problems aren’t revealing problems with the idea of social insurance ; they’re revealing the price we pay for insisting on keeping insurance companies in the mix , when they serve little useful purpose .So does this mean that liberals should have insisted on single-payer or nothing ? No . Single-payer wasn’t going to happen — partly because of the insurance lobby’s power , partly because voters wouldn’t have gone for a system that took away their existing coverage and replaced it with the unknown . Yes , Obamacare is a somewhat awkward kludge , but if that’s what it took to cover the uninsured , so be it .And although the botched rollout is infuriating — count me among those who believe that liberals best serve their own cause by admitting that , not trying to cover for the botch — the odds remain high that this will work , and make America a much better place .

Mitt Romney’s choice of Michael O.

Motif Investing , an upstart online broker , has attracted the nation’s biggest bank as a backer .JPMorgan Chase has joined with other firms to invest $ 35 million in Motif , the company announced on Thursday . The deal is a significant vote of confidence in Motif , which received an investment from Goldman Sachs last year .The investors in the financing round included Wicklow Capital , a fund formed by Daniel Tierney and Stephen Schuler . The two men co-founded the high-frequency trading firm Getco ( which merged with Knight Capital last year ) . Balderton Capital , a European venture capital firm , also invested .A representative of JPMorgan is expected to join Motif Investing’s board as a nonvoting member , the company said . The board also includes Sallie L. Krawcheck , a former big bank executive ; Arthur Levitt Jr. , a former Securities and Exchange Commission chairman ; and Darren W. Cohen , a Goldman managing director , who , like the JPMorgan representative , does not get to vote .While Motif Investing and JPMorgan declined to discuss details of their talks , the investment appears to be a strategic one . Motif may be hoping to gain access at some point to JPMorgan’s vast customer base .“It’s always helpful to have companies that understand the financial markets , that are serving on our board as observers , ” Hardeep Walia , the chief executive of Motif Investing , said in an interview . “There’s always value to having companies like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan.”Mr. Levitt , who works as an adviser to Goldman , put it this way : “Hardeep is mining the fields thoroughly in terms of seeing whether any of his investors are able to be strategic and create opportunities that are commercial , not merely passive investors.”Motif Investing , based in San Mateo , Calif. , opened its doors in 2012 . The company lets investors buy a basket of stocks centered on a theme , like “robotic revolution , ” “seven deadly sins” or “Obamacare” ( “Repeal Obamacare” is also available ) . Investors can also create their own themes . The company charges $ 9.95 for a so-called motif , a portfolio of up to 30 stocks .Separately on Thursday , the firm announced a new product geared toward financial advisers , offering a way for advisers to monitor and rebalance their clients’ portfolios . The service will charge advisers a monthly fee per customer .Phil Di Iorio , chief executive of JPMorgan’s global wealth management business , said in a statement that Motif “is driving powerful innovations in the wealth management segment.”Mr. Walia’s vision has clearly resonated with the bank . He posed for a picture recently with Jamie Dimon , JPMorgan’s chief executive , who was all smiles .
Much of the political chatter of the day has been about the impact of the Supreme Court’s ruling on the presidential campaign . But the court’s decision to let stand President Obama’s health care plan may hold even more import in the battle for control of the Senate .Republicans on Capitol Hill vowed on Thursday to repeal the health care law . But the truth is they can only do that if they control both chambers of Congress .In 2010 , anger over the health care law helped fuel a Republican wave that gave the party control of the House . If the court had overturned the health care law , that intensity might have faded .But now , conservative activists say they will be fired up again to do whatever is necessary to get rid of “Obamacare , ” and winning the Senate will be crucial . The could fuel a surge in attack ads about health care financed by third-party groups and aimed squarely at Democrats who voted for the health care law .“The last time Obamacare was litigated in a general election , Republicans picked up an historic number of seats in the U.S. House and made big gains in the U.S. Senate , ” said Jonathan Collegio , a spokesman for American Crossroads , a conservative group which that some health care ads in 2010 .He added : “The Supreme Court effectively made the 2012 elections the most important in a century , and dramatically energized the center-right coalition in the process.”The Senator majority leader , Harry Reid of Nevada , said on the Senate floor that Republicans should move past the issue .“It’s time , though , for Republicans to stop refighting yesterday’s battles , ” Mr. Reid said . “Now that this matter is settled , let’s move on to other things like jobs.”Judging from the reaction among conservative groups , that appears unlikely .
My Campaign Stops column this week discusses why Rick Santorum is proving a more troublesome adversary for the frontrunner than all the not-Romneys before him:… Santorum’s advantage is that he can get to Romney’s right and to his left at once . On the one hand , Santorum isn’t responsible for a health care bill that looks an awful lot like “Obamacare” and he doesn’t have a long list of social-issue flip-flops in his past . This makes his candidacy a plausible rallying point for the voters who previously turned Bachmann and Cain and the pre-debate Rick Perry into conservative flavors of the month .At the same time , though , Santorum’s persona , his record and his platform all have a populist tinge that plays well in states like Michigan , Ohio and Pennsylvania , where swing voters tend to be socially conservative but economically middle-of-the-road . ( Hence the Michigan poll that showed him leading among independents and Democrats who plan to vote in that state’s open primary . )This means that Santorum can play the same anti-Bain , anti-rich-guy , blue-collar card that Gingrich tried to play in New Hampshire and South Carolina – but subtly , implicitly , in ways that don’t make him sound like he belongs in Occupy Wall Street instead of the Republican primary .Read the rest here .
My Sunday column closed with a warning to conservatives that Obamacare — at least in some form — may turn out to be more durable than its disastrous rollout would seem to suggest , because the nature of the welfare state means that even programs that don’t live up to their promises can be awfully hard to dislodge . ( As a case in point , see the outcome of the weekend’s House election in Louisiana , where the anti-establishment , right-wing , “Duck Dynasty”-endorsed winner was also … in favor of Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion . )For an example of why conservatives should be interested in dislodging it , though , let me take up Jonathan Chait’s latest brief against the potential Republican alternatives to Obamacare , which he’s been arguing would necessarily be much more unpopular than the current , not-exactly-popular reform:The Republicans’ triumphant plan for ideological conquest ignores some massive obstacles . The first is that , while people with individual insurance may not like the prospect of losing their plan with no easily obtainable alternative , people with employer-based insurance like the prospect of losing their plan a lot less . Conservatives propose to cap the tax deduction for employer-based insurance … That sounds nice in theory . In reality , it means squeezing not millions but tens of millions of happily insured workers into skimpier plans , or plans with higher premiums , or onto the individual market . The scale of the disruption from that one change alone would dwarf the “keep your plan” complaints .Second , conservatives may prefer an individualized market where healthy people get cheap , bare-bones insurance . But Americans overwhelmingly prefer more comprehensive insurance . Employer-based insurance , which charges young , healthy workers the exact same rate as older , sicker ones , is the most redistributive form of insurance , and also the most popular kind by far …… The Republican plan is to move as many people as possible from the kind of insurance they like to the kind of insurance they hate . Obama’s plan is to make unpopular individual health insurance more like the popular employer-based health insurance , with lots of cross-subsidies from healthy to sick . The conservative plans propose to make popular employer insurance more like the unpopular individual market .I’ve already been over the issue of whether the cap-and-subsidize approach would actually be more disruptive than Obamacare , and at the very least it’s a harder question to answer than Chait breezily suggests ( not least because Obamacare also tries to cap the tax deduction , albeit in a much more limited way , and includes many other disruptive provisions as well ) . But his point about the popularity of employer-provided insurance deserves a response in its own right , because it cuts to the heart of what might turn out to be the perverse consequences of a fully-operational Obamacare .So it’s true , as Chait says , that people generally like employer-provided insurance , and that they like it , in part , because of the way risk pooling works in the employer market . But mostly they like it because , well , nobody realizes what their employer-provided insurance actually costs . As Josh Barro put it recently:… Conservatives like , for good reason , to talk about “fiscal illusion” : When the costs of government programs are hidden , people will tend to support them even if they are not worth the price . Because our system of health insurance contains so much cost shifting and so many hidden subsidies , we suffer from “premium illusion” : People love their employer-provided coverage because they have no idea how much it’s costing them .In other words , the individual market is relatively unpopular because it’s transparent and people pay up front , whereas the coverage that you get through your employer involves costs that people don’t see and don’t have a way to tally up — mostly because they come off the top of wages without the wage-earner actually realizing it’s happening . They may realize something is happening : The wage stagnation , driven in part by health care costs , that’s kept median incomes growing at an at-best-unimpressive pace since the 1970s is an important source of angst and insecurity and disillusionment and diminished expectations . But the link between wages and employer-provided health benefits , while significant , is not exactly widely understood … because , again , nobody knows what their employer-based insurance actually costs .So to say , as Chait does , that Obamacare will make the individual market “more like the popular employer-based health insurance” … well , in some ways it might , but given the employer market’s role as a driver of cost inflation that’s not necessarily an advertisement for the wisdom of the policy .It’s true that in the best-case scenario for the law , the employer market and the individual market would converge in a productive way : The Cadillac tax on high-value plans would make people in the employer market feel a little more of the real cost of insurance , the exchanges would create larger individual-market risk pools and more competition for individual-market dollars , and both sectors would end up looking a little bit more like the other in a positive-sum , cost-containing fashion . ( As I understand it , this is basically the scenario that Barro , a supporter of the law , is hoping for . )But the danger right now is that instead of this happy convergence , we’re going to get a worst-of-both-worlds scenario , in which the “reformed” individual market ends up taking on some of the pathologies of the employer market while also seeing its own existing problems exacerbated . By this I mean that the bottom , heavily-subsidized half of the individual market will end up sharing some of the cost-insulating features of employer-provided insurance , with buyers encouraged to choose plans without understanding their true price ( indeed , some of the website’s issues can be traced to the administration’s desire to make sure that shoppers don’t encounter the real unsubsidized prices of their plans ) , while the upper , unsubsidized half of the market gets an even rawer deal than they did before , with higher prices and fewer low-cost choices … and then that combination of cost insulation at the bottom and cost inflation at the top could drive out the healthy buyers the system needs , leaving a less sustainable risk pool than the individual market enjoyed before .If Obamacare ends up being a policy failure , in other words , it will because instead of building on the individual market’s strengths it exacerbated some of its weaknesses , and instead of finding most of its cost savings in the overly-subsidized employer market it loaded them onto the backs of individual-market buyers instead .Now maybe — hopefully — it won’t come to this . And if it does , I honestly don’t know how the politics of a Republican alternative that caps the employer deduction would play out , in 2016 and beyond : Maybe they would be so ugly , on the “like your plan/keep your plan” front , that the country would prefer to take a Medicaid-for-most road to single payer , or else just keep staggering along the path Obamacare is taking . But even in Chait’s ongoing defenses of the reform you can see some of the problems with that path , and the reasons that an alternative should at least be on the table .
My column for Sunday ( which is going up early ) is one that I wish I weren’t writing . It’s about my freshman roommate in college , Scott Androes , who lacked health insurance and preventive care and as a result is now fighting stage IV prostate cancer . It’s obviously a tragedy for Scott and those who hold him dear , but it’s also a reminder of how flawed our health care system is — and of the stakes in this election . Obamacare is far from perfect , but if President Obama is reelected , then beginning in 2014 people like Scott will end up insured through a mandate . If Mitt Romney is elected , then people like Scott will presumably remain uncovered and uninsurable . In the debates , you hear health numbers batted back and forth , but as I see it , what’s at stake is ultimately lives like Scott’s .Read the column , and I’d welcome your thoughts — and a special thanks to Scott for sharing his story , in hopes that it will make a difference to others . Fight on , Scott !
My parents used to own a small house with a large backyard , in which my mother cultivated a beautiful garden . At some point , however — I don’t remember why — my father looked at the official deed defining their property , and received a shock . According to the text , the Krugman lot wasn’t a rough rectangle ; it was a triangle more than a hundred feet long but only around a yard wide at the base .On examination , it was clear what had happened : Whoever wrote down the lot’s description had somehow skipped a clause . And of course the town clerk fixed the language . After all , it would have been ludicrous and cruel to take away most of my parents’ property on the basis of sloppy drafting , when the drafters’ intention was perfectly clear .But it now appears possible that the Supreme Court may be willing to deprive millions of Americans of health care on the basis of an equally obvious typo . And if you think this possibility has anything to do with serious legal reasoning , as opposed to rabid partisanship , I have a long , skinny , unbuildable piece of land you might want to buy .Last week the court shocked many observers by saying that it was willing to hear a case claiming that the wording of one clause in the Affordable Care Act sets drastic limits on subsidies to Americans who buy health insurance . It’s a ridiculous claim ; not only is it clear from everything else in the act that there was no intention to set such limits , you can ask the people who drafted the law what they intended , and it wasn’t what the plaintiffs claim . But the fact that the suit is ridiculous is no guarantee that it won’t succeed — not in an environment in which all too many Republican judges have made it clear that partisan loyalty trumps respect for the rule of law .To understand the issue , you need to understand the structure of health reform . The Affordable Care Act tries to establish more-or-less universal coverage through a “three-legged stool” of policies , all of which are needed to make the system work . First , insurance companies are no longer allowed to discriminate against Americans based on their medical history , so that they can’t deny coverage or impose exorbitant premiums on people with pre-existing conditions . Second , everyone is required to buy insurance , to ensure that the healthy don’t wait until they get sick to join up . Finally , there are subsidies to lower-income Americans to make the insurance they’re required to buy affordable .Just as an aside , so far this system seems to be working very well . Enrollment is running above expectations , premiums well below , and more insurance companies are flocking to the market .So what’s the problem ? To receive subsidies , Americans must buy insurance through so-called exchanges , government-run marketplaces . These exchanges , in turn , take two forms . Many states have chosen to run their own exchanges , like Covered California or Kentucky’s Kynect . Other states , however — mainly those under G.O.P . control — have refused to take an active role in insuring the uninsured , and defaulted to exchanges run by the federal government ( which are working well now that the original software problems have been resolved ) .But if you look at the specific language authorizing those subsidies , it could be taken — by an incredibly hostile reader — to say that they’re available only to Americans using state-run exchanges , not to those using the federal exchanges .As I said , everything else in the act makes it clear that this was not the drafters’ intention , and in any case you can ask them directly , and they’ll tell you that this was nothing but sloppy language . Furthermore , the consequences if the suit were to prevail would be grotesque . States like California that run their own exchanges would be unaffected . But in places like New Jersey , where G.O.P . politicians refused to take a role , premiums would soar , healthy individuals would drop out , and health reform would go into a death spiral . ( And since many people would lose crucial , lifesaving coverage , the deaths wouldn’t be just a metaphor . )Now , states could avoid this death spiral by establishing exchanges — which might involve nothing more than setting up links to the federal exchange . But how did we get to this point ?Once upon a time , this lawsuit would have been literally laughed out of court . Instead , however , it has actually been upheld in some lower courts , on straight party-line votes — and the willingness of the Supremes to hear it is a bad omen .So let’s be clear about what’s happening here . Judges who support this cruel absurdity aren’t stupid ; they know what they’re doing . What they are , instead , is corrupt , willing to pervert the law to serve political masters . And what we’ll find out in the months ahead is how deep the corruption goes .
NEW ORLEANS — Extending an expensive and largely negative campaign for one more month , voters in Louisiana sent Mary Landrieu , a Democrat and three-term United States senator , and her Republican challenger , United States Representative Bill Cassidy , into a runoff election set for Dec. 6 .Given Louisiana’s nonpartisan primary system — in which all candidates run in a primary and , if no one wins a majority , the top two vote-getters compete in an election a few weeks later — runoffs are fairly routine here and one had long been expected in this race .While the state Republican Party formally backed Mr. Cassidy this summer , another Republican , Rob Maness , a retired Air Force colonel with a strong Tea Party following , stayed in the race and drew about 14 percent of the vote on Tuesday . Mr , Cassidy received 42 percent of the vote and Ms. Landreau 41 percent .Numerous polls suggest that much of Mr. Maness’s support will move to Mr. Cassidy in the runoff , putting him in a strong position to win .Ms. Landrieu is the last Democrat representing a Deep South state in the United States Senate and the last Democrat in office in Louisiana to be elected statewide . She won runoffs in her first and second elections for the Senate , in 1996 and 2002 , though neither by huge margins . Given the rightward drift of the state , and particularly of the once reliably Democratic voters of southern Louisiana , Ms. Landrieu may be facing her toughest Senate election to date .“She’s got to find a way to get to 30 percent” of white voters , said Roy Fletcher , a Republican political consultant in Baton Rouge . “In this headwind , with Obama and et cetera , I’m not sure.”Her case to the voters has centered on her clout as a long-serving senator , particularly in securing funding for local projects and post-hurricane disaster aid . Highlighting her role as chairwoman of the Senate Energy Committee , she has drawn support and campaign donations from leading figures in the oil and gas industry . Ms. Landrieu has distanced herself from President Obama on energy issues , but Republicans have zeroed in on a number of votes that put her on the same side as the president , who is deeply unpopular here , most notably on the Affordable Care Act .“I think people are looking for change , ” said Stacy Crovetto , 55 , a retired schoolteacher who was voting at an elementary school in Luling , La. , midmorning . “I think health care is one of the biggest concerns . People are concerned about the changes that Obamacare has made.”Mr. Cassidy , a gastroenterologist turned congressman , run most of the race like a front-runner , keeping a relatively low profile and sticking to a script . In the two debates and in many of his campaign ads , Mr. Cassidy repeatedly tied Ms. Landrieu to Mr. Obama’s policies .
NEW ORLEANS — Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota , the latest candidate to join the Republican presidential campaign , suggested Friday that President Obama secretly wanted Medicare to go bankrupt so retirees would be forced to enroll in the new national health care law .“This hasn’t been talked about very much – the president’s plan for senior citizens is Obamacare , ” Ms. Bachmann told party activists here . She added , “I think very likely what the president intends is that Medicare will go broke and ultimately that answer will be Obamacare for senior citizens.”In a speech to the Republican Leadership Conference , Ms. Bachmann recounted how she attended a closed-door meeting at the White House and said the president was asked three times to produce his plan to address the financial burdens facing the Medicare program . She said the president’s “gift to senior citizens is to steal from them $ 500 billion out of Medicare.”The anecdote , which Ms. Bachmann did not explain in detail or offer additional corroboration , was the latest example of a red-meat , crowd-pleasing declaration that has become a theme of her political rise – whether or not the statements withstand scrutiny . She drew enthusiastic applause as she pledged that her top priority – should she reach the White House – would be repealing the health care law .“I wonder if they’re listening in the White House right now , ” Ms. Bachmann said . “You will , come November of 2012 , you’ll listen then.”Ms. Bachmann , Representative Ron Paul of Texas and former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania were among the Republican presidential candidates speaking Friday to hundreds of party activists here . Ms. Bachmann made repeated references to her performance Monday at the debate in New Hampshire , when she announced her candidacy and drew fresh attention to her bid .She infused humor throughout her speech , repeatedly bringing the audience to its feet .“I have to tell you I was a little nervous , ” Ms. Bachmann said . “I didn’t know if they were going to ask boxers or briefs – a girl never knows . You never know.”
NEW ORLEANS — The Louisiana U.S. Senate race is headed to a runoff in a closely watched contest that will test the viability of a southern Democrat in an increasingly conservative state .Democratic Senator Mary Landrieu , 58 , a third-term incumbent , and Republican U.S. Representative Bill Cassidy will face off again on Dec. 6 after neither won more than 50 percent of Tuesday 's vote , preliminary results showed .Landrieu , the only Democrat in Louisiana currently holding statewide elected office , received about 42 percent of the vote and was running neck-in-neck with Cassidy .`` This race is starting tonight , '' Landrieu told supporters . `` The question facing the voters in Louisiana will be a very simple one : which candidate has a proven track record ... and which candidate has a record of running scared . ''Cassidy , a medical doctor , refused to participate in several debates with Landrieu . He has sought to link Landrieu to President Barack Obama , who is deeply unpopular among whites in the state , citing in particular her support for the Affordable Care Act , or Obamacare .`` It 's going to come down to one fundamental issue -- do you want a senator who represents Barack Obama or a senator that represents you , '' he told an election night crowd .`` We have 32 more days . This is not over yet , '' he said , urging supporters to stay the course .Landrieu faces a difficult path to re-election , analysts have said . Her victory six years ago was helped by strong turnout by black voters in a presidential election year . Analysts said blacks were unlikely to vote in such high numbers in the runoff .Hurricane Katrina , which demonstrated Landrieu 's ability to steer large recovery funds to her state , is also no longer a fresh memory for many voters .With Republican Rob Maness , a retired U.S. Air Force colonel backed by the conservative Tea Party movement , now eliminated from the race , his backers could opt for Cassidy over Landrieu , who has campaigned on her clout as chairwoman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee .`` It 's high time for Mary Landrieu to go , '' Maness told supporters as he ran a distant third with about 14 percent of the early results .`` While we may have fallen short tonight , we shocked the establishment , the media , and we made D.C. listen , '' he said .Another runoff will decide the colorful race for Louisiana 's 6th Congressional District . Disgraced former Governor Edwin Edwards , a Democrat who served almost nine years in prison on public corruption charges , will go to a runoff with Republican Garrett Graves , who is a former top aide to Governor Bobby Jindal .( Additional reporting by Michael Flaherty in Washington ; Editing by Eric Beech , Letitia Stein and Peter Cooney )

NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) - When Massachusetts blazed the trail of healthcare reform in 2006 by expanding coverage for the poor and requiring all residents to have health insurance , it may have done more than serve as a model for nationwide reform : it also seemed to save lives , according to a study released on Monday .The findings , reported in the Annals of Internal Medicine , are the first to provide a detailed analysis of the effects of systematically expanding healthcare coverage . Increasing access to Medicaid , the government-run insurance program for the poor , and mandating that everyone have health insurance were the two centerpieces of Massachusetts ' healthcare reform .They are also central to President Barack Obama 's 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act , and remain its most controversial elements . Half the states have refused to expand Medicaid under the law known as Obamacare , for instance , and Republican opponents of the law regularly rail against the individual mandate requiring that individuals buy insurance or pay a penalty .The study 's authors cautioned that their analysis does not prove that Massachusetts 's healthcare overhaul caused the decline in deaths ; all it can show is that the two are correlated .Previous studies that examined whether expanding access to health insurance resulted in fewer deaths got mixed results .The new study compared deaths among people aged 20 to 64 years old in Massachusetts counties before and after `` Romneycare '' ( as the health insurance overhaul is known , since Republican politician Mitt Romney was governor when it became law ) to counties in other states .The years compared were 2001-2005 and 2007-2010 .For every 830 people who became insured as a result of Massachusetts ' mandatory coverage and Medicaid expansion , they calculated , one fewer person died each year .That represents `` a 3 percent decline in the death rate in the first few years after implementation , '' lead author Dr Benjamin Sommers of Harvard School of Public Health in Boston told Reuters Health .In particular , there were fewer deaths from cancer , heart disease and infections , all of which benefit from preventive and regular healthcare , said Sommers . He has served as a senior advisor to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services , the lead Obamacare agency , and continued to serve part-time in an advisory role in 2013-2014 .`` The decline in the death rate of Massachusetts was focused in those areas where you would think reform would make the biggest difference , '' he said .The drop in deaths was also larger in poorer communities that had a high number of uninsured residents before 2006 .Austin Frakt , a health economist with the Department of Veterans Affairs in Jamaica Plain , Massachusetts who was not involved in the new study but wrote an editorial accompanying it , called it `` one of the most relevant studies pertaining to the Affordable Care Act . ''Most such studies do show that health insurance has a positive effect on death rates and health , Frakt told Reuters Health : `` Those findings are out there and the findings are really robust . ''Sommers cautioned that the findings may not apply nationwide . For one thing , Massachusetts has an abundance of doctors and hospitals , many of whom accept the newly insured . Under Obamacare , people whose new insurance is not accepted by many healthcare providers might have coverage on paper but not easy access to healthcare .The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 37 million people will gain health insurance by 2018 through the Affordable Care Act .

NEW YORK — Americans with accounts on President Barack Obama 's health insurance enrollment website , HealthCare.gov , were advised that their passwords had been reset to guard against the `` Heartbleed '' bug , in a message posted on the site on Saturday .The warning marks the latest fallout from the widespread security bug , which surfaced this month and allows hackers to steal data online without a trace . Companies from Amazon.com Inc to Google Inc. have been forced to take steps to protect against Heartbleed .A message on HealthCare.gov said users who visited the website would need to create a new password to access their accounts .`` While there 's no indication that any personal information has ever been at risk , we have taken steps to address Heartbleed issues and reset consumers ' passwords out of an abundance of caution , '' said the message posted on Saturday .The Heartbleed security flaw is a `` catastrophic bug '' believed to affect two out of every three Web servers , according to the Electronic Freedom Foundation .HealthCare.gov , a health insurance exchange for the 36 states that opted out of creating their own state insurance exchanges , was created under Obama 's signature health care law , the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act .The website 's launch last fall was dogged by complaints that many users could not access the site to buy insurance or research healthcare plan options . Most of the website 's most prominent flaws were eventually remedied .Obama on Thursday announced in the White House briefing room that 8 million people had signed up by the latest enrollment deadline of April 15 . The program 's original goal was 7 million signups by the end of March , which was met .Republicans have been relentless in their criticism of the healthcare law ahead of November 's congressional elections , when the GOP hopes to reclaim control of the U.S. Senate and strengthen its majority in the House of Representatives .Critics of Obama 's health initiative have suggested HealthCare.gov might be vulnerable to security flaws .The Heartbleed bug exploits a glitch in a widely used Web encryption program known as OpenSSL .It has not affected only corporations .Canada 's tax-collection agency said this month that the private information of hundreds of people had been compromised as hackers exploited the Heartbleed bug .( Editing by Alex Dobuzinskis ; Editing by Clarence Fernandez )
NEW YORK — An unknown hacker or hackers broke into a computer server supporting the HealthCare.gov website through which consumers enroll in Obamacare health insurance , a government cybersecurity team discovered last week , apparently uploading malicious files .The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , the lead Obamacare agency , briefed key congressional staff on Thursday about the intrusions , the first of which occurred on July 8 , CMS spokesman Aaron Albright said .The malware uploaded to the server was designed to launch a distributed denial of service , or DDoS , attack against other websites , not to steal personal information , Albright said .In a DDoS , Internet-connected computers are so overwhelmed by malware attempting to communicate with their website that , unable to handle legitimate requests , they crash .`` Our review indicates that the server did not contain consumer personal information ; data was not transmitted outside the agency , and the website was not specifically targeted , '' Albright said . `` We have taken measures to further strengthen security . ''Albright said the attack would have no impact on the second open enrollment period for Obamacare , which begins on Nov. 15 .The Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services , CMS 's parent agency , and HHS leadership were notified of the attack , which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal .Representative Diane Black of Tennessee , a longtime Republican critic of Obamacare , criticized CMS for the breach , saying : `` Designing a secure website should have been a top priority for this administration . ''Republican Darrell Issa , chairman of the House of Representatives Oversight and Government Reform Committee , said the committee would seek answers from CMS Administrator Marilyn Tavenner at a hearing on Sept. 18 .A spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security , which helps investigate cyber attacks , said its Computer Emergency Readiness Team , or US-CERT , had forensically preserved the affected server and had identified and extracted the malware designed to launch a denial of service attack .US-CERT analysis indicated that only one server was involved . It was not running HealthCare.gov , but was instead used by programmers to test new code before it goes live .The test server was not supposed to be connected to the Internet , but somehow was . In addition , access to it was protected by a default password installed by the manufacturer , said Albright , who declined to say if that default was 1-2-3-4-5 or something equally breachable .Cybersecurity expert David Kennedy , chief executive of the information security firm TrustedSec LLC , said he was unconvinced this was the first successful hack on HealthCare.gov .`` There are fundamental flaws in how they 're coding the website and it 's going to take a long , long time to fix it , '' he told Reuters . `` It continues to be a really big glaring security hole . ''It is rare for hackers to upload malware without following through to use it , he added .( Reporting by Sharon Begley , Doina Chiacu and Alina Selyukh ; Editing by Dan Grebler and Peter Cooney )
NEW YORK — Hundreds of people with HIV/AIDS in Louisiana trying to obtain coverage under President Barack Obama 's healthcare reform are in danger of being thrown out of the insurance plan they selected in a dispute over federal subsidies and the interpretation of federal rules about preventing Obamacare fraud .Some healthcare advocates see discrimination in the move , but Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana says it is not trying to keep people with HIV/AIDS from enrolling in one of its policies under the Affordable Care Act , also known as Obamacare .The state 's largest carrier is rejecting checks from a federal program designed to help these patients pay for AIDS drugs and insurance premiums , and has begun notifying customers that their enrollment in its Obamacare plans will be discontinued .The carrier says it no longer will accept third-party payments , such as those under the 1990 Ryan White Act , which many people with HIV/AIDS use to pay their premiums .`` In no event will coverage be provided to any subscribers , as of March 1 , 2014 , unless the premiums are paid by the subscriber ( or a relative ) unless otherwise required by law , '' Blue Cross Blue Shield of Louisiana spokesman John Maginnis told Reuters .AIDS FUNDS EXEMPT FROM FRAUD CONCERNSThe dispute goes back to a series of statements from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) , the lead Obamacare agency .In September , CMS informed insurers that Ryan White funds `` may be used to cover the cost of private health insurance premiums , deductibles , and co-payments '' for Obamacare plans .In November , however , it warned `` hospitals , other healthcare providers , and other commercial entities '' that it has `` significant concerns '' about their supporting premium payments and helping Obamacare consumers pay deductibles and other costs , citing the risk of fraud .The insurers told healthcare advocates that the November guidance requires them to reject payments from the Ryan White program in order to combat fraud , said Robert Greenwald , managing director of the Legal Services Center of Harvard Law School , a position Louisiana Blue still maintains .`` As an anti-fraud measure , Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana has implemented a policy , across our individual health insurance market , of not accepting premium payments from any third parties who are not related '' to the subscriber , Maginnis said .On Friday , CMS spokeswoman Tasha Bradley told Reuters that , to the contrary , Ryan White grantees `` may use funds to pay for premiums on behalf of eligible enrollees in Marketplace plans , when it is cost-effective for the Ryan White program , '' meaning that having people with HIV/AIDS enroll in insurance under Obamacare could save the government money .`` The third-party payer guidance CMS released ( in November ) does not apply to '' Ryan White programs .Maginnis did not respond to further requests , sent after business hours , for comment on CMS 's Friday statement .Hundreds of indigent HIV/AIDS patients are dependent on Ryan White payments for Obamacare because they fall into a gap . They are not eligible for Medicaid , the joint federal-state health insurance program for the poor , because Louisiana did not expand the low-income program , and Obamacare federal subsidies do n't kick in until people are at 100 percent of the federal poverty level .Before Obamacare , the 1990 Ryan White Act offered people with HIV/AIDS federal financial help in paying for AIDS drugs and health insurance premiums , especially in state-run , high-risk pools .Obamacare , which bans insurers from discriminating against people with preexisting conditions , was designed to replace these high-risk pools .Starting on October 1 , AIDS advocates and others in Louisiana `` were enrolling anyone and everyone we could '' through the Obamacare exchange , said Lucy Cordts of the New Orleans NO/AIDS Task Force .Last month , her clients and those of other AIDS groups began to hear from Louisiana Blue that their enrollments were in limbo because the company would not accept the Ryan White checks for premium payments .The only other carrier that is refusing to accept such payments is Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Dakota , according to a CMS official .North Dakota Blue `` restricts premium payment from third parties including employers , providers , and state agencies , '' said spokeswoman Andrea Dinneen , but `` is currently reviewing its eligibility policies with respect to recipients of Ryan White Program funding . '''SURE LOOKS LIKE DISCRIMINATION 'Healthcare advocates are worried that the refusal to accept Ryan White payments is an effort by insurers to keep AIDS patients from enrolling in their plans and last month began pressing the issue , including with the office of Democratic Senator Mary Landrieu .In an email reviewed by Reuters , a healthcare expert on Landrieu 's staff wrote , `` BCBS LA told me their decision was not due to the CMS guidance or any confusion ( as we thought before ) but was in fact due to adverse selection concerns . I have also recently learned North Dakota 's BCBS plan has implemented the same policy . ''Jessica Stone , the Landrieu staff member , declined to elaborate on the email further or to discuss her interactions with Louisiana Blue .Adverse selection refers to the situation where an insurer attracts patients with chronic conditions and expensive care . Louisiana Blue 's action `` sure looks to us like discrimination against sick people , '' said John Peller , vice president for policy at the AIDS Foundation of Chicago .Asked if it were engaging in efforts to avoid adverse selection by refusing to accept Ryan White payments for would-be customers with HIV/AIDS , Louisiana Blue said it was not trying to keep such customers out of its plans . `` We welcome all Louisiana residents who chose Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana , '' said Maginnis .( Reporting by Sharon Begley and Julie Steenhuysen ; Editing by Peter Henderson and Prudence Crowther )
NEW YORK — More than 6.3 million Americans were deemed eligible for government healthcare plans for the poor since the October 1 launch of President Barack Obama 's healthcare law through December , federal officials reported on Wednesday .The swelling rolls for Medicaid and the Children 's Health Insurance Program ( CHIP ) reflect both an expansion of Medicaid under Obama 's Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) and what healthcare policy analysts call an `` out-of-the-woodwork effect , '' in which people who heard about Obamacare sought to obtain health insurance and discovered that they had qualified for Medicaid even before the law expanded eligibility .`` We have people who for the first time will have some health security that they never had before , '' Kathleen Sebelius , secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services , said of the Medicaid numbers at the winter meeting of the U.S. Conference of Mayors in Washington , D.C .It was not clear how much credit goes to the healthcare law , however .`` What many people do n't read far enough to learn is that this number also can include people in some states who are eligible under pre-expansion -- the woodwork effect -- and whose Medicaid enrollment was simply renewed , '' said Matt Salo , executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors .The 6.3 million people determined eligible for Medicaid or CHIP last fall swamps the 2.2 million people who had purchased private health insurance on the state-based Obamacare marketplaces that launched on October 1 . The ACA also raised the income threshold for Medicaid eligibility to 138 percent of the federal poverty level , or $ 15,856 for a single person .A Supreme Court decision in 2012 allowed each U.S. state to decide whether to accept the expansion . So far , 25 states have reached an agreement with the administration to do so . Prior to the ACA , just over 60 million Americans were covered by Medicaid .In December alone , 2.3 million individuals were determined eligible to enroll in Medicaid or CHIP , an increase of over 20 percent from November , according to the report from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ( CMS ) , the lead Obamacare agency . About 1.2 million of these were in the 25 states ( and the District of Columbia ) already expanding Medicaid , and just over 1 million were in the 25 states that have not .The CMS figures refer to the number of people that meet Medicaid eligibility rather than actual enrollment in the program due to the troubled HealthCare.gov website , which is run by the federal government to serve Obamacare sign-ups in 36 states .For months , the website did not correctly transmit information that applicants are eligible for Medicaid to their state Medicaid program . The state offices do the actual enrollment , and have been scrambling to send out tens of thousands of letters to residents to actually enroll them , the Washington Post reported this month .At the same time , the national figures mirror what many of the Medicaid-expansion states have reported . In California , for instance , 625,000 individuals have gained coverage through private policies purchased on the state 's Obamacare exchange , Covered California , while 1.2 million enrolled in Medi-Cal , the state 's Medicaid program .The websites through which people can shop for insurance under Obamacare are required to have what the Obama administration calls a `` no wrong door '' policy , meaning that even if people went to their state 's exchange expecting to buy private insurance , the site would determine if they were instead eligible for Medicaid or CHIP , which generally charge zero premiums .Several states have gone beyond that , seeking out Medicaid-eligible people by contacting those who receive food stamps or other benefits that indicate they have very low incomes .( Reporting by Sharon Begley and David Morgan ; Editing by Amanda Kwan )
NEW YORK — Now that more than 2 million people have signed up for private insurance plans created by President Barack Obama 's healthcare law , a crucial next check-up for the new marketplace will be to see how old customers are .Early data from a handful of state exchanges shows the administration needs more young adults to sign up in the next three months to help offset costs from older enrollees and prevent insurers from raising their rates .Critics of Obama 's Affordable Care Act say the market wo n't attract enough young people to keep it financially viable , putting more pressure on government funds to compensate for any insurer losses .Data from seven states and the District of Columbia , which are running their own marketplaces , show that of more than 200,000 enrollees , nearly 22 percent are 18 to 34 years old , according to a Reuters analysis .The administration had hoped that over 38 percent , or 2.7 million , of all enrollees in 2014 would be 18 to 35 years old , based on a Congressional Budget Office estimate that 7 million people would sign up by the end of March .`` The whole insurance relationship is counting on them signing up , '' said Dale Yamamoto , an independent healthcare actuarial consultant . `` Otherwise rates will have to increase . ''The picture from the initial state data is likely to change , since it mostly includes people who enrolled only through November , before a year-end surge of sign-ups for people wanting coverage effective Jan 1 . Many experts speculate the early enrollees were more likely to be in urgent need of coverage , and therefore more likely to be older or sicker .A recent survey by The Commonwealth Fund , a healthcare research foundation , found that 41 percent of those who had shopped at the various state marketplaces by the end of December were ages 19 to 34 , up from 32 percent from an October survey .One marketplace with current data , the District of Columbia , said on Friday that of the 3,646 enrollees in private plans through Thursday , about 44 percent are young adults .Healthcare experts say many young healthy people may sign up only at the end of enrollment on March 31 to avoid paying the law 's penalty for not having health insurance .A FACTOR OF PRICEThe Affordable Care Act , popularly known as Obamacare , prevents insurers from charging people more if they have a health problem . Age is one of the few factors that can affect the price , with insurers allowed to charge up to three times more for a 64-year-old than someone in their early 20s .But the healthcare costs for a 64-year-old on average are nearly five times as much as a 21-year-old , according to a study of claims from three large insurers Yamamoto conducted for the Society of Actuaries .`` The more that the marketplace is able to attract a broad mix of enrollees including the young and healthy ... the more that costs will be sustainable and premiums will be more affordable , '' said Robert Zirkelbach , spokesman for America 's Health Insurance plans , a trade group for insurers .Other factors may be as crucial , if not more , in determining the stability of the new market , including the health status of enrollees , regardless of their age , and how that lines up with what individual insurers had projected . But those details will only become clearer later in the year based on the medical claims filed by the newly insured , making age the best early proxy about whether the market is sustainable .The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , which oversees the marketplace for 36 states , has yet to provide any demographic data about enrollees . CMS is expected to release an enrollment report later this month .Data may come sooner from insurers as they discuss their recent financial performance with investors in the next few weeks . Humana Inc said on Thursday that the mix of enrollment in its marketplace plans were likely to be `` more adverse than previously expected .But healthcare experts say insurers need a better mix of enrollees than seen in the early data .`` If a quarter or more of the enrollees are young adults , I would think that 's an encouraging sign , particularly for the first half of the open enrollment period , '' said Larry Levitt , senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation healthcare think-tank .By the end of March , `` if it 's lower than that , I think there would be some cause for concern , '' Levitt said .Levitt and colleagues at Kaiser analyzed a scenario that they deemed `` worst case '' in which young adults represented 25 percent of enrollees . They found that costs then would be about 2.4 percent higher , but insurers would retain a very slim profit margin . As a result , the Kaiser authors projected the companies would raise premiums by a commensurate amount , but not enough to destabilize the market .Using the same data as Kaiser but different assumptions , Seth Chandler , a law professor at the University of Houston who specializes in insurance , said costs would be 3.5 percent higher , should only 25 percent of enrollees be young adults .`` If we see fewer than 30 percent of the enrollees being in that 18-to-34 age bracket , that 's a warning sign that there are problems , '' Chandler said . `` If the demographics come in poorly , insurers are going to lose money . ''Chandler is a skeptic of the healthcare law and writes a blog called `` ACA Death Spiral . '' Such a spiral is thought to occur if insurers facing higher costs raise premiums , so only very sick people buy coverage , leading to even higher premiums with the pattern continuing until the insurance market either disappears or shrinks to the point that it is not sustainable .The penalty for not buying insurance increases significantly by 2016 , which should bring in more young and healthy holdouts over time .Not everyone , however , is significantly concerned about the age of Obamacare enrollees this year .Linda Blumberg , senior fellow at the Urban Institute 's Health Policy Center , said that Obamacare 's protections for insurers in the first few years means the program has time to get the demographics sorted out .`` That all combines to make me much less worried about the mix for this year , '' Blumberg said . `` I do n't think we have to get a certain percentage of enrollees to be below age 35 or this thing crumbles .

NEW YORK — Some top U.S. health insurers are giving consumers more time to pay their Obamacare premiums , extending the deadline to the end of January for benefits that begin retroactively from January 1 .The new extension adds to a series of deadline delays by government and the insurance industry to compensate for technical failures and errors plaguing the enrollment process under President Barack Obama 's healthcare law .The Obama administration and insurers have been working to prevent cases where problems in setting up new policies meant a consumer who thought they had insurance would not have benefits when they needed them . Republican opponents of the law have seized on its troubled rollout as a top issue for 2014 congressional elections .Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas , Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois and three more BCBS plans that are part of the privately held Health Care Service Corp chain have moved the first payment deadline to January 30 from January 10 . All of the plans are sold through the federal website HealthCare.gov , which had a December 24 deadline for customers to enroll and be guaranteed coverage by January 1 in 36 states .Others , including Aetna Inc , said they were still considering this Friday to be the payment deadline .Technical problems prevented consumer access to HealthCare.gov in the first two months following its launch on October 1 . An emergency effort to fix the site allowed hundreds of thousands of people to use it daily by early December , and the Obama administration urged insurers to give consumers leeway to sort through any remaining errors . America 's Health Insurance Plans , a top industry trade and lobbying group , recommended a first payment deadline of January 10 .By late December , more than 2 million people nationwide had picked new private insurance plans under Obamacare , but the number included consumers who have yet to pay their first premium and therefore are not truly enrolled .Insurers say they have been communicating to customers through social media , targeted emails and telephone calls to let them know they need to pay .`` We have been receiving a significant volume of payments and continue to assist members in activating their coverage . But some signed up close to the deadline , so we are extending the payment deadline to give customers extra time to pay their first month 's premium , '' Lauren Perlstein Plungas , a spokeswoman for Health Care Service Corp , said in a statement .Independence Blue Cross Blue Shield , based in Philadelphia , is also moving its time frame to pay , until January 28 , a spokeswoman said . Independence is selling its plans for Pennsylvania on HealthCare.gov .WellPoint Inc , which operates Blue Cross Blue Shield in 14 states and is known for its Anthem and Empire brands , said that its first payment deadline is now January 15 . WellPoint is selling plans on HealthCare.gov and on some of the 14 exchanges run by states . It had previously set a January 10 deadline .The state-run Covered California exchange announced this past weekend that it was moving the payment date for insurance plans to January 15 from a previous deadline of January 6 , saying that its extension was aimed at easing the rush by consumers to pay their invoices .In Connecticut , the three insurers selling Obamacare plans have established three different deadlines for January 1 coverage : January 10 , 15 and 17 , the head of the state 's Access Health exchange Kevin Counihan said on Wednesday . In addition , the deadline for February 1 coverage is also January 15 .`` This is all just part of everyone 's scrambling to meet some of the administrative complexities of implementation and enrollment , '' Counihan said . `` Part of the challenge is that there are so many dates out there that consumers have the risk of being confused .

NEW YORK — Thanks to a final April surge , California 's Obamacare marketplace enrolled a total of 1.4 million people in private health insurance plans , state officials announced on Thursday , beating a federal forecast by just over 800,000 enrollees .The marketplace also signed up an additional 1.9 million in the state 's Medicaid program for the poor .California 's Obamacare enrollments are among 7.5 million people nationally who have signed up , according to federal officials .Peter V. Lee , executive director of Covered California , the state 's Obamacare health insurance marketplace , called that `` a huge number '' and said enrollees `` are part of history . ''The country 's first open enrollment period for coverage under President Barack Obama 's healthcare reform law ended in most states on March 31 . California and a handful of others kept their doors open longer , citing technical difficulties that kept some customers from accessing Obamacare websites . The extension paid off : on the final day , April 15 , Covered California had more than 50,000 sign-ups , a one-day record .That may have come in part because Tuesday was also the deadline for filing 2013 income tax returns . This year many tax preparers , both in-person and electronic , reminded people that the law requires them to have health insurance this year or pay a tax penalty next year .Two insurance companies dominated California 's Obamacare market . Anthem Blue Cross , part of Wellpoint , got 30 percent of the total by the end of March ( the most recent data on carriers ) , and non-profit Blue Shield took 27 percent . Health Net got 19 percent and Kaiser Permanente , 17 percent , with dozens of other carriers splitting the rest .From April 1 to 15 , 205,685 Californians enrolled in private health insurance through the Covered California exchange . . The state improved significantly on its early enrollment of Latinos , a key demographic group for Democrats who hope to turn Obamacare 's successes into votes in November 's mid-term elections . Latino enrollment reached 305,106 , 28 percent of the total , 30 percent above where it stood at the end of March .Young adults 18 to 34 years old , whose participation is considered key to keeping a check on premiums , make up 29 percent of Covered California enrollment . They are 25 percent of the state 's population .People 45 to 64 , whose medical costs are expected to be relatively high , make up 48 percent of California 's enrollees .Of those enrolled in Covered California plans , 88 percent are eligible for financial subsidies to defray the cost of monthly premiums .Insurance companies report that 85 percent of enrollees have paid their first month 's premium , Lee said on Thursday . Although critics of Obamacare have pointed to the 15 percent or more who do not pay as evidence of the law 's failures , Lee told the Reuters healthcare summit this month that many non-payments are because would-be customers gain health coverage through their jobs and no longer need their Covered California plan .( Reporting by Sharon Begley ; editing by Andrew Hay )
NEW YORK — The late-December surge that pushed enrollment in private health insurance plans under Obamacare past 2.1 million people continued into 2014 , officials of several state-run insurance marketplaces said on Wednesday .It was encouraging news for White House hopes of signing up 7 million Americans by March 31 , the deadline for 2014 coverage under President Barack Obama 's healthcare law .That goal has appeared elusive due to the disastrous performance of HealthCare.gov , the federal enrollment portal through which Americans in 36 states sign up to buy health insurance , in October and November , even as the websites of many of the 15 state-run exchanges fared better .The Washington Health Benefit Exchange has had about 8,000 enrollments in private health plans since late December , bringing the total to just over 73,000 . `` We doubled our call-center staff in December '' to handle the end-of-year surge , said Richard K. Onizuka , chief executive of the exchange , in a conference call arranged by the nonprofit healthcare advocacy group Families USA . `` And now we 're almost doubling it again . ''The deadline is Wednesday for coverage that starts on February 1 . For coverage that begins on March 1 , consumers must enroll by February 15 . Those who do not have insurance must enroll by March 31 or incur a tax penalty .Kentucky , whose Democratic Gov . Steve Beshear has been an enthusiastic supporter of Obama 's Affordable Care Act , has been logging about 2,000 simultaneous users on its website in January , said Carrie Banahan , executive director of the Kentucky Health Benefit Exchange . That compares with 600 before the December surge , when `` Kynect '' topped 33,000 enrollments in private health insurance . Banahan did not release January enrollment figures .Connecticut enrolled about 36,000 people in private health plans through late December , spokeswoman Kathleen Tallarita said . Since then it has enrolled `` in some cases , 500 to 1,000 in a week , '' which would put it behind 2013 's pace . The state will release January enrollment figures on Thursday .New York also `` is seeing an increase in call volume as we approach today 's deadline , '' said Danielle Hollihan , deputy director of New York State of Health , referring to the January 15 cut-off for coverage beginning February 1 . New York has been enrolling about 7,000 people per day in private plans and Medicaid in January , she said , compared with a total of about 230,000 from October 1 through late December .California , whose 500,000 private-plan enrollments through December lead all states , has not released January numbers , but said it continued `` to see a tremendous amount of interest . ''Data on sign-up activity for HealthCare.gov in the last two weeks was not available .Virtually every state is trying to pump up enrollment by young adults , since those aged 18 to 34 so far account for only 24 percent of enrollees nationwide , the Obama administration announced on Monday .The program needs a higher proportion of younger members , who tend to be healthier and , therefore , less likely to need the costliest medical care , to offset expenses for sicker beneficiaries .On Thursday , Covered California will hold a six-hour extravaganza at YouTube studios in Los Angeles , with a live broadcast of what it calls `` a range of viral entertainment geared toward millennials about the importance of getting covered .

NEW YORK — The morning after President Barack Obama announced his sweeping action to overhaul the U.S. immigration system , conservative groups and states were already pulling together legal strategies to dismantle the plan .Opponents said there will likely be a three-pronged legal approach to stymie Obama 's moves : Congress could sue the president for constitutional overreach , states could file lawsuits arguing the action strains local finances , or individuals could try to prove they 've been harmed by the order . Just hours after the speech , an Arizona sheriff filed suit arguing the reform is unconstitutional .`` There is going to be massive litigation all over the place because there is tremendous legal confusion about what the administration is doing and what the states ' obligations will be , '' said Dan Stein from the Federation for American Immigration Reform ( FAIR ) , which calls for restrictions on immigration .While law scholars say the president is on strong legal footing , a flurry of lawsuits will cause headaches for the Obama administration in its final two years and may stir public opinion against a policy meant to be one of his signature triumphs .Obama 's health care plan , another major political victory for the President , has also been mired in legal challenges with opponents taking suits all the way to the Supreme Court . Just on Friday , Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives filed a long-anticipated lawsuit challenging Obamacare .States are already lining up to sue over Obama 's immigration action , under which he plans to grant temporary legal status to some 4.4 million undocumented immigrants who are parents of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents .Republican governors Scott Walker of Wisconsin , Rick Perry of Texas and Pat McCrory of North Carolina have all voiced support for taking legal action without giving further details . Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt also announced his intention to sue .MODEL LAWSUITStill , making a legal case will be an uphill battle . Presidents historically have had wide discretion to actalone on immigration and under a concept known as `` prosecutorial discretion , '' can decide to not enforce every violation of federal law when resources are limited .In a 33-page legal memo , the Department of Justice said the action falls within the bounds of the constitution and that Congress has supported favorable treatment of law-abiding immigrants with deep U.S. ties .The main hurdle for any lawsuit will be proving `` standing , '' a requirement under U.S. law that for someone to be able to sue , they have to show they have been directly harmed .The hardest case to win would be one filed by Congress , legal experts say , since lawmakers would struggle to prove standing . Republicans have vowed to act in other ways and could try to pass laws to take away the President 's authority to act on immigration or slash funds for his initiatives .States might have a stronger argument if they can prove financial harm from the program .One ongoing case challenging Obama 's previous executive action in 2012 to grant deportation relief to immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children , could serve as a model .The suit was filed by a group of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers upset by White House directives . The state of Mississippi attempted to join the action .To prove standing , Mississippi argued illegal immigrantsdrained state resources and the ICE agents said they were being forced to violate their oaths to enforce the law .Even though a federal judge dismissed the case , he found the ICE agents had standing . Mississippi was dropped from the case but only because its economic analysis showing harm was outdated . The agents are appealing .Conservative groups also said U.S. workers might be able tobring a case if they can prove they were displaced by immigrants granted new work permits .`` We will be looking for people who can demonstratively prove that aliens who are getting work documents are working in similar fields , '' Stein from FAIR said .The suit filed Thursday by Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio - whose police force has been sued for racial profiling of immigrants - is short on legal reasoning and is likely to be dismissed , said Kari Hong a Boston College Law School professor .`` At this point it 's all rhetoric . It 's not based in strong legal analysis , '' Hong said .Short of legal action , states could move to withholdbenefits to recipients of the new status . But immigration advocates are likely to counter those moves with their own suits , potentially clogging the courts with more cases related to Obama 's order .After the deportation relief was announced in 2012 , Arizona , Nebraska and Michigan all blocked young recipients from obtaining drivers licenses . Immigrants sued in all three states .( Additional reporting by Lawrence Hurley in Washington and Gabriel Denedetti in Boca Raton ; Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi and Martin Howell )
NEW YORK — The only three insurance companies in Louisiana that sell healthcare policies under President Barack Obama 's healthcare law throughout the state are rejecting payments from a federal program intended to help low-income HIV patients , advocacy groups said on Thursday .The Louisiana Health Cooperative and Vantage Health Plan , two smaller insurers , made the move following a decision by the state 's largest insurer , Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana , late last year to reject the payments .Lambda Legal , a non-profit group , filed a civil rights complaint about the two smaller carriers ' action with the Obama administration on Thursday , following a similar complaint about Louisiana Blue last week .`` Additional carriers are jumping on the discrimination bandwagon , '' said Susan Sommer , director of constitutional litigation for Lambda Legal , which works to protect the civil rights of lesbians , gay men , and people with HIV . `` The worst nightmare for people with HIV-AIDS is coming true in Louisiana : they 're being turned away in what 's become a race to the bottom by insurers . ''The issue involves the federal Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program which , for 23 years , has made grants to states , cities and nonprofit organizations to help low-income people with HIV purchase health insurance .The organizations assumed the federal money could be used to pay premiums for Ryan White beneficiaries who purchased private coverage on insurance exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) , just as the funds had been used to pay premiums previously .In recent weeks , however , Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana began rejecting Ryan White payments sent on behalf of impoverished HIV-AIDS patients who had enrolled in one of its Obamacare plans , as did Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Dakota .The insurers told healthcare advocates that guidance issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , the lead Obamacare agency , prevented them from accepting third-party payments for the new health plans , even when the funds came from a government program .That guidance , issued in November , was meant to prevent self-dealing or even fraud . `` The worry was that a hospital , for instance , would sign up and pay ( Obamacare ) premiums for their uninsured patients , '' said law professor Mark Hall of Wake Forest University . If a hospital also steered patients toward an insurer that includes it in its network , the hospital would turn a charity patient into a paying one , something CMS regards as a form of prohibited self-dealing .Last week , CMS said the ban on third-party payments `` does not apply '' to those made on behalf of Obamacare enrollees by `` state and federal government programs or grantees ( such as the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program ) . ''Over the weekend , CMS went further , said it `` is considering amending the rules to require , '' and not merely allow , `` issuers to accept these ( Ryan White ) payments . ''On Thursday , Louisiana Blue nevertheless said it will stop honoring Ryan White and other third-party payments for premiums beginning March 1 . The policy , it said , is `` a safeguard against ... patient steering and other fraudulent activity , '' adding that it knows `` from experience that there are people who want to game the system . ''ADVERSE SELECTIONLouisiana Health Cooperative has said it `` will not be accepting third-party insurance premium payments either , '' said Lucy Cordts of the NO/AIDS Task Force . Her group , which advocates on behalf of people with AIDS , has an estimated 350 Louisiana residents who chose Coop plans . `` They 'll all now need to consider another company . ''Other healthcare advocates said they had informed Louisiana Health Cooperative officials that CMS allows Ryan White payments to be used for Obamacare insurance premiums , and were told that `` they would not change their policy unless required , '' said Moriba Karamoko , director of the Louisiana Healthcare Coalition .Coop spokeswoman Anisha Williams declined to comment .The third carrier selling Obamacare insurance throughout Louisiana , Vantage Health Plan , informed the state that it , too , will not accept Ryan White payments . A spokesperson for the physician-founded company did not return messages seeking comment .Insurance experts point out that once one carrier in a market institutes policies that drive away potentially high-cost customers such as people with HIV-AIDS , other carriers feel pressure to do the same for fear of being the only one to cover them , a situation called adverse selection .Last week , Lambda Legal filed an administrative complaint with the Office of Civil Rights of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services , CMS 's parent agency , against Louisiana Blue . On Thursday it filed complaints against Vantage and Louisiana Health Cooperative , arguing that their refusal to accept Ryan White payments flouted a key provision of the ACA , namely its requirement that insurers accept any customer regardless of health status .`` What we 're seeing in Louisiana is a crisis for low-income people with AIDS , '' said Lambda Legal 's Sommer . `` These are exactly the people the Affordable Care Act was designed to provide a safety net for . ''One patient who enrolled in a Louisiana Blue plan learned in December that the insurer would not accept Ryan White checks for his premiums .`` So now I am without insurance , '' said Mark , 44 , a former high-school teacher who is unemployed and asked that his last name not be published . He was able to obtain HIV medications from the NO/AIDS Task Force , through the Ryan White program . But he can not afford medications for high cholesterol and high blood pressure that are common side effects of HIV drugs .`` My health is in danger at this point , '' he said . `` If we sit back and let them do this , it goes against everything the Affordable Care Act is about .

NEW YORK — The percentage of Americans without health insurance dipped to its lowest in nearly six years due in part to U.S. President Barack Obama 's healthcare reform law , commonly known as Obamacare , according to a Gallup poll released on Monday .Some 15.6 percent of Americans lacked health insurance in the first three months of 2014 , down from a high of 18 percent in late 2013 , according to the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index survey .`` 'Obamacare ' appears to be accomplishing its goal of increasing the percentage of Americans with health insurance coverage , '' the report said .Black and low-income Americans saw some of the most pronounced drops in the uninsured rate , with declines of more than 3 percentage points .Hispanics remained the group most likely not to be insured , with more than one in three individuals lacking coverage , though the level dropped nearly 2 points in the first quarter , according to the poll of 43,500 adult Americans between January and March . It has a margin of error of 1 percentage point .The percentage of Americans without health insurance has generally trended upward over the past six years . Gallup began tracking insurance coverage in 2008 , starting at a low of 14.5 percent and increasing every subsequent year except for 2012 .Obamacare 's individual mandate , which requires most Americans to obtain coverage or face a fine , went into effect in January and the law 's first enrollment period ended March 31 . The government granted a deadline extension into April for those who faced technical difficulties while signing up .The White House last week reported a total of 7.1 million private insurance enrollments through the Affordable Care Act 's health insurance exchanges , exceeding most expectations , despite a troubled rollout in October 2013 .An additional 3 million signed up for Medicaid , government-provided health insurance for low-income people , the administration said Friday , bringing the total number of sign-ups to over 10 million .Republicans have consistently campaigned against the law , making at least 50 attempts to repeal it since it was signed in 2010 . Opposition to Obamacare also figures prominently in many 2014 midterm Congressional campaigns .The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has not yet released its April enrollment report , Gallup researchers said , but the survey 's findings matched the government 's last figures .( Editing by Scott Malone and Bernadette Baum )
NEW YORK — Three Louisiana insurers agreed on Monday to continue to accept payments from a federal program for low-income people with HIV/AIDS to cover their Obamacare insurance premiums , the carriers said during a hearing in U.S. District Court .Earlier this year BlueCross BlueShield of Louisiana , the state 's largest carrier , said it would begin rejecting checks from a federal program called the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program that for decades had helped low-income people with HIV and AIDS pay for both AIDS drugs and insurance premiums .Louisiana Health Cooperative and Vantage Health Plan , the two other insurers selling Obamacare policies throughout the state , said they would be forced to follow the same strategy .Louisiana Blue said its policy against third-party payments was designed to prevent fraud . The chief federal agency administering President Barack Obama 's Affordable Care Act , however , said it strongly encouraged carriers to accept the Ryan White payments and did not see any potential for fraud .That led critics to charge the insurer with adopting a policy designed to keep high-medical-cost HIV/AIDS patients off its rolls , something Louisiana Blue denied .In response to the company 's decision not to accept Ryan White payments for Obamacare premiums after this month , Lambda Legal , a civil rights group that works on behalf of gay men and lesbians , filed a lawsuit against it , asking that Louisiana Blue be forced to accept the payments .At a hearing on Monday , the company said it would accept the Ryan White payments for premiums on behalf of lower-income Louisianans living with HIV through November 15 , 2014 , when the next open enrollment period begins .`` This will maintain critical health care coverage '' for such customers , '' Scott Schoettes of Lambda Legal said in a statement . `` There was a Sword of Damocles hanging over our client and other Louisianans , with these insurers having previously indicated that in just three weeks they would stop accepting the federal Ryan White Program insurance premium subsidies . ''Although the three Louisiana insurers got national attention for their refusal to accept Ryan White payments for new HIV/AIDS customers who signed up for coverage via HealthCare.gov , the federal Obamacare portal , in fact Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Dakota has the same policy , said spokeswoman Andrea Dinneen .`` We have never accepted third-party payments for ACA products or any of our products , '' she told Reuters . `` Because we 've always had this policy , we did not accept payments from RWHAP pre-ACA '' either .The Louisiana case is East v.

NEW YORK — U.S. doctors and teaching hospitals received $ 3.5 billion from pharmaceutical companies and medical device makers in the last five months of 2013 , according to the most extensive data trove on such payments ever made public .The payments , disclosed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) on Tuesday , include consulting and speaking fees , travel , meals , entertainment and research grants . The names of the recipients of about 40 percent of the payments reported by companies were withheld because CMS had concerns about data inconsistencies .Some 546,000 individual providers including physicians , dentists and osteopaths and 1,360 teaching hospitals received 4.4 million separate payments from healthcare companies .The companies were required by President Barack Obama 's 2010 healthcare reform law to disclose to CMS by March all payments of $ 10 or more made from August to December 2013 . Even payments that physicians requested be sent to a charity were required to be reported .The American Medical Association ( AMA ) and other physician groups had asked CMS to delay the release of the data by six months , saying that errors could create a false impression about the influence of industry on individual doctors .The extent of the industry payments , which came to $ 23 million a day , was in line with years of research .

NEW YORK — U.S. healthcare companies are winning higher profit forecasts , bucking a wider trend on Wall Street , as pricey new biotech drugs hit the market and insurance enrollment rises under the Affordable Care Act .Analysts ' profit expectations for the group have risen sharply since the start of the year , while estimates for most of the other nine Standard & Poor 's 500 macro sectors have fallen , according to Thomson Reuters data .The jump in forecasts has come in the past two months , thanks largely to rising estimates for biotechnology companies such as Gilead , and for insurers , including Aetna .It provides some early evidence that President Barack Obama 's signature healthcare overhaul could be a long-term source of profit growth for managed care providers .`` Now you 're actually seeing real numbers grow and that population start to take off , '' said Betsy Pecor , portfolio manager at Eagle Asset Management , based in St. Petersburg , Florida . Companies `` are actually seeing that growth . ''About 8 million people have signed up for the plans , which are provided by commercial subscribers and come with income-based government subsidies , above the 2 million who had enrolled by January .Aetna and other insurers have said they lost money on the plans this year , but insurers are heading into new markets for 2015 to add customers .Many healthcare companies are better able to manage Obamacare now than they were last year , Pecor said .EXCEEDS FORECASTSProfit estimates for healthcare companies for 2014 have jumped from up 8.3 percent at the start of January to up 12.2 percent now , one of just a few sectors with a 2014 earnings outlook that exceeds profit-growth forecasts at the start of the year , Thomson Reuters data showed .Earnings growth estimates for the whole S & P 500 this year have gone down slightly in that period , from 10.8 percent in January to 9.1 percent now .The upward revision is also the most of any sector except utilities , where estimates reflect a blow-out first quarter courtesy of home heating needs during the cold winter in North America . By contrast , the revisions to the health sector earnings reflect rising expectations for the second quarter and beyond .The question for investors is whether the improving outlook is already reflected in stock prices .The healthcare sector jumped 39 percent in 2013 , more than any other sector except consumer discretionaries . Healthcare is up 10.2 percent so far for 2014 , outpacing the 6 percent rise for the wider S & P 500 , but its advance has shown signs of slowing in the last month or so .`` You have more people using healthcare at these higher rates , and that 's going to get you earnings , but my question is for how long , '' said Kim Forrest , senior equity research analyst , Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh . `` It 's really unclear at this point how much money this is and how long it can be sustained . ''To be sure , valuations for the healthcare sector are relatively high . The price-to-earnings multiple for the sector is at 16.9 , down from 17.3 at the start of the year . That compares with the S & P 500 's earnings multiple of 16.0 , which is up from about 15.1 at the start of 2014 , Thomson Reuters data showed .There may still be pockets of value , especially in the health industry groups that have seen the greatest growth in earnings forecasts : biotech and insurance . Biotech 's P/E ratio is 16.8 compared with 24.5 at the start of the year , while the average P/E ratio for the five managed care companies in the S & P 500 is 13.6 , up from 12.4 at the beginning of 2014 .Phil Orlando , chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors in New York , said his firm rotated money out of the high-growth biotech names and into less volatile names in the healthcare sector in March , but he still likes biotech .`` There will come a point in the cycle , maybe later this year , that we put some money back into these biotechnology names . ''PRICING POWERBiotechnology companies , which were top victims in the sell-off of so-called momentum stocks earlier this year , are the biggest contributors to the gain .Biotechs are benefiting from pricing power , as more of their blockbuster drugs come on the market , analysts said . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved 27 drugs last year and 39 in 2012 , the most of any year except 1996 .`` They 're all in the midst of launching or have launched new products that are head and shoulders above the existing products out there , and they 're getting the pricing and the demand , '' said David Heupel , senior healthcare analyst at Thrivent Investment Management , in Minneapolis .In the past 90 days , 25 analysts raised their profit expectations for the full year on Gilead , the maker of the market-leading hepatitis C treatment , Sovaldi , with a mean change of 65 percent higher .

NEW YORK — U.S. healthcare companies are winning higher profit forecasts , bucking a wider trend on Wall Street , as pricey new biotech drugs hit the market and insurance enrollment rises under the Affordable Care Act .Analysts ' profit expectations for the group have risen sharply since the start of the year , while estimates for most of the other nine Standard & Poor 's 500 macro sectors have fallen , according to Thomson Reuters data .The jump in forecasts has come in the past two months , thanks largely to rising estimates for biotechnology companies such as Gilead , and for insurers , including Aetna .It provides some early evidence that President Barack Obama 's signature healthcare overhaul could be a long-term source of profit growth for managed care providers .`` Now you 're actually seeing real numbers grow and that population start to take off , '' said Betsy Pecor , portfolio manager at Eagle Asset Management , based in St. Petersburg , Florida . Companies `` are actually seeing that growth . ''About 8 million people have signed up for the plans , which are provided by commercial subscribers and come with income-based government subsidies , above the 2 million who had enrolled by January .Aetna and other insurers have said they lost money on the plans this year , but insurers are heading into new markets for 2015 to add customers .Many healthcare companies are better able to manage Obamacare now than they were last year , Pecor said .EXCEEDS FORECASTSProfit estimates for healthcare companies for 2014 have jumped from up 8.3 percent at the start of January to up 12.2 percent now , one of just a few sectors with a 2014 earnings outlook that exceeds profit-growth forecasts at the start of the year , Thomson Reuters data showed .Earnings growth estimates for the whole S & P 500 this year have gone down slightly in that period , from 10.8 percent in January to 9.1 percent now .The upward revision is also the most of any sector except utilities , where estimates reflect a blow-out first quarter courtesy of home heating needs during the cold winter in North America . By contrast , the revisions to the health sector earnings reflect rising expectations for the second quarter and beyond .The question for investors is whether the improving outlook is already reflected in stock prices .The healthcare sector jumped 39 percent in 2013 , more than any other sector except consumer discretionaries . Healthcare is up 10.2 percent so far for 2014 , outpacing the 6 percent rise for the wider S & P 500 , but its advance has shown signs of slowing in the last month or so .`` You have more people using healthcare at these higher rates , and that 's going to get you earnings , but my question is for how long , '' said Kim Forrest , senior equity research analyst , Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh . `` It 's really unclear at this point how much money this is and how long it can be sustained . ''To be sure , valuations for the healthcare sector are relatively high . The price-to-earnings multiple for the sector is at 16.9 , down from 17.3 at the start of the year . That compares with the S & P 500 's earnings multiple of 16.0 , which is up from about 15.1 at the start of 2014 , Thomson Reuters data showed .There may still be pockets of value , especially in the health industry groups that have seen the greatest growth in earnings forecasts : biotech and insurance . Biotech 's P/E ratio is 16.8 compared with 24.5 at the start of the year , while the average P/E ratio for the five managed care companies in the S & P 500 is 13.6 , up from 12.4 at the beginning of 2014 .Phil Orlando , chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors in New York , said his firm rotated money out of the high-growth biotech names and into less volatile names in the healthcare sector in March , but he still likes biotech .`` There will come a point in the cycle , maybe later this year , that we put some money back into these biotechnology names . ''PRICING POWERBiotechnology companies , which were top victims in the sell-off of so-called momentum stocks earlier this year , are the biggest contributors to the gain .Biotechs are benefiting from pricing power , as more of their blockbuster drugs come on the market , analysts said . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved 39 drugs last year , the most of any year except 1996 .`` They 're all in the midst of launching or have launched new products that are head and shoulders above the existing products out there , and they 're getting the pricing and the demand , '' said David Heupel , senior healthcare analyst at Thrivent Investment Management , in Minneapolis .In the past 90 days , 25 analysts raised their profit expectations for the full year on Gilead , the maker of the market-leading hepatitis C treatment , Sovaldi , with a mean change of 65 percent higher . None revised expectations lower , Thomson Reuters StarMine data showed .Sovaldi 's $ 84,000 price tag for a 12-week treatment is so high , however , that it has come under fire from insurers , who are pushing Gilead 's rivals to offer lower prices when their hepatitis C medicines go on the market .For Alexion Pharmaceuticals , 18 analysts raised their profit estimates in the past 90 days , with a mean change of 9.8 percent higher , while none revised them lower .Among insurers , 12 analysts raised their profit expectations over the past 90 days for Aetna 's earnings , with a mean change of 2.2 percent higher , and just one revised them lower .

NEW YORK — U.S. judges have their work cut out for them untangling a legal knot created on Tuesday when two federal appeals courts released conflicting rulings hours apart going to the heart of the role the federal government will play in Obamacare .The latest conservative challenge to President Barack Obama 's healthcare overhaul will not necessarily land in the U.S. Supreme Court , although it could end up there as soon as this year if the two lower courts go on disagreeing .At stake is how millions of Americans pay for private health insurance , or if they can afford it at all .The 2010 Affordable Care Act authorized tax credits to subsidize private health insurance . Seeking to upend the law as it was going into effect , businesses and individuals filed lawsuits asking that the subsidies be declared unlawful except in states that established their own online insurance marketplaces .Analysts estimate that as many as five million people could be affected if subsidies disappear from the federally created marketplaces . The federal government set up insurance marketplaces in 36 states that did not themselves establish exchanges .Tuesday 's conflicting rulings created what lawyers call a circuit split .A three-judge panel in Washington , D.C. , voted 2-1 to invalidate subsidies in the 36 states . Hours later , a three-judge panel in Richmond , Virginia , unanimously ruled the opposite , upholding the subsidies nationwide .The courts divided on the meaning behind the law 's words . The law says subsidies may be given `` through an exchange established by the state , '' a phrase that conservative lawyers argue excludes the federal marketplace . The Obama administration counters that the exchanges were meant to be uniform .Both cases had been pending for months , and both courts are on an equal level in the U.S. judicial system , just below the Supreme Court .Their divide might not last , though . Some lawyers following the litigation said they expected the full U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to vote to rehear the case and reverse its panel .DEMOCRATIC APPOINTEESSince taking office in 2009 , Obama has used his appointment power to reshape the D.C . Circuit and the Richmond-based 4th Circuit . Judges appointed by Democratic presidents were a minority on both courts , but they now have majorities .`` If the D.C . Circuit does away with the panel ruling that we saw from that court this morning , then every court will have ruled in favor of the government , '' Elizabeth Wydra , chief counsel of the Constitutional Accountability Center , a liberal legal group , told reporters on a conference call .The suits were brought by a mix of individuals and businesses from Texas , Kansas , Missouri , Tennessee , West Virginia and Virginia .In the Richmond case , the plaintiffs could ask for a rehearing before the full 4th Circuit , despite its Democratic-appointee majority , or they could petition directly to the Supreme Court .The latter option would put the question quickly before the closely divided high court , where in 2012 conservative Chief Justice John Roberts joined the four most liberal justices to turn aside a challenge to Obamacare . The court has no obligation to hear the case .`` We just have n't made a decision yet on what we will be doing , '' said Sam Kazman , general counsel for the Competitive Enterprise Institute , a conservative group that helped to organize the suits .Two lawsuits challenging the tax credits are pending in federal courts in Indiana and Oklahoma . They are at an earlier stage than the ones in Virginia and Washington , D.C .Nicholas Bagley , a University of Michigan law professor , said that it was difficult to predict what judges would do but that a reversal of Tuesday 's D.C . Circuit ruling appeared likely .After that , `` it 's just too early to know what the Supreme Court in that context would choose to do , '' Bagley said on a conference call organized by the Federalist Society , a conservative legal group .( Additional reporting by Aruna Viswanatha ; Editing by Howard Goller )
NEW YORK — U.S. medical providers are seeing only a trickle of patients newly insured under President Barack Obama 's healthcare law , as insurers , hospitals and doctors try to work out any hitches in coverage .More than 2 million people have signed up for new private health plans that took effect on Wednesday under the Affordable Care Act , popularly known as Obamacare . While some of those consumers were already lining up doctor visits last month , early reports from providers and an online medical booking service show the demand for care has been modest so far .Within the Obama administration , officials fear a surge of patients in the coming weeks could spotlight cases where consumers who signed up for insurance ca n't immediately get care due to technical failures on the government 's HealthCare.gov enrollment website .Already on Friday , Senate Republicans opposed to the law seized on scattered media reports of a handful of people having difficulty confirming their new insurance policies , feeding into a narrative of Obamacare 's harms that is expected to intensify ahead of Congressional elections in November .Central Ohio Primary Care , a 250-physician practice , is holding off on filing claims for patients who say they bought plans through the HealthCare.gov exchange , said Chief Executive Officer Dr. William Wulf .The delay will allow insurers more time to confirm membership information and avert any erroneous claim denials , Wulf said .Such a grace period `` surely is not desirable long term , '' he said , but the number of patients with Obamacare plans has so far been low and represents only a small fraction of the practice 's patients .`` What we 're doing is we 're seeing the patients , trusting they are in fact going to pay for insurance and just not sending a bill yet , '' Wulf said .Contrary to fears that Obamacare enrollees would be sicker than other Americans , with serious and expensive pent-up medical needs , so far they are not much different from other Americans , according to data from ZocDoc , a six-year-old closely held company that allows patients to find a doctor who accepts their insurance and make an appointment online .Obamacare consumers `` started booking appointments the last two weeks of December for January appointments , '' said ZocDoc founder and Chief Operating Officer Dr. Oliver Kharraz . `` The vast majority of these were for preventive care , not acute care where people indicated they had an existing illness , which accounted for only 7 percent of searches . ''That mirrors the behavior of ZocDoc 's previously insured users . ZocDoc says the site gets just over 5 million unique visitors each month who are searching doctors ' ratings and reviews as well as making appointments .As many as 7 million people are expected to sign up for the new health plans , which include government subsidies for lower-income households , by the time 2014 enrollment ends on March 31 .PENT-UP DEMANDOf course , some newly insured people were anxious to get care almost as soon as the last strains of Auld Lang Syne petered out .One customer of North Shore-LIJ CareConnect , a new insurer selling plans on the New York State of Health marketplace , went to its customer center last month , paid cash for a policy , `` and asked if he could now schedule his son 's gastric bypass , '' said Chief Executive Officer Alan Murray .In the case of another CareConnect customer , last month her doctor arranged for her to have surgery for recently diagnosed endometrial cancer as soon as possible . The insurer approved it in December , before her coverage even kicked in , the surgery was successfully performed on January 2 , and the woman was discharged from the hospital on Friday .Insurers also heard from unusually high numbers of new customers anxious to confirm their coverage .On January 1 , Philadelphia-based Independence Blue Cross received eight times as many calls as a typical New Year 's Day from consumers most commonly seeking to confirm that they were indeed covered , said Brian Lobley , senior vice president of marketing and consumer business .`` We have n't seen any systemic issues '' of Independence 's newest members having trouble confirming their policies , he said .Because medical practices often do not file insurance claims daily , he added , it is too early to draw any conclusions about use of medical services with the new plans .On ZocDoc , people with Obamacare insurance searched most frequently for primary care physicians , accounting for more than half of all searches , said Kharraz , followed by obstetricians/gynecologists and dermatologists . That is identical to the most-searched-for categories for people with non-Obamacare coverage , he said .Hospitals expect Obamacare to bring them more paying patients and reduce the amount of uncompensated care they provide , but have not seen a surge yet .`` We continue to expect an uptick in volume , but we do n't think it 's anything beyond what most hospitals are prepared to handle , '' said Jeff Goldman , vice president of coverage policy for the American Hospital AssociationPharmacists are not reporting a surge in demand either . `` At this time , activity is fairly typical of what we experience each year when insurance changes take effect , '' said Walgreen Co spokeswoman Markeisha Marshall . `` Nonetheless , we anticipate a surge of activity next week .

NEW YORK — U.S. stocks closed little changed on Friday , pressured by renewed uncertainty in healthcare stocks and by Disney shares , even as October payrolls data pointed to a resilient economy in the face of sluggish global growth .The S & P 500 and Dow industrials closed at record highs and rose for a third consecutive week .Health insurers fell sharply after the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear a challenge to a key part of the Obamacare health law that , if successful , would limit the availability of federal health insurance subsidies for millions of Americans .`` Any kind of change in how the healthcare law is interpreted is going to affect healthcare stocks , probably insurers first , '' said Kim Forrest , senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh .`` Whenever the rules have potential to change everybody gets nervous . ''UnitedHealth Group fell 2.7 percent to $ 93.61 , ranking as the largest weight on the Dow industrials . Hospital operator Tenet Healthcare fell 6.5 percent to $ 47.85 while managed care facilities operator Humana Inc was down 6.6 percent to $ 130.58 .Healthcare stocks had been pressured from the opening bell by Salix Pharmaceuticals , which closed down 34 percent at $ 91.47 in its biggest-ever daily drop .Salix on Thursday slashed its full-year forecast given swollen drug inventories , an issue that dissuaded Allergan from acquiring the drugmaker , people familiar with the matter said .On the flip side , employers added 214,000 jobs last month , below the 231,000 expected in a Reuters poll of economists , while gains in the previous two months were revised higher . The unemployment rate fell to 5.8 percent , the lowest since July 2008 , even as more people entered the labor force .`` With data like this the Federal Reserve does n't feel compelled to come in and help , or squash a too-hot economy , '' said Fort Pitt Capital 's Forrest . `` No more Fed ( asset ) buying but also no rate hikes quite yet . ''Walt Disney Co fell 2.2 percent to $ 90 a day after earnings met expectations . The stock had closed Thursday at $ 92 , a record high .First Solar sank 10.8 percent to $ 50.29 as the biggest decliner on the S & P 500 a day after the company said it would not spin off its solar power plants into a separate , publicly traded entity as some of its competitors have done .Energy shares on the S & P 500 were the day 's strongest performers , rising 1 percent . The sector is down 1.4 percent so far this year .The Dow Jones industrial average rose 19.46 points , or 0.11 percent , to 17,573.93 , the S & P 500 gained 0.71 points , or 0.03 percent , to 2,031.92 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 5.94 points , or 0.13 percent , to 4,632.53 .For the week , the Dow rose 1.1 percent and the S & P added 0.7 percent in their third straight weekly gain . The Nasdaq closed the week up 0.04 percent .Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 1,869 to 1,188 , for a 1.57-to-1 ratio on the upside ; on the Nasdaq , 1,370 issues fell and 1,321 advanced for a 1.04-to-1 ratio favoring decliners .The benchmark S & P 500 index posted 52 new 52-week highs and one new low ; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 101 new highs and 58 new lows .Volume on U.S. exchanges totaled about 6.5 billion shares , compared to the 7.24 billion average in the last five sessions .( Editing by Bernadette Baum and James Dalgleish )
Nearly a week has gone by since the Supreme Court’s unexpected decision to enlist in the latest effort to destroy the Affordable Care Act , and the shock remains unabated . “This is Bush v. Gore all over again , ” one friend said as we struggled to absorb the news last Friday afternoon . “No , ” I replied . “It’s worse.”What I meant was this : In the inconclusive aftermath of the 2000 presidential election , a growing sense of urgency , even crisis , gave rise to a plausible argument that someone had better do something soon to find out who would be the next president . True , a federal statute on the books defined the “someone” as Congress , but the Bush forces got to the Supreme Court first with a case that fell within the court’s jurisdiction . The 5-to-4 decision to stop the Florida recount had the effect of calling the election for the governor of Texas , George W. Bush . I disagreed with the decision and considered the contorted way the majority deployed the Constitution’s equal-protection guarantee to be ludicrous . But in the years since , I’ve often felt like the last progressive willing to defend the court for getting involved when it did .That’s not the case here . There was no urgency . There was no crisis of governance , not even a potential one . There is , rather , a politically manufactured argument over how to interpret several sections of the Affordable Care Act that admittedly fit awkwardly together in defining how the tax credits are supposed to work for people who buy their health insurance on the exchanges set up under the law .Further , the case the court agreed to decide , King v. Burwell , doesn’t fit the normal criterion for Supreme Court review . There is no conflict among the federal appellate circuits . ( Remember that just a month ago , the absence of a circuit conflict led the justices to decline to hear seven same-sex marriage cases ? ) In the King case , a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit , in Richmond , Va. , unanimously upheld the government’s position that the tax subsidy is available to those who buy insurance on the federally run exchanges that are now in operation in 36 states .A panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled 2-to-1 the other way , accepting the plaintiffs’ argument that the language of the statute limits the tax subsidies to those who buy insurance through the state exchanges , which only 14 states have chosen to set up . The full appeals court quickly vacated the panel’s judgment and agreed to rehear the case . The new argument was set for next month , and the briefs were already filed . The absence of a circuit conflict and an imminent rehearing by the country’s most important court of appeals would , in the past , have led the Supreme Court to refrain from getting involved .So no , this isn’t Bush v. Gore . This is a naked power grab by conservative justices who two years ago just missed killing the Affordable Care Act in its cradle , before it fully took effect . When the court agreed to hear the first case , there actually was a conflict in the circuits on the constitutionality of the individual insurance mandate . So the Supreme Court’s grant of review was not only unexceptional but necessary : a neutral act . The popular belief then that the court’s intervention indicated hostility to the law was , at the least , premature .Not so this time . There is simply no way to describe what the court did last Friday as a neutral act . Now that the justices have blown their own cover , I notice the hint of a slightly defensive tone creeping into the commentary of some of those who have been cheering the prospect of rendering the Affordable Care Act unworkable : that as a statutory case , without major constitutional implications , any problems for ordinary Americans that result from a ruling against the government can be fixed by Congress ( where House Republicans have voted 50 times to repeal the entire law ) or by the states themselves ( 36 of which failed to set up their own exchanges , thus requiring the federal government to step in as provided by the law ) .Sure .It bears repeating that what’s at stake is whether the Affordable Care Act can continue on its successful trajectory or whether it will collapse into the “death spiral” it was structured to avoid . The reason goes back to the individual mandate , the constitutionality of which the Supreme Court upheld by a 5-to-4 vote two years ago . The policy reason for requiring everyone to carry health insurance is to guarantee a big pool of basically healthy people and to prevent what might otherwise be the smart strategic behavior of buying insurance only when illness strikes ( behavior the law’s “guarantee issue” provision would otherwise invite , since no one can be turned down on the basis of a pre-existing condition . )The law is also designed to make insurance affordable , with no one being required to spend more than 8 percent of his or her income of health insurance .Federal income tax subsidies available on the exchanges are supposed to bring premium costs below that threshold ; without the credits , many people would be exempt from the individual mandate and the law would fail .Congress assumed that most states would set up exchanges ; most states , led by red-state governors , did not . Section 1321 of the law provides that when a state defaults , the secretary of health and human services shall “establish and operate such Exchange within the State.” Clear enough : “such Exchange” implies , without explicitly saying so , that the federal exchange stands in for the missing state’s exchange and assumes its functions . But another section , 1401 , explicitly makes the tax subsidies available to taxpayers and their dependents who buy insurance “through an Exchange established by the State.” Those challenging the law say this means “only the state” and that the I.R.S . is not authorized to give subsidies to the more than five million people enrolled through federally run exchanges .These two provisions , part of a 900-page statute that was cobbled together without going through the usual House-Senate conference committee in which it might have been cleaned up , are the source of the confusion . The answer to the problem , as the Fourth Circuit panel found unanimously in the King case , is obvious . It’s a basic principle of administrative law that when a federal statute is ambiguous , courts defer to the agency’s interpretation — here , the I.R.S . regulation that makes the tax credits available without regard to whether the exchange is state or federal .The 1984 decision that established this deference principle , Chevron U.S.A. v. Natural Resources Defense Council , Inc. , is so central to the modern understanding of how the government works that it is among the most often invoked Supreme Court decisions of all time , cited in some 13,000 judicial decisions so far , a number that grows at the rate of about 1,000 a year . The tax provisions of the Affordable Care Act fall so naturally onto the “Chevron deference” landscape that it would take an agenda-driven act of judicial will to keep them out and to conclude that Congress enacted a law that contained the seeds of its own destruction .Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. knows something about taxes . He saved the Affordable Care Act from his usual allies two years ago by his opinion deeming the individual mandate’s penalty provision to fall within Congress’s tax power . This case puts him back under what I can only assume is an unwelcome spotlight .It takes the votes of four of the nine justices to accept a case . Certainly Justices Anthony M. Kennedy , Antonin Scalia , Clarence Thomas , and Samuel A. Alito Jr. — the four who two years ago would have invalidated not only the individual mandate but the entire law — voted to hear King v. Burwell . ( Michael A. Carvin , the plaintiffs’ lawyer , predicted as much last month , declaring in an uninhibited interview that the pending rehearing before an appeals court that has recently attained a majority of Democratic-appointed judges would be no deterrent to the justices who wanted to take the case . “I don’t know that four justices , who are needed here , are going to give much of a damn about what a bunch of Obama appointees on the D.C . Circuit think , ” he told a reporter from Talking Points Memo . )An intriguing question is whether there was a fifth vote as well , from the chief justice . I have no idea , although I can’t imagine why he would think that taking this case was either in the court’s interest or in his own ; just two months ago , at a public appearance at the University of Nebraska , he expressed concern that the “partisan rancor” of Washington could spill over onto the court .Here’s another possible scenario , just a theory : that the four , still steaming over what the right wing regards as the chief justice’s betrayal two years ago , voted to hear King v. Burwell not only for its destructive potential , but precisely to put the heat on John Roberts . I hadn’t really focused on this idea until I read a piece that John Yoo posted on National Review Online the day after the court granted the case . Professor Yoo , formerly of the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel and now at the University of California at Berkeley , wrote that the new case gave the chief justice “the chance to atone for his error in upholding Obamacare” and that “it will be the mission of his chief justiceship to repair the damage.” John Yoo — yes , the Bush administration lawyer whose “torture memos” attempted to justify that administration’s “enhanced interrogation” policies — is a smart man , a former law clerk to Justice Thomas who remains well connected at the court . His choice of the words `` atone” and “mission , ” with their religious resonance addressed to the devoutly Catholic chief justice , is no accident .So this case is rich in almost every possible dimension . Its arrival on the Supreme Court’s docket is also profoundly depressing . In decades of court-watching , I have struggled — sometimes it has seemed against all odds — to maintain the belief that the Supreme Court really is a court and not just a collection of politicians in robes . This past week , I’ve found myself struggling against the impulse to say two words : I surrender .
Nested within the news about falling deficits is news about slowing health care cost inflation , which seems to be outlasting the recession and which is driving the long-term projections for Medicare spending downward . Since one of the big questions in the Great Obamacare Debate was whether the new health care law would accelerate cost growth ( as expanded subsidies and regulations often tend to do ) or reduce it ( thanks to the various cost-containing experiments and pilot programs embedded within the bill ) , the news that costs are falling in advance of the bill’s implementation has some liberals crowing . Jonathan Chait , in particular , has taken to explaining why “the growing mass of evidence that the health-care-cost inflation problem is indeed solvable” cuts the legs out from under the entire right-of-center take on health care , deficits and entitlements , and puts the data squarely on the side of health care reform’s proponents . Here’s his elaboration on this theme:The Affordable Care Act … created a wide slew of reforms intended to attack health-care inflation from every possible angle . The law created bundled payments , so that Medicare would pay hospitals or groups of doctors based on quality , not quantity , of care . It penalized hospitals that have to readmit patients owing to shoddy work ( they previously would enjoy a second payday for doing so ) , taxed high-cost health-insurance plans , encouraged electronic medical records and research on effective treatments , and many other things . Nobody believed every one of these experiments would work perfectly . The idea was to try as many promising reforms as possible , and health-care wonks expressed cautious optimism that the law contained a wide breadth of them .Over the last few years , health-care inflation has indeed decelerated — far more deeply than even the most optimistic backers of the law dare hoped …At first , the sharp slowdown in health-care costs was assumed to have happened because the recession is making people cut back on their medical care … But as the trend has persisted , and undergone deeper study , a consensus is emerging that this is not the case at all . Several studies have found that the recession does not account for all , and possibly not even most , of the slowdown .The trend precedes Obamacare , too . But the law can’t be cleanly separated from the broad sentiment that the medical industry needed to overhaul its practices . As Matthew Yglesias argues , “If forward-looking investors think that future increases in health care spending will be met with legislative efforts to curb health care spending , then investments that rely on future high levels of health care spending won’t be made and the system will lack the capacity to deliver ever-growing levels of services.” In keeping with Yglesias’s premise , construction on hospitals cratered since 2009 and has not recovered .Even with the data on their side , none of the advocates of Obamacare is nearly as certain the law will succeed as conservatives … are that it will fail . That is a testament only to the overweening ideological certainty that pervades the right .But the mere fact that health care costs are slowing doesn’t mean that “the data” is on liberals’ side , because nobody on the right argued that the health inflation problem wasn’t “solvable.” Rather , conservatives argued that the best way to solve the problem was to change the way we provide insurance , so that ordinary health care consumption isn’t so heavily subsidized , and market forces have more room to work . Hence the right’s support for catastrophic coverage , health savings accounts , premium support for Medicare , etc . And the conservative fear was that by subsidizing comprehensive insurance plans and further regulating the insurance market , the new health care law would push the health care system in precisely the opposite direction — swamping , in the process , any beneficial impact from the bill’s various cost-control measures . The problem with Obamacare , in other words , was that while it promised to attack health-care inflation from as many angles as possible , it actually made it much harder to attack from the angle that right-of-center wonks considered most likely to work .Now does the recent drop in health care inflation vitiate this argument ? Well , not on the evidence of the studies that Chait invokes , and which my colleague Annie Lowrey recently wrote up . These studies tend to agree that the recession played a big-but-not-exclusive role in the recent slowdown in cost growth , while disagreeing on how much of this slowdown it explains ( one study says 77 percent , another 37 percent ) . They also cite the slow shift away from fee-for-service medicine that the health care law is designed to encourage ( which is a point in favor of the pro-Obamacare argument , obviously ) , the slowing pace of medical innovation ( which is good news for budgets but not for actual human beings ) , and finally — well , I’ll just quote Lowrey:Among other factors , the studies found that rising out-of-pocket payments had played a major role in the decline . The proportion of workers with employer-sponsored health insurance enrolled in a plan that required a deductible climbed to about three-quarters in 2012 from about half in 2006 , the Kaiser Family Foundation has found . Moreover , those deductibles — the amount a person needs to pay before insurance steps in to cover claims — have risen sharply . That exposes workers to a larger share of their own health costs , and generally forces them to spend less .In other words , health care costs are growing more slowly than many conservatives feared they would in part because … conservatives’ preferred policy prescriptions are being taken up in the private sector , and having an effect ! This trend may be a case against the apocalyptic right-wing deficit panic that produced the debt ceiling debacle ; there I tend to agree with Chait . But in policy terms , it seems like it makes a better case for the Paul Ryan-Ron Wyden premium support proposal for Medicare and the potential right-0f-center alternatives to Obamacare than it does for Obamacare itself .Not a dispositive case , obviously : There are many forces at work here , and since evidence also shows positive results for some of the cost control measures that the health care law tries to promote , I understand why Chait prefers to emphasize that part of the story , and hope for even slower cost growth once Obamacare is fully operational . But there isn’t anything in the data to justify his claim that the health care bill as a whole is being vindicated by recession-era trends . The question isn’t whether some of the things that the law does could have a positive effect on cost inflation : They clearly could ! It’s whether the as-yet-unimplemented totality of the bill — the $ 1 trillion in new spending and the thicket of new regulations as well as all the pilot programs and payment reforms — will bend the cost curve up or down . And there I think conservatives still have every reason to be skeptical .
News from New York : it looks as if insurance premiums on the individual market are going to plunge thanks to Obamacare . This shouldn’t come as a surprise ; in fact , the New York experience perfectly illustrates why Obamacare had to look the way it does . And it also illustrates why conservatives should be terrified about this legislation , as it takes effect . Americans may have had a lot of misgivings in advance , thanks to vast , deliberately spread misinformation . But I agree with Matt Yglesias — unless the GOP finds even more ways to sabotage the plan , this thing is going to work , it’s going to be extremely popular , and it’s going to wreak havoc with conservative ideology .To understand what’s happening in New York , you have to start with what almost everyone at least pretends to believe : Americans shouldn’t find it impossible to get health insurance because of pre-existing conditions that aren’t their fault . Two decades ago , New York tried to deal with this by imposing community rating : insurance is available to everyone , and the price doesn’t depend on your medical history .The problem was that this created a death spiral : young , healthy people didn’t buy insurance , worsening the risk pool , driving up premiums , driving out more relatively healthy people , etc. , until you were left with a rump of very ill people paying very high rates .How do you deal with this ? Well , ideally , Medicare for all . But since that wasn’t going to happen , you improve the risk pool by requiring everyone to buy insurance — the individual mandate . And since some people won’t be able to afford that , you also offer subsidies . Voila ! ObamaRomneycare !Where does the money for the subsidies come from ? Partly by reducing corporate welfare : reducing overpayments for Medicare Advantage , reducing tax breaks for very generous insurance plans ; partly with new taxes on the wealthy .And while a few people will be hurt — young , healthy individuals too affluent to qualify for subsidies , wealthy taxpayers , etc . — a much larger number of people will be helped , some of them enormously .Does this amount to “redistribution” ? Well , yes — not as an end in itself , but yes , a lot of people will be made better off at the expense of an affluent few .And Yglesias is right : there will be bobbles along the way , but this is going to become an immensely popular program . By the time Liz Cheney challenges Hillary Clinton’s reelection campaign , there will be signs at the rallies declaring “Don’t let the government get its hands on Obamacare ! ”Conservatives are right to be hysterical about this : it’s an attack on everything they believe — and it’s going to make Americans’ lives better . What could be worse ?
Newt Gingrich has acknowledged that his tendency to spout off like a political analyst might get him into trouble on the campaign trail .On Monday , Mr. Gingrich , the former speaker of the House , sought to explain away just that kind of Sunday-morning pontification , in which he blasted the budget by his Republican colleagues in Congress and endorsed an individual mandate for health insurance .“I am completely opposed to the Obamacare mandate on individuals , ” Mr. Gingrich said in a new video released Monday . “I fought it for two and half years at the Center for Health Transformation . You can see all the things we did to stop it at HealthTransformation.net . I am for the repeal of Obamacare and I am against any effort to impose a federal mandate on anyone because it is fundamentally wrong and I believe unconstitutional.”The video was a quick attempt to walk back from his comments on NBC‘s “Meet the Press” on Sunday .“I agree that all of us have a responsibility to help pay for health care . And I think that there are ways to do it that make most libertarians relatively happy , ” Mr. Gingrich told the host David Gregory . “I’ve said consistently , where there’s some requirement you either have health insurance or you post a bond or in some way you indicate you’re going to be held accountable.”Mr. Gingrich also said on the show that he’s uncomfortable with the proposed changes to Medicare in the budget put forth by Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin , the chairman of the House budget committee .“I don’t think right-wing social engineering is any more desirable than left-wing social engineering , ” Mr. Gingrich said Sunday . “I don’t think imposing radical change from the right or the left is a very good way for a free society to operate.”That brought a quick retort from Mr. Ryan on Monday morning , who asked on a conservative radio program , “With allies like that , who needs the left ? ”Rick Tyler , a spokesman for Mr. Gingrich , sought to soften his boss’s comments . In an e-mail to The Weekly Standard , Mr. Tyler wrote that “there is little daylight between Ryan and Gingrich.”“But look how it gets reported , ” Mr. Tyler continued . “Newt would fully support Ryan if it were not compulsory . We need to design a better system that people will voluntarily move to . That is a major difference in design but not substance.”
No taper , at least yet . Government shutdown and maybe debt ceiling crisis looming . Obamacare rollout begins in a couple of weeks . There are a lot of important things happening in the world .But we all have lives , too — and here in our household the sad news of the day was the end of the road for our surviving cat , Albert Einstein . We did the necessary for his sister Doris Lessing last fall ; today Albert had reached the point where he could no longer stand up , and it was time to say goodbye . From happier days ( Doris on the left , Albert on the right ) :Albert was almost 21 .

Now that Republicans are set to control both houses of Congress , the great question is : What will they do with it ?The message from Washington ( and Louisville , Ky. , where the incoming Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell spoke ) on Wednesday was of constructive desire to find areas for common ground . The question is what concrete legislation that might lead to , and whether it will dissolve the first time that concrete legislation makes its way to the Senate floor .As we wrote earlier , moments like this — when a president in his final two years of an eight-year run faces a sharply hostile Congress — are certainly not when big , ideologically polarizing legislation is likely to be enacted . Republicans may have a comfortable majority in both the House and Senate , after all , but not enough votes to override a presidential veto . My colleague Carl Hulse reports that Republicans are eager to show they can be a governing party and seek to move legislation that many Congressional Democrats might object to but which Mr. Obama is likely to sign .When there has meaningful lawmaking in this environment , it has tended to be on more below-the-radar issues in which the party leading Congress has greater enthusiasm . Analysts who try to handicap what will happen in Washington have been grappling with what , if anything , that might consist of in the 114th Congress , which begins in January . Here’s a rundown of the possibilities .Keeping the government running .Republicans will have to decide how aggressively they will use the need to fund the government to extract policy concessions from the Obama administration . Will these be the Republicans of 2011 through 2013 , when a hard-edged approach culminated in a two-week government shutdown driven by demands that the president agree to a repeal of his signature health reform law ?Or will they be the Republicans of 2014 , who presented themselves as a responsible governing party while looking to chip away at Obamacare and other White House priorities piece-by-piece and without a grand , disruptive showdown ?One way or another , the debt ceiling will need to be raised sometime in the first part of 2015 to prevent a government default , and deals will need to be made to continue funding the federal government without the high drama of standoffs like that over the debt ceiling in 2011 , the “fiscal cliff” of late 2012 and the shutdown in 2013 .It will pit two sides of the G.O.P . against each other . One team of Republican leadership seeks to bolster the party’s brand in the run-up to 2016 elections and is responsive to business interests who prefer stability . The other is the harder-right contingent of the caucus that wants to try to shut down Obamacare at any cost . Presidential politics may come into play as well , as potential candidates like Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky push for a harder-edged approach than that preferred by the majority leader Mitch McConnell . ( “Let me be clear : There will be no shutdowns and no default on the national debt , ” Mr. McConnell said Wednesday in his appearance in Louisville ) .Sean West , who heads the United States practice of the Eurasia Group , a political risk consultancy , argues that the odds of a return to disruptive showdowns of the recent past is only about 25 percent . “The Republicans have no incentives to play games , ” he said . “They’re focused on looking like a party that can govern.”A trade deal on the way ?The likelihood of a major trade deal with Pacific Rim nations is , if anything , higher after the Republican victory than before . The soon-to-be-former Senate majority leader , Harry Reid , and many other Democrats have been skeptical of further American trade agreements because of union opposition and a fear of the impact of continued globalization on American wages . The Obama administration has pursued the deals , viewing them both as positive for American exporters and as part of a geopolitical strategy of creating stronger ties with Asian nations that can counter Chinese influence .So the Obama administration may have better luck with the Republican Senate than it would have with a Democrat-led chamber in obtaining passage of the Trans-Pacific Partnership , a sweeping trade agreement with 11 countries stretching from Japan to New Zealand to Chile .That said , there are many hurdles to getting a complicated deal done . They need to finesse a two-step process in which Mr. Obama first wins “trade promotion authority” to fast-track negotiations and then separately secures passage of a finished agreement , which has many moving parts . Early signs are that the Republican Congress could move on that authority early next year .Republicans will probably demand greater heed to businesses’ wishes than the organized labor and environmental concerns that are priorities for Obama . And with just over two years left in his presidency , the clock is ticking .A second trade agreement , with Europe , known as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership , is moving more slowly and will be even more challenging for Mr. Obama and congressional Republicans to enact in the coming two years .Is it time to overhaul the corporate income tax ?The tax system for American corporations is , by all accounts , a mess . It places higher tax rates on businesses than most other advanced nations , yet raises less revenue relative to the economy thanks to a byzantine set of carve-outs and special deductions . It makes possible so-called corporate inversions , in which American firms cut their tax bill by buying a smaller company overseas and relocating their headquarters . The tax code hasn’t been systematically reformed since 1986 .In other words , it would seem ready made for a bipartisan compromise to cut the rate , cut the deductions , and make the system overall more fair and efficient . It is easy in theory to imagine a bill that a Republican Congress might pass that President Obama would happily sign . “The political noise on inversions obscures the broad similarity of the political parties’ approach to tax reform , ” wrote Terry Haines , head of political analysis at ISI Evercore , in a report . “If anything , the continued inversions controversy continues to provide a powerful stimulus for both parties to address the fundamental noncompetitiveness of the U.S. tax code.”The challenge is not the theory , but the practical dimensions .Tax reform legislation is almost by definition a hard slog even when the parties broadly agree , pitting lobbyists for companies that win from the changes against those who would lose . Things are also complicated by Republicans’ desire to keep reform of the individual income tax code on the table as part of the process , with an eye toward reducing tax rates — most likely a nonstarter for Mr. Obama and other Democrats .Some less likely policies .There are other areas that superficially would seem to fit the model of a policy area where there is room for bipartisan compromise , but in which legislation appears unlikely to make it to President Obama’s desk before he leaves office .First , immigration reform . Although the Senate passed a bipartisan immigration bill last year , it has been bogged down in the House as conservative members object to what they see as amnesty for illegal immigrants . While the bill , or one like it , has strong support in the business community , as a practical matter it’s not clear that anything has happened that would change that dynamic . If anything , Congress has become more conservative .Second , housing finance reform . Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been under government control since 2008 , leaving the government managing a vast proportion of the mortgage market .But Democrats and Republicans remain far apart on how much government support should exist for home lending in any deal , and neither side shows much interest in compromising . Throw in the fact that the status quo is working O.K. , making a lot of money for taxpayers and keeping a flow of cheap money into housing that makes the politically powerful real estate industry happy , and it’s not clear what would force a compromise .Given those realities , writes Brian Gardner , an analyst at Keefe , Bruyette & Woods , a financial services consultancy , “we remain confident that mortgage finance legislation is unlikely to pass Congress until 2017 at the earliest.”That’s what everyone wants to hear : confidence in Washington .
Now that it seems that the sheer force of Ted Cruz’s ( genuinely remarkable ! ) physical stamina won’t be enough to bring Obamacare to its knees , it’s worth stepping back and saying something about the current prospects for an actual conservative replacement for/reform of Obamacare . Two recent pieces on this subject recommend themselves : One is in the latest National Affairs , where Thomas Miller offers an extended “reality check” on the pressing need for and current unreadiness of Republican health care alternatives ; the other is over at Bloomberg View , where Ramesh Ponnuru presents a gentle critique of one such alternative , from the Republican Study Committee , praising some of its features while suggesting ( correctly ) that it would need to include an actual tax credit for the purchase of insurance to represent a plausible replacement for the president’s health care law .The absence of such a credit , sadly , is not a coincidence . As I’ve noted before , a lot of Congressional Republicans are resistant to the more plausible conservative proposals on health care precisely because they don’t want to find the money required to make any of them work — in some cases because they prefer the comforting illusion that the current system represents some sort of free market ideal that would be wrecked if we started providing tax credits to the currently-uninsured , and in other cases because they’re all-too-aware that some of that money would have to come from caps and cuts that affect groups that currently vote Republican . This has left health care as the glaring exception to the pattern of policy innovation I discussed in Sunday’s column : The party’s populists have been willing to take interesting risks on a variety of issues , but on health care it’s mostly just been “repeal , repeal , repeal” with entirely-insufficient gestures offered as replacements .Which is why Josh Barro , professional scourge of G.O.P . unseriousness , feels comfortable dismissing Miller’s argument ( and by implication , Ponnuru’s ) as follows:Though Miller spends 6,000 words laying out his health policy vision , he never explicitly notes two facts about his approach : It would cost a lot of taxpayer money to implement , and it wouldn’t achieve universal health coverage . The former makes the approach a nonstarter for so many conservatives that no Republican Congress would ever implement it . The latter makes it unsaleable to the broader electorate .On the second point , I think he’s mistaken , or at least oversimplifying ( not least because Obamacare itself doesn’t achieve universal health coverage ) , but I’ll just direct you to Reihan Salam’s comments on the universality issue and focus on Barro’s first claim : That “no Republican Congress would ever implement” the ideas that conservative policy wonks have proposed .For this Republican Congress he’s most likely right , the efforts of a few lawmakers notwithstanding , for the reasons sketched above . For the next one or especially the one after that , though , I think the calculus could very easily change . That’s because right now , with the new health care law as-yet-unimplemented , we’re still in a world where the G.O.P.’s politicians and activists and interest groups think of themselves as working from a pre-Obamacare policy baseline . And this , in in turn , creates a strong political reluctance to propose alternatives that deviate from that baseline in ways that might negatively impact the groups — including , as Barro says , “the overwhelmingly insured Republican electorate” — that the party has tried to rally against the health care law from the beginning .But the first moment when a Republican Congress might actually be able to pass a health care overhaul won’t arrive until February of 2017 , at which point Obamacare will have been the baseline for two years — the new taxes , the subsidies , the mandates , the higher premiums , the Medicare cuts , the Medicaid expansion , all of it . And at that point , the plausible right-of-center alternatives to Obamacare will no longer look risky and disruptive relative to the status quo , because that status quo will no longer be one that Republican interests and voters are deeply invested in defending . Instead , those interests and voters will be looking for ways to limit the health care law’s impact , and the conservative alternatives will look more like what they actually are — proposals that spend less , regulate less , and reflect a greater confidence in markets than the president’s new law , and that would change the underlying health care system in ways that a sensible G.O.P . should support .This may be too optimistic , I admit . Maybe Ted Cruz will be elected president on a platform of repeal-plus-nothing ; maybe Hillary Clinton will be elected president and the G.O.P . will go on fundraising off Obamacare without ever figuring out how to change it ; maybe a Republican Congress and a Republican President will fall short of repeal but tinker with the law in ways that are more destructive than constructive . But I do think that the more serious policy alternatives on the right will look a lot better , both to the G.O.P.’s true believers and its strategic cynics , in world where Obamacare is the policy of the land as well as the law , and where the party’s base is no longer being invited to imagine that it can be pre-emptively wiped out .

OK , I just created an Obamacare account for myself ( if I broke any laws , please , it was just investigative journalism ) . I went all the way through the process at healthcare.gov , stopping before the final step of actually applying ( I don’t qualify , of course , because Princeton provides insurance ) , just to see how hard it was . And the answer is that it was no problem at all , with no delays .I also used the information only feature to get a listing of plans in my area . Again , no problem . And healthcare.gov directs you to Kaiser for an estimate of subsidies and final cost .Now , I know that this is only part of the story , and we’re still not getting clear answers on how well the 834 transmissions — which send the information to insurers — are working . But the visible parts of the process bear no resemblance to the horror stories of a few weeks ago .Why did I carry out this little exercise ? Well , I scanned the comments on today’s column and noticed a lot of people reporting having successfully enrolled in Obamacare — not at one of the well-functioning state exchanges , but at the supposedly disastrous healthcare.gov . Just anecdotes , I know — but anecdotes suggesting that the system is no longer the black hole of yore .In short , it’s looking increasingly likely that the story from here on is going to be one of steadily better news — of growing enrollment in the federal as well as state exchanges , of people discovering either that their insurance has gotten better and cheaper or that they can afford insurance for the first time . Bit by bit these stories will percolate into the news media , replacing the sob stories about cancelled policies .And I find myself wondering what Republicans will do . Or actually , not so much . As Martin Longman noted over the weekend , Obamacare already looks like one of those Republican obsessions — like Benghazi — where the party has convinced itself that there must be a pony winning issue hidden in there somewhere , and that if only it keeps flogging the thing , long after the public has moved on , it will eventually score big .I’m not saying that the botched rollout is irrelevant : it has badly hurt Obama , and may do damage that lasts into the midterms . But the facts on the ground are changing , and my very strong guess is that the GOP will undo a lot of its gains by refusing to acknowledge that change .

OK , nothing is sure in this world . Intrade is still giving Obamacare a 2.2 % chance of failing , and I suppose Bart Stupak might have a Bwahahaha moment on the House floor . But it looks as if health reform has been achieved .There is , as always , a tunnel at the end of the tunnel : we’ll spend years if not decades fixing this thing . But kudos to all involved , with special praise for Nancy Pelosi , who is now a Speaker for the ages .PS : I really did take that photo , but it was back in January . Right now I’m back in central New Jersey .
OK , so Obama did a terrible job in the debate , and Romney did well . But in the end , this isn’t or shouldn’t be about theater criticism , it should be about substance . And the fact is that everything Obama said was basically true , while much of what Romney said was either outright false or so misleading as to be the moral equivalent of a lie .Above all , there’s this:MR. ROMNEY : Let — well , actually — actually it’s — it’s — it’s a lengthy description , but number one , pre-existing conditions are covered under my plan .No , they aren’t . Romney’s advisers have conceded as much in the past ; last night they did it again .I guess you could say that Romney’s claim wasn’t exactly a lie , since some people with preexisting conditions would retain coverage . But as I said , it’s the moral equivalent of a lie ; if you think he promised something real , you’re the butt of a sick joke .And we’re talking about a lot of people left out in the cold — 89 million , to be precise .Furthermore , all of this should be taken in the context of Romney’s plan not just to repeal Obamacare but to drastically cut Medicaid .So enough with the theater criticism ; Romney needs to be held accountable for dishonesty on a huge scale .

OK , the plan is out . Basically , it splits the difference between the House and Senate bills , with a set of measures that can be passed through reconciliation . Igor Volsky has a nice table doing the comparison . Since the House bill is better than the Senate bill , and the Senate bill is much better than nothing , this should be a go .What I hear is that at this point the House is a bigger problem than the Senate . Pelosi — and Obama — have to drive home the following points : 1 . This is the last chance to do HCR for years to come , and America desperately needs this 2 . For their own sake , Democrats have to run on a record of having achieved something .I’m not in a position to do nose-counts , but I’m guardedly optimistic .
ON the subject of the Affordable Care Act — Obamacare , to reclaim the name critics have made into a slur — a number of fallacies seem to be congealing into accepted wisdom . Much of this is the result of unrelenting Republican propaganda and right-wing punditry , but it has gone largely unchallenged by gun-shy Democrats . The result is that voters are confronted with slogans and side issues — “It’s a tax ! ” “No , it’s a penalty ! ” — rather than a reality-based discussion . Let’s unpack a few of the most persistent myths .OBAMACARE IS A JOB-KILLER . The House Republican majority was at it again last week , staging the 33rd theatrical vote to roll back the Affordable Care Act . And once again the cliché of the day was “job-killer.” After years of trying out various alarmist falsehoods the Republicans have found one that seems , judging from the polls , to have connected with the fears of voters .Some of the job-killer scare stories are based on a deliberate misreading of a Congressional Budget Office report that estimated the law would “reduce the amount of labor used in the economy” by about 800,000 jobs . Sounds like a job-killer , right ? Not if you read what the C.B.O . actually wrote . While some low-wage jobs might be lost , the C.B.O . number mainly refers to workers who — being no longer so dependent on employers for their health-care safety net — may choose to retire earlier or work part time . Those jobs would then be open for others who need them .The impartial truth squad FactCheck.org has debunked the job-killer claim so many times that in its latest update you can hear a groan of weary frustration : words like “whopper” and “bogus” and “hooey.” The job-killer claim is also discredited by the experience under the Massachusetts law on which Obamacare was modeled .Ultimately the Affordable Care Act could be a tonic for the economy . It aims to slow the raging growth of health care costs by , among other things , using the government’s Medicare leverage to move doctors away from exorbitant fee-for-service medicine , with its incentive to pile on unnecessary procedures . Two veteran health economists , David Cutler of Harvard and Karen Davis , president of the Commonwealth Fund , have calculated that over the first decade of Obamacare total spending on health care , in part by employers , will be half a trillion dollars lower than under the status quo .OBAMACARE IS A FEDERAL TAKEOVER OF HEALTH INSURANCE . Let’s be blunt . The word for that is “lie.” The main thing the law does is deliver millions of new customers to the private insurance industry . Indeed , a significant portion of the unhappiness with Obamacare comes from liberals who believe it is not nearly federal enough : that the menu of insurance choices should have included a robust public option , or that Medicare should have been expanded into a form of universal coverage .Under the law , to be sure , insurance will be governed by new regulations , and supported by new subsidies . This is not the law Ayn Rand would have written . But the share of health care spending that comes from the federal government is expected to rise only modestly , to nearly 50 percent in 2021 , and much of that is due not to Obamacare but to baby boomers joining Medicare .This is a “federal takeover” only in the crazy world where Barack Obama is a “socialist.”THE UNFETTERED MARKETPLACE IS A BETTER SOLUTION . To the extent there is a profound difference of principle anywhere in this debate , it lies here .

ON the subject of the Affordable Care Act — Obamacare , to reclaim the name critics have made into a slur — a number of fallacies seem to be congealing into accepted wisdom . Much of this is the result of unrelenting Republican propaganda and right-wing punditry , but it has gone largely unchallenged by gun-shy Democrats . The result is that voters are confronted with slogans and side issues — “It’s a tax ! ” “No , it’s a penalty ! ” — rather than a reality-based discussion . Let’s unpack a few of the most persistent myths .OBAMACARE IS A JOB-KILLER . The House Republican majority was at it again last week , staging the 33rd theatrical vote to roll back the Affordable Care Act . And once again the cliché of the day was “job-killer.” After years of trying out various alarmist falsehoods the Republicans have found one that seems , judging from the polls , to have connected with the fears of voters .Some of the job-killer scare stories are based on a deliberate misreading of a Congressional Budget Office report that estimated the law would “reduce the amount of labor used in the economy” by about 800,000 jobs . Sounds like a job-killer , right ? Not if you read what the C.B.O . actually wrote . While some low-wage jobs might be lost , the C.B.O . number mainly refers to workers who — being no longer so dependent on employers for their health-care safety net — may choose to retire earlier or work part time . Those jobs would then be open for others who need them .The impartial truth squad FactCheck.org has debunked the job-killer claim so many times that in its latest update you can hear a groan of weary frustration : words like “whopper” and “bogus” and “hooey.” The job-killer claim is also discredited by the experience under the Massachusetts law on which Obamacare was modeled .Ultimately the Affordable Care Act could be a tonic for the economy . It aims to slow the raging growth of health care costs by , among other things , using the government’s Medicare leverage to move doctors away from exorbitant fee-for-service medicine , with its incentive to pile on unnecessary procedures . Two veteran health economists , David Cutler of Harvard and Karen Davis , president of the Commonwealth Fund , have calculated that over the first decade of Obamacare total spending on health care , in part by employers , will be half a trillion dollars lower than under the status quo .OBAMACARE IS A FEDERAL TAKEOVER OF HEALTH INSURANCE . Let’s be blunt . The word for that is “lie.” The main thing the law does is deliver millions of new customers to the private insurance industry . Indeed , a significant portion of the unhappiness with Obamacare comes from liberals who believe it is not nearly federal enough : that the menu of insurance choices should have included a robust public option , or that Medicare should have been expanded into a form of universal coverage .Under the law , to be sure , insurance will be governed by new regulations , and supported by new subsidies . This is not the law Ayn Rand would have written . But the share of health care spending that comes from the federal government is expected to rise only modestly , to nearly 50 percent in 2021 , and much of that is due not to Obamacare but to baby boomers joining Medicare .This is a “federal takeover” only in the crazy world where Barack Obama is a “socialist.”THE UNFETTERED MARKETPLACE IS A BETTER SOLUTION . To the extent there is a profound difference of principle anywhere in this debate , it lies here . Conservatives contend that if you give consumers a voucher or a tax credit and set them loose in the marketplace they will do a better job than government at finding the services — schools , retirement portfolios , or in this case health insurance policies — that fit their needs .I’m a pretty devout capitalist , and I see that in some cases individual responsibility helps contain wasteful spending on health care . If you have to share the cost of that extra M.R.I . or elective surgery , you’ll think hard about whether you really need it . But I’m deeply suspicious of the claim that a health care system dominated by powerful vested interests and mystifying in its complexity can be tamed by consumers who are strapped for time , often poor , sometimes uneducated , confused and afraid .“Ten percent of the population accounts for 60 percent of the health outlays , ” said Davis . “They are the very sick , and they are not really in a position to make cost-conscious choices.”LEAVE IT TO THE STATES . THEY’LL FIX IT . The Republican alternative to Obamacare consists in large part of letting each state do its own thing . Presumably the best ideas will go viral .States do have a long history of pioneering new ideas , sometimes enlightened ( Oregon’s vote-by-mail comes to mind ) and sometimes less benign ( see Florida’s loopy gun laws ) . Obamacare actually underwrites pilot programs to reduce costs , and gives states freedom — some would argue too much freedom — in designing insurance-buying exchanges . But the best ideas don’t spread spontaneously . Some states are too poor to adopt worthwhile reforms . Some are intransigent , or held captive by lobbies .
ORLANDO , Florida — Florida 's own health insurance marketplace , long touted by Republican lawmakers as a free-market solution to providing affordable health coverage , is expected to launch as early as next week .Six years in the making , Florida Health Choices will open for business with an inventory of products that can not legally be marketed using the words insurance , coverage , benefits or premiums , according to Chief Executive Officer Rose Naff .The brainchild of U.S . Senator Marco Rubio while he was a state legislative leader in 2008 , Florida Health Choices has been held up by advocates as a better alternative to President Obama 's signature Affordable Care Act .Signed into law in 2010 , the U.S . Affordable Care Act , also known as Obamacare , went live on October 1 and by late January had enrolled 3 million people .The law created state-based online health insurance exchanges that opened on October 1 for coverage on January 1 and sell plans with minimum benefit requirements .The Florida products do not meet the comprehensive requirements of Obamacare , and Naff said there is no timetable for Florida Health Choices to offer broader insurance plans that meet the new federal benefit standards .Subsidies provided in the federal program would also not be available through the state site .`` We are not competing with the federal exchanges , '' Naff said .Naff said Florida Health Choices initially will make available five types of discount cards that offer purchasers a better deal on certain dental , vision , prescription or chiropractic services .The cards , which are offered by Careington International based in Frisco , Texas , will cost $ 6 to $ 25 a month , depending on the services selected .Naff said other products , including limited-benefit insurance plans , which focus on single medical issues such as cancer or vision , will be rolled out at a later date .Florida is one of 36 states where the federal government is running the exchange , called HealthCare.gov . The other 14 states run their own exchanges .Naff said there are 1.3 million people in Florida who are uninsured and ineligible for subsidies in the federal marketplace .Florida has about 3.8 million uninsured people , or about 20 percent of its population , according to the U.S. Census Bureau .Florida 's Governor Rick Scott signed off on state funding of Florida Health Choices while trying to block the Affordable Care Act and rejecting millions of federal dollars to implement it in the state .Florida led the legal challenge against Obamacare , but the U.S. Supreme Court in 2012 upheld most provisions of the act . Scott continued to throw roadblocks in the way of Obamacare , banning `` navigators , '' volunteers who help consumers sign up for insurance in the federal marketplace , from operating out of state-funded county health departments .The state marketplace was No . 87 in Rubio 's 2006 book , `` 100 Innovative Ideas for Florida 's Future , '' published months before he took over as leader of the Florida House . Rubio made the marketplace a priority and obtained $ 1.5 million in start-up funding in 2008 . Another $ 900,000 of state funding was awarded in 2013 .`` Florida Health Choices is a program based on principles ObamaCare violated , '' a spokeswoman for Rubio said in a statement on Friday . `` There are no mandates , trillions in new spending , or bureaucratic rules to come between patients and their doctors , '' she added .Greg Mellowe , policy director at Florida CHAIN , a statewide consumer health advocacy group , said the state 's version provided `` an illusion of coverage . ''`` In some cases , these things are not insurance at all , '' Mellowe added .Naff said potential Florida Health Choices customers are 525,000 adults who make too much money to qualify for Medicaid . Those same people would qualify for Medicaid coverage if Florida 's Republican-dominated legislature would accept $ 51 billion from the federal government to expand Medicaid 's income guidelines , Naff said .The legislature , whose leaders fought the Affordable Care Act , declined the money in 2013 .Other potential customers are about 800,000 non-citizens living in the state who are not eligible under the Affordable Care Act , Naff said .( Additional reporitng by Zachary Fagenson and Caroline Humer .

ORLANDO , Florida — In a race being watched as a potential bellwether for this year 's mid-term congressional elections , Republicans cast their votes in a special primary election on Tuesday in a key Florida swing district .The vote in the state 's 13th Congressional District was to fill the vacancy left by the death in October of U.S. Representative Bill Young , a moderate Republican who had held the seat for 42 years .Once reliably Republican , the district along Florida 's Gulf coast has backed the party 's presidential nominee only once since 1988 . Former President George W. Bush , a Republican , won 51 percent of the district 's votes in 2004 but it went for President Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 .The Republican primary winner will face Democrat Alex Sink , the state 's former chief financial officer and the 2010 nominee for governor , in a general election on March 11 . Libertarian Lucas Overby also will be on the ballot .Sink , considered the strong front-runner , has raised more than $ 1 million in campaign contributions , more than all three Republican candidates combined , according to the latest campaign filings .`` It 's Sink 's to lose , '' said Susan MacManus , a Tampa-based political scientist at the University of South Florida .MacManus said the race is being watched to gauge the possible impact Obamacare may have in the November 4 midterm elections when all 435 U.S. House members - including the winner of this seat - will be on the ballot .`` People are looking at it as kind of a bellwether on whether Obamacare is going to hurt a Democrat in the general election , '' MacManus said .Sink supports Obamacare and the three Republican candidates vying to become the nominee have said they would support repealing it .MacManus said the 13th congressional district skews older , whiter and politically transitional , with registered Republicans currently outnumbering Democrats by only 37.1 percent to 34.7 percent .Some Republicans have been disappointed that none of the party 's heavy hitters chose to challenge Sink .However , should Sink win , a new Republican candidate could emerge to take her on in November , MacManus said .The Republican candidates on Tuesday 's ballots are little known outside the district .David Jolly , a Washington lobbyist , stresses his long experience as Young 's congressional aide .

ORLANDO , Florida — Republican David Jolly won an expensive battle to fill a vacant U.S. Congressional seat in a special election watched by both major parties for what it portends for November when all 435 congressional seats will be up for grabs .Jolly , 41 , defeated Democrat challenger Alex Sink , 65 , a former state chief financial officer , by 3,500 votes or a 1.87 percent margin - 48.43 percent to 46.56 percent , according to the Pinellas County Supervisor of Elections website .Libertarian candidate Lucas Overby took 4.83 percent of the votes .Republicans were quick to declare the result a repudiation of President Obama 's Affordable Healthcare Act , known as Obamacare .Jolly 's victory `` shows that voters are looking for representatives who will fight to end the disaster of Obamacare , to get Washington to spend our money responsibly , '' Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement .Jolly did not mention Obamacare in his victory speech and said that his margin of victory was too slim to `` take a mandate from this . ''In his victory speech , Jolly spurned national attention on the election . `` This race is not about defending a broken agenda in Washington , '' he told supporters . `` This race is about ... . serving the people right here in our own community . ''Sink had held a slight lead in the polls throughout the campaign against Jolly , a Republican lobbyist in Washington , D.C. , but may have been hurt by poor turnout of 39 percent , far below the 2012 election .Florida 's is a big swing state , with 27 seats in the House of Representatives , tied with New York state for the third largest delegation in the nation , and behind only California and Texas .A Democratic victory would have been a major blow to the Republican party heading into the fall mid-term elections , as well as the next presidential race in 2016 . Democrats hold the advantage in the more liberal south of the state and Republicans prevail in the conservative north , while central Florida is more evenly split .The Tampa area Gulf Coast district has been a comfortable Republican seat for decades , held for more than 40 years by Jolly 's former boss , U.S. Representative C.W . Bill Young , a Republican who died in October aged 82 .Young won the seat in 2012 by almost 50,000 votes and a margin of 15 percent . However , the district was won by President Barack Obama in 2012 , according to the Tampa Bay Times .Voters were hit with more than $ 10 million worth of television advertising and other campaign material financed in large part by the national parties and partisan groups hoping a victory in this race will signal the prospect of a bigger win in the November mid-term elections .`` You can see the handprints of the national parties all over the race , '' said Susan MacManus , a longtime political analyst and professor at the University of South Florida in Tampa .`` It almost seems as if the 2012 presidential race never ended , and just the faces and the district changed . ''Sink slammed Jolly as a Washington lobbyist for special interests , while Jolly fired back at Sink for being close to President Obama and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi .Republicans hold a 2.4 percent edge in voter registration in Florida 's congressional district 13 , which lies within Pinellas County on the state 's west coast .MacManus said an early focus on Obamacare got little traction because older voters were not affected . Sink switched to criticizing Jolly for representing a client who wanted to privatize Social Security and turn Medicare into a voucher program , changes Jolly said he does not support .`` This is a strategy I think Democrats are looking at nationally to change the focus from Obamacare to Social Security and Medicare , '' MacManus said .Following the election , MacManus expects both parties to use the Tampa Bay area , the nation 's 10th largest television market and home to 25 percent of all registered Florida voters , as a political laboratory to conduct focus group surveys on the campaign strategies .It was a crushing defeat for Sink who narrowly lost the election for state governor in 2010 against Republican Rick Scott .Sink conceded victory soon after the results were announced but did not say whether she will challenge Jolly again in November when his seat is up again for election .( Writing by David Adams ; Editing by Ken Wills )
ORLANDO — Diners at a Florida restaurant chain are being asked to pay a health insurance surcharge on their meal tabs to cover the cost for business owners of the Obama administration 's new healthcare program .Customers at eight Gator 's Dockside restaurants dotted around central and north Florida are finding a 1 percent surcharge on their bills listed as `` ACA , '' the letters standing for the Affordable Care Act , popularly known as Obamacare .Lengthy signs on the front door and a plastic-coated letter delivered to tables with the menu warn diners of the fee . `` The costs associated with ACA compliance could ultimately close our doors , '' the letter reads under the company letterhead .A $ 14.56 lunch tab for Asian salad and iced tea ordered by a reporter at a Dockside restaurant in the town of Clermont , a short drive west of Orlando , included a 13-cent ACA surcharge .Dockside said it wants to continue to offer full-time employment so its employees do n't have to work multiple jobs to make a living .`` Therefore , instead of raising prices on our products to generate the additional revenue needed to cover the cost of ACA compliance , Gator 's Dockside has implemented a 1 percent surcharge on all food and beverage purchases only , '' the notice adds .`` People got ta do what they got ta do to obey the law , '' said local business owner Sean Gumbert , 40 , a lunchtime customer at Gator 's Dockside in Clermont who opposes Obamacare .But other diners , including several who did n't like Obamacare , were less sympathetic to the restaurant 's dilemma , saying insurance was just another cost of doing business , similar to other business taxes , and had no place on a meal tab .`` It 's a game . If you want to play the game , customers can play the game too . Instead of 20 percent tip , he ( the waiter ) gets 18 percent , '' said Joe Lee , a retired federal worker .`` We did n't do this for any , any , any , any , any political reasons , '' said a company official who answered the phone at the company 's Orlando headquarters , but asked not to be named .`` It was done in all the greatest intentions . It was done to give everybody full healthcare without knocking their hours down and not charging ridiculous amounts of money to do it , '' he said .The Affordable Care Act requires all businesses with more than 50 full-time employees to provide health insurance for their staff , or to make a shared payment on their federal tax return . Originally due to go into effect in January , the requirement has been postponed until the end of the year .A dozen other independently owned restaurants in the Gator 's Dockside franchise are not imposing the surcharge .`` It 's clearly political , '' said Hank Fishkind , an Orlando-based economic consultant , noting that the company could have increased its meal prices to cover the extra healthcare cost without advertising it .`` If they want to display their politics in this way , that 's their right . Some customers , depending on their politics , might like it . Others will not , '' he said .Fishkind said he was unaware of any other company making a similar move , though some Florida hospitality firms have complained about the requirement under Obamacare to provide health insurance for part-time labor .`` It is a real issue , particularly in a state like Florida , because we have a concentration of restaurants and lodging companies , '' he said .( Writing and additional reporting by David Adams ; Editing by Jonathan Oatis )
October 1 is a watershed moment for Obamacare , because that’s the day people can start signing up for health insurance , online , through public exchanges . But against this backdrop , there are also signs of a sea change in how private employers will offer health insurance .WNYC’s Money Talking looks at how companies like Walgreens , IBM and Time Warner will offer health insurance as Obamacare takes effect . Joe Nocera and Rana Foroohar of Time magazine join Charlie Herman to discuss whether this is the beginning of the end of employer-paid healthcare .
Of course , they don’t . But much of the argument over health care amounts to insisting that they do .Aaron Carroll catches Steve Pearlstein saying that Obamacare and Ryancare are the same thing:Democrats have been equally hysterical in attacking Ryancare as a throw-Grandma-under-the-bus scheme to balance the budget , even as they proudly defend the health reform law for everyone else .As Carroll said , this is wrong in part because Ryancare would dismantle the much better system — Medicare — that seniors already have , while Obamacare would provide insurance to those who would not have it otherwise .But beyond that , the subsidies in the health care law are supposed to make care affordable ; the vouchers in Ryancare are not , and in fact would be grossly inadequate .So the argument that Ryancare is just like Obamacare is like saying that the company janitor , who gets paid $ 18,000 a year , and a senior vice president who gets paid 20 or 30 times that much both get paid salaries , so hey , they get exactly the same deal !It’s truly amazing that the Very Serious don’t get this point .
Oh , my . Aaron Carroll is rightly very , very annoyed at Douglas Holtz-Eakin and Arik Roy for saying that Obamacare should be replaced with a free-market system , like Switzerland’s . As he points out , the Swiss system is nothing like their description . In particular , they denounce community rating — but Switzerland has community rating !Actually , though , it’s even worse than Carroll lets on , for two reasons .One is that Obamacare in fact looks a lot like , you guessed it , the Swiss system — so much so that back in 2009 I described it as a plan to Swissfy America . After all the screaming about the awfulness of Obamacare , it’s pretty rich to hold up as a role model a very similar system .But wait , there’s more : the Swiss system is more privatized than other European systems — and guess what , it has higher costs , indeed second only to America’s:Maybe Holtz-Eakin doesn’t know anything about this — but wasn’t Roy supposed to be a conservative expert in this field ? Are they really unaware of the basics here ? Or do they just expect their readers to be easily fooled ?
On Monday , the Supreme Court will begin three days of arguments over the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act . The act is often called ''Obamacare , '' primarily by Republicans , as a term of disdain . Democrats have tried to limit the term 's use to reshape perceptions , but that has been a tough sell . Grant Barrett , a vice president for the American Dialect Society , says it is almost impossible to persuade people to discontinue the use of a political word . ''It 's an invitation to have your heart broken . You forbid it , and they start writing it on the bathroom stalls .

One big concern about health reform has been the argument that the individual mandate — which is essential to keeping the risk pool broad enough — won’t work , because the penalties for noncompliance are too weak . But Austin Frakt does some calculations which seem to suggest that the penalties for noncompliance under Obamacare are , if anything , slightly stronger than under Romneycare — and that since gaming of the system doesn’t seem to be a large problem in Massachusetts , it probably won’t be a big problem nationally .Hmm . What if this reform works better than its advocates claimed ?
One of the Senate’s top Democrats said Tuesday that it was a political mistake to pass the Affordable Care Act in 2010 , because voters at the time were looking for relief from the recession — not universal health care .In remarks at the National Press Club , Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York said Democrats should have built on the stimulus package that passed Congress and used it to create programs to help middle-class Americans .“Unfortunately , Democrats blew the opportunity the American people gave them , ” Mr. Schumer said , according to his prepared remarks . “We took their mandate and put all of our focus on the wrong problem – health care reform.”Mr. Schumer’s calculus could seem coldly political . He points out that only a third of the uninsured population is even registered to vote . “To aim a huge change in mandate at such a small percentage of the electorate made no political sense , ” he said . “So when Democrats focused on health care , the average middle-class person thought ‘the Democrats are not paying enough attention to me.’”Republicans , he added , were able to exploit a sense among voters that Democrats were interested in creating new government programs that did not benefit them , helping to spawn the Tea Party movement .“Republicans and the anti-government Tea Party filled that vacuum and spent 2010 convincing the average American that not only did Obamacare not work for them , not only would a parade of horribles emerge , ” he said , “but they turned Obamacare into a general metaphor and falsely convinced the electorate that government couldn’t work anywhere.”
Opponents of the Affordable Care Act yesterday seized on a Congressional Budget Office report on the labor market , claiming it indicated that health reform would “kill” 2 million jobs . Actually , as our editorial on the subject explained , the C.B.O . predicted a reduction in the number of full-time workers . That may sound like a distinction without a difference , but it’s not . “Job-killing” implies layoffs ; whereas the report found that many workers would choose to leave their positions — because they no longer have to depend on their employers for health insurance .Since there’s been so much confusion on this vital point , I thought I’d highlight what Douglas Elmendorf , the C.B.O . budget director , told the House Budget Committee on Wednesday . He clearly distinguished between getting laid off and choosing not to work:“The reason that we don’t use the term ‘lost jobs’ is because there is a critical difference between people who would like to work and can’t find a job — or have a job that was lost for reasons beyond their control — and people who choose not to work . If someone comes up to you and says , ‘Well the boss says I’m being laid off because we don’t have enough business to pay me , ’ that person feels bad about that and we sympathize with them for having lost their job . If someone says , ‘I decided to retire or stay home and spend more time with my family or spend more time doing my hobby , ’ they don’t feel bad about it — they feel good about it . And we don’t sympathize . We say congratulations . And we don’t say they’ve lost their job . We’ve say they’ve chosen to leave their job.”
Our topic for today is : looking on the post-election bright side .The polling places hadn’t even opened before the Senate’s right-wing firebrand , Ted Cruz , was demanding that the majority-leader in-waiting , Mitch McConnell , take a hard line against President Obama or risk losing his new job . Cruz is from Texas , and he wants to recreate the Alamo , if you can imagine Obamacare in disguise as the Mexican Army .Think of that as a plus . The one thing McConnell and his supporters dislike more than the Democratic agenda is Ted Cruz . It could be an important bonding opportunity . President Obama has never spent much time with the Republican leadership , but now you can sort of imagine them sitting around , sipping drinks and making fun of what Cruz said on Fox News .Another potential downer : Republicans have fewer veteran women in the Senate , so when they take over there will be fewer women running important committees . But , on the plus side , the overall number of women in Congress will rise , albeit at a rate that would get us to equal representation sometime around 2078 . Once all the votes are counted , Debbie Walsh , the director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University , says the percentage of women in the House and Senate , now 18.2 percent , will , at best , go up to “maybe 19.3” percent .“We’re calling it Not a Landmark Year , ” Walsh said .This could be a useful exercise in living with lowered expectations . Washington might actually want to embrace “Not a Landmark Year” as a slogan . If Ted Cruz tries to get the House Republicans to run the country off a fiscal cliff , the moderates could start chanting : “NALY ! NALY ! ”Let’s try one more positive interpretation of what the election has wrought : There’s a school of thought that believes Tuesday was actually a great day for reproductive rights . Let me take you through it .The front lines of the anti-abortion movement belong to the “personhood” people , who strive to give constitutional rights and protections to the “preborn” from the moment of conception . When Americans are confronted with this idea , they quickly come to hate it . Personhood amendments have been defeated wherever they pop up , including Mississippi . This year , one was rejected in Colorado for the third time , by around 65 percent to 35 percent . A personhood amendment lost in North Dakota , 64 percent to 36 percent . In addition , the state senator who was its major sponsor lost her re-election bid , as did one of the measure’s more outspoken House supporters .We are only mentioning those last details because the number of state legislators who are defeated for re-election in this country is about as low as the number of state legislators who are endowed with the power of levitation .This year , not only were the personhood proposals rejected , candidates who had previously supported the movement started madly backing away . The most famous example was in Colorado , where Representative Cory Gardner , the Republican Senate candidate , suddenly realized a state personhood amendment was a “bad idea.” In a move that left debate questioners incredulous , Gardner insisted that a personhood bill he had co-sponsored in Congress would have no effect , but was “simply a statement that I support life.”Gardner also announced that he believed birth control pills should be available over the counter . He made a TV ad about it and sent out pink mailings .Gardner’s turnaround was so swift and strange that the incumbent senator , Mark Udall , made it the center of his campaign . A Denver Post editorial claimed it was Udall’s “obnoxious” obsession . Now to me , obnoxious is a candidate who steals his opponent’s yard signs . Or who opposes abortions except for the one he pressured his mistress to get , like that guy in Tennessee . But whatever . Udall lost .Planned Parenthood sent out a press release describing Colorado as an absolute triumph : “Voters have made clear that you can’t win statewide elections in Colorado by openly opposing women’s health and restricting access to safe and legal abortion.”The theory here — and I am really going to go with it — is that the real story is not anti-choice Republicans weaseling around their political history , but voters of America forcing anti-choice candidates to change their positions .“Cory Gardner ran aggressively as a supporter of women’s issues . It was sort of a miraculous conversion . We’ll be happy to hold him to it , ” said Cecile Richards , the president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund , in a phone interview .The question is what happens when people like Gardner get into office . McConnell promised that he’d bring up a bill in the Senate banning abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy . Would the repentant personhood backers go along ? At the very least , they would appear to be obliged to add language vastly expanding women’s access to free birth control .O.K. , it’s not an ideal compromise . But then it’s not a landmark year .
PERRY , Ga. — One Republican highlights the nation 's lackluster recovery since the Great Recession . Less than an hour later , another GOP candidate from the same state gets attacked for it .Candidates everywhere this midterm election season are struggling for ways to frame the state of the economy , ranked by voters as the most important issue . The result is a blame game that cuts in multiple directions depending on the contest — even , in one case , within the same state .For example , Georgia Republican Senate nominee David Perdue does n't miss a chance to blame President Barack Obama and a Democratic-led Senate for the nation 's slow economic recovery .`` This president sold us a bill of goods , '' Perdue told a raucous crowd at the Georgia state fairgrounds during a debate with Democratic nominee Michelle Nunn this week . `` We have fewer working today than at any time since Jimmy Carter was president . ''Within moments , the state 's Republican governor , Nathan Deal , stood on the same stage while his Democratic challenger — Carter 's grandson — sharply blamed the governor for Georgia 's 8.1 percent unemployment rate , which in August was the nation 's highest .`` You have watched this economy in Georgia leave the middle class behind , '' said Jason Carter , a state senator .Even in states where rising unemployment might offer tempting targets , many candidates fear unintended consequences and political boomerangs if they delve too deeply into economic debates .Democrats in Republican-run states worry that an emphasis on economic woes might reflect badly on Obama , and by extension , themselves . But Republicans in those same states often worry that highlighting a shaky economy will reflect badly on the GOP governor and other Republicans .Perdue took that risk in Georgia , but other Senate candidates are more cautious .North Carolina is an example . The August unemployment rate was 6.8 percent , up from 6.2 percent in April — a potential opportunity for Sen. Kay Hagan , the Democrat seeking a second term .She accuses her Republican challenger — state House Speaker Thom Tillis — and GOP Gov . Pat McCrory of spearheading ill-advised tax and spending cuts . Hagan says their cuts to education funding drove away teachers this year and will hurt North Carolina 's job growth in future years .But Hagan had said little about the higher unemployment rate until she was asked about it in an Oct. 7 debate . She alluded to state legislative actions when she said Tillis ' tax and jobs policies were `` sending our teachers to Texas , our film jobs to Georgia and our Medicaid dollars to 28 states . '' Over Hagan 's objections , North Carolina 's GOP-controlled government declined a federally funded Medicaid expansion .Tillis ' approach : `` Government kills jobs , '' he said . `` Small businesses , large businesses create jobs . ''Outside the debate format , Tillis and Hagan tend to emphasize other issues .`` It 's a tough issue for both campaigns because neither one knows who the public will blame , '' said Thomas Mills , a Democratic blogger who has worked for statewide campaigns . Hagan has gained traction lately by hitting Tillis on education and tax issues , Mills said , `` so I 'm not sure she wants to change the subject right now . ''The story is similar in several other states with tight Senate races . Republicans need six more seats to control the chamber .In many states , Republicans seem content to stick with their longtime favorite issue : attacking the president 's health care overhaul , widely known as `` Obamacare . '' And several Democrats want to distance themselves from Obama , which complicates any effort to tout an improving economy associated with him .The national unemployment rate is 5.9 percent , the lowest in six years . But local unemployment rates have ticked up recently in four states with sharply contested Senate races : North Carolina , Louisiana , Alaska and Georgia .The unemployment rate has fallen in Colorado and Kentucky . It has been flat lately in Iowa , Arkansas and Kansas . All those states have contested Senate races .Unemployment plays a bigger role in races for governor , a post more directly associated with a state 's economy .In Wisconsin , Democrat Mary Burke centers her challenge to GOP Gov . Scott Walker on his failed promise to create 250,000 private-sector jobs . Wisconsin has the nation 's 17th-lowest unemployment rate , 5.6 percent .In Georgia , Carter is trying to deny Deal a second term as governor . Perdue and Nunn are running for the Senate seat being vacated by Republican Saxby Chambliss .Voters are left to decide who is responsible for the sluggish job growth in a state run by Republicans while the federal government is split between a GOP-run House and a Democratic-led Senate and White House .Even in states with falling unemployment rates , Senate candidates are reluctant to highlight the news .Kentuckians watching political TV ads might think their state 's unemployment rate , at 7.1 percent , has risen instead of fallen lately .Allies of Sen. Mitch McConnell , the Republican seeking a sixth term , have run ads in which a Kentucky coal miner says he lost his job thanks to a `` war on coal . '' McConnell repeatedly says Obama wages such a war with help from Democratic candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes , even though she sharply criticizes the president 's coal policies .___Babington reported from Washington .
PICKENS , Ark . — In a Senate race as pivotal as any in the country , Arkansas Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor is running against Republican Rep. Tom Cotton , who is running against President Barack Obama .All else is secondary , including a clash over agriculture and issues , a caustic tidal wave of television ads washing over voters and an intensive effort by Democrats to register thousands of new voters in a state that has turned several shades redder since Obama took office .Cotton is `` the only member of the Arkansas delegation , House or Senate , Republican or Democrat , to vote to raise the age for Medicare to 70 , '' Pryor said recently as he issued a campaign booklet that detailed spending cuts he said his opponent has supported in Congress . He also frequently points out that his challenger was the only lawmaker from Arkansas to oppose the most recent farm bill .Cotton 's reply ? The 37-year-old first-term House member scarcely seems to utter a sentence that does n't include the president 's name .`` I vote a hundred percent of the time with Arkansas ' best interests . He votes 93 percent of the time with Barack Obama , '' he said , adding : `` I do n't know many Arkansans who think that Barack Obama is right 93 percent of the time . ''Cotton is one of the many Republicans to inject Obama forcefully into his campaign in a year the GOP is battling for control of the Senate . Yet the Democrats ' multimillion-dollar program to turn out new , midterm election voters in key states will be tested in Arkansas as much as anywhere , given recent polls suggesting an exceedingly close race .Obama 's unpopularity in Arkansas is not in dispute , despite a Democratic tradition so thick that Roosevelt Road carries traffic up to the perimeter of the Bill and Hillary Clinton National Airport in the capital city . Six years ago , Pryor had no Republican opposition for re-election . Democrats held the state 's other Senate seat and three of four House seats .Enter the nation 's first black president , who drew less than 40 percent of the vote in the state in winning campaigns in 2008 and 2012 , and whose ratings now are in the low- to mid-30s . Pryor , now the only Democrat left in the state 's congressional delegation , concedes his try for a new term is probably made tougher by Obama 's shadow .Georgia Bowen , making calls at the Democratic phone bank in Little Rock , is an enthusiastic supporter of the health care law that Republicans first tagged — scathingly — with Obama 's name .`` When they 're calling it 'Obamacare ' they 're trying to insert race into something where race does n't belong , '' said the former teacher .Ninety miles away , William Moore , who served in the Pacific in the Air Force during the Vietnam era , cites two reasons he supports Cotton .`` He 's a veteran , '' he says , referring to the congressman 's tour in Afghanistan in an Army unit . And , `` I think he wants to do away with Obamacare . I 'm in favor of that . ''Cotton emphasizes his roots on an Arkansas farm in a recent television commercial , which appears designed to blunt Pryor 's attacks on his vote against the farm bill . And he travels in a campaign bus with a military-camouflage design on its exterior . He enlisted in 2005 , a few years after graduating from Harvard Law School .In the House , he voted for budgets advanced by the Republican Study Committee , conservatives who want to eliminate federal deficits faster than other Republicans , and are willing to back spending cuts that cause others to flinch .That gives rise to Pryor 's charge that Cotton supports increasing the age of eligibility for Social Security and Medicare . It 's unclear what sort of credence voters give to the charge .`` You hear that all the time , '' says James Wilkerson , 64 , tending the cash register at the Pickens Store and Restaurant , where Cotton mingled with a few dozen lunchtime patrons . `` I have n't seen any evidence of that . ''If voters are just getting to know Cotton , Pryor needs no introduction .The 51-year-old lawmaker has a family political bond with the voters reaching back decades . It was first forged by his father , former two-term governor and three-term Sen. David Pryor , who retired in 1996 and now campaigns with his wife , Barbara , for their son .She delivers a pep talk to the phone bank volunteers calling in search of new voters and sums up Democratic fears succinctly . `` Bad leaders are elected by good people who fail to vote , '' she says .Cotton has a different view , and Obama — not surprisingly — figures into it .`` Only in the last four or five years have the conservative values of Arkansas begun to move toward the Republican Party , '' he said in an interview . `` People like my parents , who were lifelong Democrats , realize that the Obama Democrats really do n't represent those conservative views and values .

PORTLAND Ore. ( Reuters ) - The state of Oregon sued Oracle America Inc. and six of its top executives Friday , accusing the software giant of fraud for failing to deliver a working website for the Affordable Care Act program .The 126-page lawsuit , filed in Marion County Circuit Court , claims that fraud , lying and `` a pattern of racketeering '' by Oracle cost the state and its Cover Oregon program hundreds of millions of dollars .`` Not only were Oracle 's claims lies , Oracle 's work was abysmal , '' the lawsuit said . Oregon paid Oracle about $ 240.3 million for a system that never worked , the suit said .Oracle issued a statement saying the suit `` is a desperate attempt to deflect blame from Cover Oregon and the governor for their failures to manage a complex IT project . The complaint is a fictional account of the Oregon Healthcare Project . ''The company said it expects to prevail in both the state court lawsuit and in a breach of contract suit it filed against Cover Oregon two weeks ago in federal court .Oregon was initially enthusiastic about the federal healthcare plan , commonly known as Obamacare . The state plan , called Cover Oregon , ran quirky , engaging television commercials and print ads in advance of the rollout .But , the Oracle-built site never worked and Oregonians were forced to submit paper applications in a hastily-organized process . In April Oregon moved to an exchange run by the federal government .The long-expected lawsuit bases some of its claims on information apparently given to the state by a former employee .The whistle-blower told the state that Oracle `` planned ... a behind the scenes effort '' to keep the state from hiring an outside systems integrator who would oversee the project .The suit asks Oracle to pay for Cover Oregon 's financial losses , plus penalties for damages .`` The complaint filed contains serious new allegations of fraud , deceit and corruption by Oracle , '' Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber , a former emergency room doctor , said in a statement .( Reporting by Teresa Carson in Portland ; Editing by Dan Whitcomb and Jim Loney )
PORTSMOUTH , New Hampshire — Former U.S . Senator Scott Brown of Massachusetts launched a Republican campaign on Thursday to represent neighboring New Hampshire in the Senate , with an attack on incumbent Democrat Jeanne Shaheen 's vote for Obamacare .Brown , who moved to his native New Hampshire late last year to explore a run for office , has focused much of his energy on attacking the Affordable Care Act , an issue Republicans are making a centerpiece of 2014 campaigns .`` So many problems with our economy happened because of Obamacare . And Obamacare could not have happened without a rubber-stamp 'yes ' vote from Senator Shaheen , '' Brown told a crowd of a couple hundred supporters in a hotel ballroom in Portsmouth , New Hampshire , near the state 's southern coast .`` Obamacare forces us to make a choice , live free or log on - and here in New Hampshire , we choose freedom , '' Brown said .The Affordable Care Act passed the U.S. Senate in 2010 by a margin of 60-39 , with all Democrats , including Shaheen , voting in favor of President Barack Obama 's top domestic priority .Technical glitches plagued the new system 's rollout . Obamacare is less popular in New Hampshire than nationally , according to February poll , which found 53 percent of adults in the state opposing the law and 34 percent favoring it .Despite the early problems , the White House released figures last week showing that 7.1 million people had enrolled through the new exchanges , exceeding most expectations .New Hampshire Democrats note that the state 's legislature recently voted to accept federal subsidies expanding the Medicaid health care program for the poor in New Hampshire , a move made possible by the Affordable Care Act .`` Scott Brown may find that what he thinks the public 's attitude here in New Hampshire is , may not be what he finds when he gets around the state because repealing the Affordable Care Act means repealing health care for 50,000 citizens , '' said New Hampshire statehouse Speaker Terie Norelli , a Democrat .Before any matchup with Shaheen , Brown faces a competitive Republican primary in September , with his leading rival Bob Smith , a conservative who is trying to reclaim a seat he held from 1990 to 2003 .GAINING GROUNDBrown has already won support from national Republican groups eager to reclaim a majority in the Senate , which Democrats currently control by 55 seats to the Republican 's 43 .Two polls of New Hampshire voters released on Thursday showed him gaining ground on Shaheen .Public Policy Polling found 49 percent of 1,034 New Hampshire voters would vote for Shaheen and 41 percent for Brown in a head-to-head matchup . Prior polls had given Shaheen , a former governor , a wider lead on Brown .A WMUR television poll , with a sample size of 387 likely voters found Shaheen with a narrower 45-39 lead .Brown 's strong anti-Obamacare stance drew divided reaction from New Hampshire voters .Bill Gannon , a 51-year-old theater-curtain business owner from Sundown , said he 'd become interested in Brown in part because of his anti-Obamacare message .`` I do n't like the new healthcare law , '' said Gannon , who had joined the crowd in the hotel ballroom to hear Brown speak . `` We need the Senate back and this is a guy who 's electable . ''Outside , 80-year-old Joan Webber of Kensington , New Hampshire , who was holding a sign reading `` Scott Brown is a twerp '' said he supported Shaheen and the Affordable Care Act .`` He probably has his insurance already , '' Webber said of Brown . `` He just does n't want the poor to get it .

POTOMAC , Md . — Working to fill campaign coffers for House Democrats , President Barack Obama poked fun at Republicans on Monday for placing an election-year focus on the deadly attacks in Benghazi , Libya , and his namesake health care law rather than on issues he deemed more serious .Standing between two flags in a white tent erected outside a supporter 's sprawling home , Obama pointed the finger at the GOP and charged his political opponents with employing an election strategy based around making Americans cynical , angry and suspicious enough that they vote for Republicans in the next election .`` The debate we 're having right now is about what , Benghazi ? Obamacare ? It becomes this endless loop , '' said an incredulous Obama . `` It 's not serious . It 's not speaking to the real concerns that people have . ''It was a rare moment where the president 's frustration with the GOP 's incessant focus on his political weaknesses bubbled to the surface .Republicans have spent recent weeks pummeling Obama and his administration over the 2012 attack in Libya that took place on Obama 's watch . For Obama , the renewed focus on Benghazi , where four Americans died , only replaces one headache with another ; until recently , Republicans had been laser-focused on pushing repeal of Obama 's unpopular health law as a way to score points with voters in November .It 's not true that Democrats are behaving as unreasonably as Republicans , Obama insisted , adding that the GOP has been `` captured '' by a group that 's unserious and ineffective .`` I hate to be blunt about it , but that 's the play , '' Obama told about 65 supporters who paid up to $ 32,400 per couple for a chance to have dinner with the president . Joining them were a list of bold-named Democratic figures , including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Maryland Gov . Martin O'Malley , who is considered a potential presidential candidate in 2016 .This is the fifth time Obama has made the money pitch for House Democrats this year — one of more than 20 fundraisers Obama has agreed to do through the summer for Democratic-aligned campaign groups .Democrats are anxiously working to protect their fragile majority in the Senate , and would need a net gain of 17 seats this year to seize the majority from Republicans . But a combination of Obama 's low approval ratings , an unfavorable electoral map and historical trends are all working against Democrats to dampen the party 's prospects in November .To that end , Obama was careful not to raise Democrats ' hopes too high . Rather than urging donors to pony up big so Democrats can win back control of the House , Obama offered a more modest goal:`` We 've got to make sure that Democrats are making progress this midterm , '' he said .___
PROVIDENCE , R.I. — President Obama on Friday promoted his proposals to raise wages and expand benefits for working women , making an election-season push to portray Republicans as stuck in the past and hindering an economic recovery .“We need Republicans in Congress to stop blocking a minimum-wage increase , ” Mr. Obama said at Rhode Island College , where he highlighted elements of his agenda aimed at helping women , including paid leave , pay equity and the health care law’s required insurance coverage for mammograms .“We’ve got to raise our voices , ” the president said , to “do away with policies and politicians that belong in a ‘Mad Men’ episode.” He was referring to the period television drama focusing on a male-dominated advertising agency in the 1960s .The speech came in the middle of a campaign swing Mr. Obama is making through Democratic strongholds in advance of next week’s elections , but it steered almost entirely clear of electoral politics .Instead , the president’s comments were carefully tailored to burnish his credentials and boost his party’s image with women , an influential voting bloc , without explicitly tying Democratic candidates to Mr. Obama . In one of his final appearances before the midterm congressional contests next Tuesday in which his party’s control of the Senate is at stake , the president never mentioned voting or the campaign .“This shouldn’t be partisan , ” he said at one point .Mr. Obama refrained from linking his agenda to the election or to Democratic candidates as he did earlier this month during an economic speech in Evanston , Ill. , in which he said his economic policies were “on the ballot” this fall even though he personally was not . That remark drew grumbling from some Democrats and party strategists who said it risked undermining candidates’ attempts to appeal to swing voters who are dissatisfied with Mr. Obama .Still , the president seized the opportunity on Friday to claim credit for fueling an economic recovery and making health care more affordable over the opposition of Republicans .“No matter how many times Republicans threaten to repeal this law , we’re going to keep it in place , ” Mr. Obama said of the Affordable Care Act , claiming vindication about its key provisions . “I’m pretty sure that , you know , in 10 years they’re not going to call it ‘Obamacare’ anymore . Republicans will be like , ‘Oh , I was for that.’ That’s how that works.”He also pointed to job gains that have taken hold during the past five years and a government report on Thursday showing the economy grew at an annualized rate of 3.5 percent in the third quarter .“If you care about these policies , you’ve got to keep pushing for them , ” Mr. Obama said .It was an economic message in stark contrast to the president’s surroundings — a state whose unemployment rate is among the nation’s highest , where Gina Raimondo , the Democrat running for governor , speaks often of how the state has been left behind the rest of the nation’s recovery .“We really are in a jobs crisis , ” Ms. Raimondo said in a brief interview before Mr. Obama’s speech , noting that Rhode Island’s unemployment rate is 7.6 percent , much higher than the 5.9 percent national average . In Providence , the state capital where the president appeared , the rate is 10 percent . “My whole campaign is just pounding that message , ” she said .Of the economic rebound Mr. Obama so often mentions , Ms. Raimondo said , “We just haven’t felt it here.”The speech came in the middle of a five-state campaign tour Mr. Obama has been making to boost Democratic candidates for governor , with stops planned for Saturday in Detroit and on Sunday in Bridgeport , Conn. , and Philadelphia . In the races’ final days , the president is staying out of the most important battleground states , although he is tracking the races from afar .
Perceptions about health reform are in an interesting place . Just about everyone on the right is still living in October , the annus horribilis of Obamacare ( yes , I know it was just a month , and I don’t care ) , and is waiting to move in for the kill after the whole thing collapses . Meanwhile , a funny thing has been happening : enrollments surged this month , to such an extent that the original expectation of 7 million people signed up via the exchanges by the end of March no longer looks crazy .OK , the usual caveats : we don’t know how many of the people signing up via the exchanges are replacing existing policies , and we don’t know how much trouble there will be when people start trying to use their new insurance . On the other hand , we know that there are a substantial number of people buying ACA-compliant policies directly from insurers , who don’t show up in the numbers yet .And while 7 million has become the number to match or beat , the truth is that it doesn’t matter too much if “only” 6 million sign up via the exchanges , plus millions more who are signed up under expanded Medicaid . Even a slightly disappointing first year will still offer enough people benefits to make reform politically irreversible .At this point , we have more than 2 million signed up via the exchanges and more than 4 million added to Medicaid . Both numbers will grow a lot over the next three months . This is pretty close to the end game .
Politics | If Tom Daschle succeeds in passing Obamacare , he might also kill conservatism , a columnist writes . He says look at the introduction of nationalized health care in Britain , which turned conservative-leaning workers into long-term believers in the Labor Party’s social safety net . “Blocking Obama’s health plan is key to the G.O.P.’s survival , ” says a libertarian analyst . [ U.S. News & World Report ]
President Obama is finally making a strong case for his own health reform , mocking Republicans for their obsession with denying insurance to 30 million Americans . It’s about time ; and many of us still feel that he did a remarkably bad job of explaining the reform in the past .Still , Brian Beutler has a good point here : the long delay in implementation made Obamacare hard to campaign on , because people had no experience of how it works in practice . Republicans could tell all kinds of lies , promulgate all kinds of misconceptions , and if the law’s defenders tried to refute these claims , well , who was telling the truth ? Remember how Medicare was going to destroy American freedom ?But now the reality of Obamacare is just months away . It may have a rocky start , especially in red states where the local government is doing all it can to disrupt the implementation , but pretty soon many Americans will have first-hand knowledge of how the system really works . And if Massachusetts is any guide , they’re going to like it a lot .Hence Obama’s new confidence and the desperation of the GOP .
President Obama’s name won’t be on any ballots Tuesday , but he will most certainly be on them in spirit — a fact that many Republicans are trumpeting and some Democrats are hoping to downplay .The president is not particularly popular at the moment .According to Gallup’s Frank Newport:“President Obama’s job approval rating is 42 percent . If that holds up until the day before the election , it will be the second-lowest job approval rating for a president before a midterm election going back to 1982 when Ronald Reagan , of course , was president of the U.S. What was the lowest of all ? That was George W. Bush’s , whose job approval rating was 38 percent back in 2006.”On a host of issues , foreign and domestic , large and small — the rise and spread of the Islamic State , the Russian aggression into Ukraine , the federal response to the Ebola crisis in West Africa and the panic here , the crisis of children from Central America crossing our Southern border , the Internal Revenue Service , the Secret Service , Obamacare and , of course , Benghazi — conservatives have attacked . They have used each as yet another plank to construct their government-as-House-of-Horrors argument about a Washington that is mismanaged and out of touch , overreaching but outmatched .And in their propaganda , this idea of an ineffectual , and ultimately dangerous , government has a face : Obama’s . Republicans aren’t running on issues as much as running against an individual and an idea ; they are running against Obama and the very idea of federal government , except as defined by the most narrow of functions .Others believe that there is also something else at play , implicitly or explicitly : race . Last week NBC’s Chuck Todd asked Senator Mary Landrieu , the Louisiana Democrat locked in a tight re-election race , why President Obama has a hard time in her state . One of the reasons she gave was this : “I’ll be very , very honest with you . The South has not always been the friendliest place for African-Americans.”This is the great immeasurable when it comes to this man . Race is a construct that , unfortunately , is woven through the fabric of America . Of course , it has some bearing on our politics , but it’s nearly impossible to calculate the degree of the effect for a particular politician . And there can be benefit as well as detriment — pride and prejudice as counterweights .As Obama himself told The New Yorker in January : “There’s no doubt that there’s some folks who just really dislike me because they don’t like the idea of a black President.”He continued : “Now , the flip side of it is there are some black folks and maybe some white folks who really like me and give me the benefit of the doubt precisely because I’m a black President.”As Gallup pointed out last week : “We find very little change in the support given to Obama among his strongest demographic subgroup : black Americans.” The report continued , “In fact , if anything , the trend is for relatively higher support among blacks” when measuring the gap between black support for Obama and the national average .The president is now playing to those black folks in a last-ditch effort to help Democrats maintain Senate control , even as much of the betting money is on the real possibility that Republicans will wrest control away .According to a New York Times analysis of voter data earlier this month : “African-Americans could help swing elections in Georgia , Louisiana , North Carolina and possibly Arkansas , ” but , the article says , “only if they turn out at higher-than-forecast rates.”So , the president has been making direct appeals to this group on black radio stations across the country . Obama’s appeals appear to be working , at least as measured by the composition of early-voting tallies . As The New York Times’s Nate Cohn pointed out last week in The Upshot:“The turnout among black voters is particularly encouraging for Democrats , who need strong black turnout to compete in racially polarized states like Georgia and North Carolina . In those two states , black voters so far represent 30 percent of the voters who did not participate in 2010 . By comparison , 24 percent of all those who voted in those states in 2010 were black.”Black support is particularly important this cycle since support among Hispanic voters is showing signs of weakening . A Washington Post/ABC News poll released last week “showed that , among Latinos , 50 percent say it doesn’t matter who wins the Senate come November . And among those who do think it will matter , twice as many say it would be a good thing ( 30 percent ) if the G.O.P . took over as say it would be a bad thing ( 15 percent ) .”It’s not clear whether President Obama can energize enough black voters to save Democratic control of the Senate , but he seems ever more reliant on this group to give him “the benefit of the doubt” and ride to his rescue .
Previously on the Minute : Rescuing a Stranded Ship
RACINE , Wis. – Rick Santorum urged Republicans here Sunday evening to carefully study the record of Mitt Romney , declaring : “He is the worst Republican in the country to put up against Barack Obama.”At the final campaign rally of a weekend trip to Wisconsin , Mr. Santorum sharpened the tenor of his argument against Mr. Romney during an appearance here at the South Hills Country Club . He offered a litany of reasons for why he said he believed Mr. Romney presented a weak contrast to Mr. Obama , particularly on health care .“Pick any other Republican in the country , ” Mr. Santorum told supporters here . “He is the worst Republican in the country to put up against Barack Obama . Why would Wisconsin want to vote for someone like that ? ”Mr. Santorum , who was criticized by Republicans last week after suggesting that there was little difference between electing Mr. Obama or Mr. Romney , grew angry after his speech when asked to expound on his comment about Mr. Romney being the “worst Republican.”“What speech did you listen to ? ” Mr. Santorum told The New York Times , speaking in a terse and agitated tone . “I said he was the worst Republican to run on the issue of Obamacare . That’s what I was talking about.”Mr. Santorum , as he signed autographs along a rope line , continued to raise his voice and suggested the media had been “distorting my words.” He used an expletive to make his point , saying again that it was Mr. Romney’s health care record – not his positions in general – that make him the “worst Republican” to run against Mr. Obama .“On the issue of health care , yes , that’s what I was talking about , ” Mr. Santorum later told reporters . “Obamacare , as you heard me say.”
RALEIGH , N.C. — North Carolina Democratic Sen.

RICHMOND , Virginia — U.S . Senator Mark Warner holds a 15-point lead among Virginia voters over Republican challenger Ed Gillespie , but the Democrat 's support for Obamacare could cost him votes in the November election , according to a poll released on Thursday .Warner is favored by 46 percent of voters as he seeks a second term , compared with 31 percent for Gillespie , a former chairman of the Republican National Committee , according to the Quinnipiac University survey . Libertarian Robert Sarvis has 6 percent backing .Warner voted in 2010 for the Affordable Care Act , or President Barack Obama 's signature healthcare reform , which has had a troubled launch . Virginia voters oppose the healthcare law 52 percent to 44 percent , the poll showed .Voters in Virginia , a swing state in presidential elections , said 45 percent to 31 percent that they were less likely to vote for a Senate candidate who supported the health care law .Warner has said that he was upset by the difficult roll-out of the Affordable Care Act . He has urged supporters and opponents of the legislation to work together to solve its problems .Gillespie , a former Washington lobbyist and counselor to Republican President George W. Bush , opposes the Affordable Care Act .Warner is among the third of the 100-member Senate up for election in November . Republicans believe they have a good chance to pick up the six seats they need to take control of the Senate based on public dissatisfaction with Obama and concerns about Obamacare .Democrats are defending 21 seats , including Warner 's , to 14 for Republicans .Voters say 33 percent to 15 percent they would be less likely to vote for Warner if Obama campaigned for him , the poll showed .Peter Brown , assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll , said Warner enjoyed high name recognition and a strong job approval rating , at 55 percent .He is in the range that suggests that an incumbent is a heavy favorite for re-election , Brown said in a statement accompanying the poll .Gillespie , who has never held elective office , still has to introduce himself to Virginia voters , though his background in national politics will help him raise money , Brown said .The poll of 1,288 voters was conducted March 19 to 24 and has a margin of error of 2.7 percentage points .( Editing by Ian Simpson and Stephen Powell )
Remember all the pundits who stroked their chins , pretended to deliberate , then — completely predictably — came out against health care reform because , they said , it wouldn’t control health care costs ? Remember all the demands that Obama do something real , like raising the Medicare age ( which turns out not to make any significant difference to the deficit ) ?Now , from the CEA , we have this:The CEA is careful not to claim too much — there’s pretty good evidence that the ACA has played an important role in the cost slowdown , but they don’t assign any particular number . Still , it looks as if the biggest complaint against Obamacare was completely wrong : cost control is one of the things that is really , really working , with huge positive fiscal implications .If they get the enrollment process working — it’s getting better , but we still don’t know if it’s moving fast enough — this is still going to go down in the long run as a policy triumph .

Remember the “death tax” ? The estate tax is quite literally a millionaire’s tax — a tax that affects only a tiny minority of the population , and is mostly paid by a handful of very wealthy heirs . Nonetheless , right-wingers have successfully convinced many voters that the tax is a cruel burden on ordinary Americans — that all across the nation small businesses and family farms are being broken up to pay crushing estate tax liabilities .You might think that such heart-wrenching cases are actually quite rare , but you’d be wrong : they aren’t rare ; they’re nonexistent . In particular , nobody has ever come up with a real modern example of a family farm sold to meet estate taxes . The whole “death tax” campaign has rested on eliciting human sympathy for purely imaginary victims .And now they’re trying a similar campaign against health reform .I’m not sure whether conservatives realize yet that their Plan A on health reform — wait for Obamacare’s inevitable collapse , and reap the political rewards — isn’t working . But it isn’t . Enrollments have recovered strongly from the law’s disastrous start-up ; in California , which had a working website from the beginning , enrollment has already exceeded first-year projections . The mix of people signed up so far is older than planners had hoped , but not enough so to cause big premium hikes , let alone the often-predicted “death spiral.”And conservatives don’t really have a Plan B — in their world , nobody even dares mention the possibility that health reform might actually prove workable . Still , you can already see some on the right groping toward a new strategy , one that relies on highlighting examples of the terrible harm Obamacare does . There’s only one problem : they haven’t managed to come up with any real examples . Consider several recent ventures on the right:■ In the official G.O.P . response to the State of the Union address , Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers alluded to the case of “Bette in Spokane , ” who supposedly lost her good health insurance coverage and was forced to pay nearly $ 700 more a month in premiums . Local reporters located the real Bette , and found that the story was completely misleading : her original policy provided very little protection , and she could get a much better plan for much less than the claimed cost .■ In Louisiana , the AstroTurf ( fake grass-roots ) group Americans for Prosperity — the group appears to be largely financed and controlled by the Koch brothers and other wealthy donors — has been running ads targeting Senator Mary Landrieu . In these ads , we see what appear to be ordinary Louisiana residents receiving notices telling them that their insurance policies have been canceled because of Obamacare . But the people in the ads are , in fact , paid actors , and the scenes they play aren’t re-enactments of real events — they’re “emblematic , ” says a spokesman for the group .■ In Michigan , Americans for Prosperity is running an ad that does feature a real person . But is she telling a real story ? In the ad , Julia Boonstra , who is suffering from leukemia , declares that her insurance has been canceled , that the new policy will have unaffordable out-of-pocket costs , and that “If I do not receive my medication , I will die.” But Glenn Kessler of The Washington Post tried to check the facts , and learned that thanks to lower premiums she will almost surely save nearly as much if not more than she will be paying in higher out-of-pocket costs . A spokesman for Americans for Prosperity responded to questions about the numbers with bluster and double-talk — this is about “a real person suffering from blood cancer , not some neat and tidy White House PowerPoint.”Even supporters of health reform are somewhat surprised by the right’s apparent inability to come up with real cases of hardship . Surely there must be some people somewhere actually being hurt by a reform that affects millions of Americans . Why can’t the right find these people and exploit them ?The most likely answer is that the true losers from Obamacare generally aren’t very sympathetic . For the most part , they’re either very affluent people affected by the special taxes that help finance reform , or at least moderately well-off young men in very good health who can no longer buy cheap , minimalist plans . Neither group would play well in tear-jerker ads .No , what the right wants are struggling average Americans , preferably women , facing financial devastation from health reform . So those are the tales they’re telling , even though they haven’t been able to come up with any real examples .Hey , I have a suggestion : Why not have ads in which actors play Americans who have both lost their insurance thanks to Obamacare and lost the family farm to the death tax ? I mean , once you’re just making stuff up , anything goes .
Representative Aaron Schock is a conservative Republican from Illinois , but not conservative enough for the hard-right activist group Club for Growth , which is seeking someone to run against him in next yearâs primary .His crime ? In 2011 , he voted to increase the debt ceiling , and , in 2012 , he voted for a stopgap spending bill that prevented a government shutdown . In neither case did he demand the defunding of health care reform .Club for Growth and other extremist groups consider a record like his an unforgivable failure , and they are raising and spending millions to make sure that no Republicans will take similar positions in the next few weeks when the fiscal year ends and the debt limit expires .If youâre wondering why so many House Republicans seem to believe they can force President Obama to accept a âdefundingâ of the health care reform law by threatening a government shutdown or a default , itâs because these groups have promised to inflict political pain on any Republican official who doesnât go along .Heritage Action and the Senate Conservatives Fund have each released scorecards showing which lawmakers have pledged to âdefund Obamacare.â When a senator like Tom Coburn of Oklahoma refuses to pledge , right-wing activists are told : âPlease contact Senator Coburn and tell him itâs dishonest to say you oppose Obamacare , but then vote to fund it . Tell him he swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution.âMr. Schock and 10 other lawmakers considered suspiciously squishy by the Club for Growth were designated as RINOâs ( Republicans in name only ) , and the club has vowed to find primary opponents and support them with cash â a formidable threat considering that it spent $ 18 million backing conservative candidates in the 2012 cycle . Americans for Prosperity , a Koch brothers group that has already spent millions on ads fighting health reform , is beginning a new campaign to delay the lawâs effects .These groups , all financed with secret and unlimited money , feed on chaos and would like nothing better than to claim credit for pushing Washington into another crisis . Winning an ideological victory is far more important to them than the severe economic effects of a shutdown or , worse , a default , which could shatter the credit markets .They also have another reason for their attacks : fund-raising . All their Web sites pushing the defunding scheme include a big âdonateâ button for the faithful to push . âWith your donation , you will be sending a strong message : Obamacare must be defunded now , â says the Web site of the National Liberty Federation , another âsocial welfareâ group that sees dollar signs in shutting down the government .Brian Walsh , a longtime Republican operative , recently noted in U.S. News and World Report that the right is now spending more money attacking Republicans than the Democrats are . âMoney begets TV ads , which begets even more money for these groupsâ personal coffers , â he wrote . âPointing fingers and attacking Republicans is apparently a very profitable fund-raising business.âIt may be good for their bank accounts , but the combination of unlimited money and rigid ideology is proving toxic for the most basic functioning of government .
Representative Tom Cotton spoke President Obama’s name far more often than he mentioned his opponent , the Democratic incumbent , Mark Pryor , in the first half-hour of their debate tonight .In one five-minute period , Mr. Cotton said Obama or Obamacare 15 times and , among other things , blamed the Affordable Care Act for the rise in student loan rates and Mr. Pryor for increased tuition at the University of Arkansas .When it was Mr. Pryor’s turn , he sought to score points by pointing out four times in one answer that Mr. Cotton attended Harvard . “He probably couldn’t get into the University of Arkansas , ” the senator joked , before growing more serious . “He uses Harvard to pursue his political career.”
Republican candidates are falling madly in love with contraception .Who knew ?“I believe the pill ought to be available over the counter , round the clock , without a prescription — cheaper and easier , for you , ” declares Colorado Senate candidate Cory Gardner in a new ad . He’s running against the Democratic incumbent , Mark Udall , in a close race .Meanwhile , in North Carolina , during a Senate debate this week , Republican Thom Tillis announced that he , too , strongly believed “over-the-counter oral contraception should be available without a prescription.”Tillis , a longtime politician , had never mentioned this big idea before . Until the debate , his most famous collision with women’s reproductive rights came when , as speaker of the State House , he allowed the Republican majority to add a last-minute amendment to a bill on motorcycle safety reducing access to abortions .So big surprise from Thom Tillis . The same thing , more or less , has happened in Senate races in Virginia and Minnesota . Republicans in close elections suddenly turn into cheerleaders for over-the-counter birth control pills . A negative and suspicious mind might almost suspect they were following a script .During one recent U.S. House debate in Colorado , the Republican incumbent , Mike Coffman , said in an answer to a moderator’s question that he was pro-life , then quickly added : “But I support a woman’s access to ... to , uh ...“Um , certainly to this Hobby Lobby decision , to get ... ”Painful moments of groping , flailing . What the heck do you call that stuff ? Finally , a merciful member of the audience shouted : “Birth control.”“Birth control ! ” cried Coffman with relief .We’re entering another election season in which women’s issues loom large . ( In North Carolina , one recent poll showed the gender gap between Tillis and his Democratic opponent , Senator Kay Hagan , is 32 percent . ) The Republicans are trying to avoid the disastrous tone-deafness that cropped up two years ago when a leading Senate candidate suggested that a gal could not get pregnant if she was raped . This season , Democrats have been eagerly looking for similar fodder . So far , there’s been nothing quite that awful , although it’s pretty clear there are folks who still haven’t gotten with the program . Male invitees to an event for Florida Congressman Steve Southerland were told to “tell the misses not to wait up” because “the after-dinner whiskey and cigars will be smooth & the issues to discuss are many.”A spokesman for Southerland indignantly told BuzzFeed , which first obtained the invitation , that “rather than focusing on nonsense stories , ” reporters should be asking Southerland’s opponent about Obamacare . Truly , there is nothing that can not be dismissed by bringing up the Affordable Care Act . Total miracle that the ex-governor of Virginia chose to defend himself against corruption charges by claiming his wife was a terrible person when he could just as easily have argued that taking money from a dietary supplement salesman was not nearly as bad as Obamacare .I digress . About the pill . There was a time when the Republican Party championed family planning and access to contraception . But that was , you know , before disco . Now it’s a rare Republican candidate who can latch onto a major nomination without calling for an end to abortion rights and the defunding of Planned Parenthood . Many of them have also signed on to the personhood movement , which wants to provide legal rights to every fertilized egg in the country . This idea , with its potential impact on access to birth control , is so unpopular that it failed by a landslide in Mississippi .All this can create problems for the women’s vote in general elections . In Colorado , the Democrats have pointed out endlessly that Cory Gardner supported personhood amendments to the State Constitution . After he seemed to be losing ground , Gardner said that when personhood came up in 2008 and 2010 he did not really understand the possible consequences . ( “This was a bad idea driven by good intentions.” )Now think about this for a minute . Imagine you’re a politician in a state that’s considering an amendment to the state constitution that is very controversial and all about women’s reproduction . Pretend it’s on the ballot the same time when you’re running for Congress . Pretend you’re very , very concerned with women’s access to contraception .At what point would you say to yourself : “Wow , I wonder if this could have any impact on birth control ? ” Choose from the following:A ) First time the subject came up .B ) Not actually until a week before the election because it was a tough year and I had home repair issues to deal with .C ) Some undetermined point between the day the amendment failed by 3 to 1 and , um , right this minute .Yes ! In Gardner’s case the answer is C .In every election , voters ask the candidates : “What have you done for me lately ? ” In this case , we might also want to know what they were doing last year .
Republicans are doing their best to persuade Americans that the Affordable Care Act will drive health insurance premiums so high that consumers will experience ârate shock.â That fear-provoking tale seems much less credible now that the rates proposed by health insurers for individual coverage on the new health care exchanges have been made public in several states . For the most part , the premiums will increase only slightly or even decrease for individuals and family coverage on the exchanges , electronic marketplaces in which consumers choose among a variety of plans with differing benefits and costs .The reported rates are in states that have elected to run their own exchanges , which are set to start enrolling people in October for coverage that begins in January 2014 . Many states with Republican governors have refused to set up exchanges and have left that task to the Obama administration . In 19 states where the exchanges will be entirely run by the federal government , more health insurance companies are entering the markets and injecting competition that should help hold down costs , the administration said on Thursday . Premiums are subject to many competing pressures , but , in several states , competition appears to be offsetting factors that might push rates up .In California , officials announced last week that 13 insurers were awarded contracts to sell policies on the stateâs health care exchanges next year . The companies submitted bids , which came in much lower than virtually all experts and actuaries had forecast .Blue Shield of California said that its premiums for individual customers would increase about 13 percent on average next year over current premiums ; about 8 percent of that increase would the cover rising cost of medical care , which would have happened anyway . The other 5 percent pays for better benefits , guaranteed coverage for pre-existing conditions , and taxes and fees imposed on insurers by the reform law .About 2.6 million people in California are likely to be eligible for federal subsidies on the exchanges based on their incomes , which will lower the costs they have to pay , in some cases substantially . Californiaâs success lies in aggressive negotiations by officials of the independent state agency running the exchanges with the health plans to keep insurance bids low . That led some insurance companies , in turn , to bargain down the prices charged by hospitals and doctors to care for their enrollees .Similar good news came from an analysis of five other states â Maryland , Oregon , Rhode Island , Vermont and Washington . A Democratic Congressional staff analysis issued last week found no evidence of widespread ârate shockâ and considerable evidence that consumers will benefit from better coverage at lower cost . In Oregon and Washington , the analysis found , consumers who want to remain with their current insurer could get comparable coverage next year for less than they are currently paying . Consumers can save even more by looking for cheaper policies on the exchanges .The big challenge in all states will be to get people enrolled in coverage . California , where Democrats control the state government , is expected to mount a strong effort to sign up people . Republicans in Congress , however , are doing their best to block money needed for outreach programs . Private groups will need to help pick up the slack .
Republicans have been focusing on the messiness of the Obamacare rollout , and that’s perfectly legitimate . It has been very messy . Some liberals think they shouldn’t acknowledge the problems , because that just gives the critics more talking points . I disagree : The rollout has been a disaster , and President Obama was misleading when he said everyone could keep their existing insurance . Let’s not disguise the truth .But as Republicans segue to the broader issue of health care reform and try to re-litigate Obamacare itself , it’s also worth remembering that the United States has a poorly performing and highly expensive health care system that desperately needs broader access–and that’s just what Obamacare does , albeit not very elegantly .It’s important to talk about studies showing that the United States has shorter life expectancy and higher infant mortality than other industrialized countries , but it also helps to put a human face on the problem . That’s what I do in my Sunday column . I’d welcome your comments .
Republicans would like the country to believe that they took control of the Senate on Tuesday by advocating a strong , appealing agenda of job creation , tax reform and spending cuts . But , in reality , they did nothing of the sort .Even the voters who supported Republican candidates would have a hard time explaining what their choices are going to do . That’s because virtually every Republican candidate campaigned on only one thing : what they called the failure of President Obama . In speech after speech , ad after ad , they relentlessly linked their Democratic opponent to the president and vowed that they would put an end to everything they say the public hates about his administration . On Tuesday morning , the Republican National Committee released a series of get-out-the-vote images showing Mr. Obama and Democratic Senate candidates next to this message : “If you’re not a voter , you can’t stop Obama.”The most important promises that winning Republicans made were negative in nature . They will repeal health care reform . They will roll back new regulations on banks and Wall Street . They will stop the Obama administration’s plans to curb coal emissions and reform immigration and invest in education .Campaigning on pure negativity isn’t surprising for a party that has governed that way since Mr. Obama was first sworn in . By creating an environment where every initiative is opposed and nothing gets done , Republicans helped engineer the president’s image as weak and ineffectual . Mitch McConnell , who will be the Senate’s new majority leader , vowed in 2009 to create “an inventory of losses” to damage Mr. Obama for precisely the results achieved on Tuesday .Mr. McConnell was assisted in this goal by the president’s own second-term stumbles — most notably the disastrous rollout of the Affordable Care Act last year , an indecisive foreign policy , and revelations of domestic surveillance and improper veterans care . Republicans were also able to exploit nativist fears about immigrant children crossing at the southern border and some initial troubles in responding to the first domestic cases of Ebola .In some races , missteps by the Democrats helped Republicans . In Iowa , Representative Bruce Braley may have cost himself the race by making a belittling comment about farmers . In Kentucky , Alison Lundergan Grimes didn’t establish a reputation for candor when she refused to discuss her previous votes for president .Virtually all Democratic candidates distanced themselves from Mr. Obama and refused to make the case that there has been substantial progress on jobs and economic growth under this administration .But Republicans also had little to say about reviving the economy , and their idea of creating jobs seems to be limited to building the Keystone XL oil pipeline , cutting taxes further and crying “repeal Obamacare” at every opportunity .In theory , full control of Congress might give Republicans an incentive to reach compromise with Mr. Obama because they will need to show that they can govern rather than obstruct . They might , for example , be able to find agreement on a free-trade agreement with Pacific nations .But their caucuses in the Senate and the House will be more conservative than before , and many winning candidates will feel obliged to live up to their promises of obstruction . Mr. McConnell has already committed himself to opposing a minimum-wage increase , fighting regulations on carbon emissions and repealing the health law .“Just because we have a two-party system doesn’t mean we have to be in perpetual conflict , ” Mr. McConnell said in his victory speech . As the new Senate leader , he must now prove those are not empty words .
Responding to my weekend column , which gently pushed back against the sudden burst of liberal optimism about HealthCare.Gov , Ezra Klein gently pushes back against my point that Obamacare’s quest to enroll the young and healthy faces bigger hurdles than did its model , Romneycare , in Massachusetts:Medicare Part D is left off this list , as often happens . But it’s the more direct comparison . It , too , was a polarizing national law that suffered from a terrible rollout . At launch , it was less popular even than Obamacare . In May 2006 — so , five months after its launch — a CBS/New York Times poll found 48 percent of seniors said they didn’t plan to join and 81 percent said the George W. Bush administration should extend the deadlines . A Gallup poll from about the same time showed 53 percent of seniors thought the law flatly wasn’t working .But the program didn’t fail . Mark McClellan , who led the rollout effort , recalls that “by the spring of 2006 most seniors signed up . Every senior had heard about this program or knew people in it . And everyone was familiar with the delayed enrollment penalty . Those things together led to a big bump before open enrollment ended.” Today Medicare Part D is widely considered a success . Over 90 percent of seniors say they’re happy with it .It’s true that the Medicare Part D analogy gets cited by Obamacare defenders more often than by the new health care law’s skeptics . Sometimes Part D’s example is invoked to criticize Republicans for their continued obstructionism ( because after all Democrats mostly voted against the prescription drug benefit , but didn’t throw up endless roadblocks to its implementation ) , and sometimes , as in this instance , to cite a happy case where a health care law with a faulty website and flawed rollout ended up becoming pretty popular . But both comparisons have always seemed flawed to me , for the following interrelated reasons:1 ) Medicare Part D faced political opposition , but not intense ideological resistance . The bill wasn’t a conservative pet project or the fulfillment of a long-running right-wing dream ; rather it was an attempt at centrist co-option by the Bush administration , which his base swallowed because it seemed politically necessary . Meanwhile , Democrats who opposed the legislation mostly did so not not because they hated the concept , but because they wanted a more generous , more socialized bill — which is to say , they were taking the position vis-a-vis Part D that their party’s leftward fringe took vis-a-vis Obamacare — and because they didn’t want to let Bush get the credit on an issue they felt they owned . It’s not surprising , then , that even when the law was unpopular it didn’t generate resistance and create high ideological drama — that there was no “repeal Part D” movement on the left in 2004 or 2006 or 2008 , no liberal equivalent of Ted Cruz trying to leverage the issue for his own ambitions , no talk about how the entire conservative project was on the line when the website wasn’t working . Whatever their objections to the form it took , Democrats explicitly wanted something like Part D , which meant that even during its flawed rollout there was an implicit bipartisan , pan-ideological consensus around the program that has never existed around Obamacare .2 ) Medicare Part D did not depend on the same kind of mandate-regulate-subsidize model as Romneycare and Obamacare — not least because it was a more narrowly-focused program than either — which meant that its architects had less reason to fear a “death spiral” during the initial period of bureaucratic chaos . Yes , Part D imposed a “delayed enrollment penalty , ” as Klein notes , on seniors who signed up for Medicare when they turned 65 but then waited for years to sign up for the prescription drug benefit . But there was no requirement that seniors sign up , no annual penalty for waiting , and neither the premiums nor the fine were nearly as central to the law’s design as the individual mandate is to Obamacare . What’s more …3 ) Signing up for Medicare Part D was vastly cheaper than signing up for Obamacare . Was , and is : Today the average Part D monthly premium is just $ 31 , while the average premium for a health insurance plan on the national exchange is about ten times that much . If the average Obamacare plan cost just a few hundred dollars a year to enroll , the short-term financial case for signing up would be much stronger , and the dangers of adverse selection much lower . It’s because the new law’s plans cost thousands of dollars , potentially , that there’s a serious risk that precisely the people the law needs to sign up will choose to remain uninsured . And because of that price differential , the example of Medicare Part D’s eventual enrollment success doesn’t necessarily tell us all that much about what the Obamacare pool will look like a year or five years hence .The point of elaborating these three differences , incidentally , is not to argue that Part D was brilliant legislation , and Obamacare is necessarily doomed . The two programs do have significant elements in common , some of their differences redound to Obamacare’s credit ( Part D rather famously didn’t even try to be deficit neutral , a standard the new health care law at least attempts to meet ) , and some of their similarities could be folded into a case that Obamacare could work out better than its doubters expect . ( There were reasons to think that Part D would also come in way over budget ; instead , it beat expectations , and the slowdown in health care costs that liberals are now suddenly crediting to Obamacare actually kicked off around the time Part D passed . )But when it comes to the specific question of whether Obamacare is going to have trouble meeting its young-and-healthy quota , I’m just not sure Medicare Part D has that much to teach us . That program was less polarizing and less furiously opposed , it cost far less to join , and it wasn’t built around the same kind of cross-subsidization model as the Affordable Care Act . It had a rocky rollout , just as Obamacare has had a rocky rollout . But what it needed to recover was not identical to what the new law needs now , and over the next few years , to be reasonably considered a success .
Returning from his Hawaiian vacation on Air Force One overnight , President Obama offered a brief assessment of the Republicans who will return to Washington Wednesday , saying that he expects Republicans to “play to their base for a certain period of time.”But Mr. Obama said he believes the Republicans in the Senate and the new leadership in the House will eventually play down politics in 2011 to focus on improving the nation’s economy .“My expectation , my hope is that John Boehner and Mitch McConnell will realize that there will be plenty of time to campaign for 2012 in 2012 , ” Mr. Obama told reporters . “And that our job this year is to make sure that we build on recovery . We started making good progress on that in the lame-duck , and I expect to build on that progress when I get back.”That may be more hope than expectation . Even as Mr. Obama boarded his plane to head home , Mr. Boehner who will be installed as speaker of the House on Wednesday , sent a very clear and precise signal to his base : I’m with you .Days before officially assuming power , Mr. Boehner began the process necessary to vote on the health care repeal . By posting the proposed repeal legislation online Monday night , Mr. Boehner’s Republican-controlled House said they could take a final vote on repeal next week .“BREAKING , ” said a Twitter message sent out by Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia , the new majority leader . “House # GOP to move this week on # ObamaCare repeal.”The message included the subject hashtag “ # teaparty , ” an overt acknowledgement of the intended recipients .Mr. Boehner’s Republicans are moving methodically to begin their control of the House with a series of mostly symbolic gestures aimed at the Tea Party conservatives who helped them seize control of the chamber last November .Republicans in the House also will have the entire Constitution read aloud from the floor of the chamber . The move is a shout-out to the new Tea Party lawmakers , who have argued that Washington has strayed too far from the intentions of the Constitution’s authors .And shortly after that , Republicans in the House will vote on legislation to cut the office budgets of House members and committees by five percent . The move , which will save a tiny $ 35 million or so , is a symbol of the party’s intent to control spending , Republicans said .But it is the health care vote , which is scheduled for January 12 , will set the tone for the opening of the 112th congress .“Obamacare is a job killer for businesses small and large , and the top priority for House Republicans is going to be to cut spending and grow the economy and jobs , ” Brad Dayspring , a spokesman for Mr. Cantor , said in a statement . “Further , Obamacare failed to lower costs as the president promised that it would and does not allow people to keep the care they currently have if they like it . That is why the House will repeal it next week.”Brad Woodhouse , a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee , said Republicans “are going to ram through a bill over the objections of millions of Americans to deny people access to affordable health care.”Mr. Woodhouse added : “This from a party that complained bitterly that Democrats rushed through health care reform after a year of debate and dozens of Congressional hearings.”Aboard Air Force One , the president declined to answer a reporter’s question about the move by House Republicans to try and repeal the health care legislation passed last year .Asked specifically what he thinks of GOP plans to repeal health care , the president paused but began to back out of the press cabin and didn’t answer .“Alright , guys , ” he said , adding : “Thank you , guys . Happy New Year.”
Rick Santorum , the former Pennsylvania senator who has called himself the “consistent conservative , ” released his first campaign ad that directly attacks Mitt Romney .The 30-second ad , “Easy Answer , ” which will begin running on Wednesday throughout South Carolina , tries to link Mitt Romney’s record to President Obama’s policies on bailouts , health care and social issues .“Obama supported the Wall Street bailouts , so did Romney , ” says a male narrator . “Obama gave us radical Obamacare that was based on Romneycare . Obama’s a liberal on social issues . Romney once bragged he’s even more liberal than Ted Kennedy on social issues.”The ad juxtaposes headshots of the two men against a blue background , and asks , “Why would we ever vote for someone who’s just like Obama ? When we can unite around Rick Santorum and beat Obama.”While this ad is a direct hit on Mr. Romney’s record , it makes no mention of Newt Gingrich , his main rival for the Christian conservative vote in South Carolina .
SACRAMENTO , California — Julie Davis has every reason to be skeptical of Obamacare : She 's a Republican , her father is a physician who is wary of socialized medicine and her insurance was canceled because of new requirements imposed by the healthcare law this year .But the 44-year-old filmmaker says her decision to seek coverage under President Barack Obama 's healthcare reform was a practical one , made with little political angst but plenty of doubt over whether the program will really benefit her family .`` I did approach it with a skeptical eye , '' said Davis , who lives in Los Angeles with her husband and son . `` But it 's not political . We have no choice . ''After several weeks researching the new health plans , Davis signed up for a mid-tier `` silver '' plan for the three family members at $ 930 a month , slightly more than their previous policy purchased on the individual market , but with a far lower deductible .Davis 's choice underscores the disconnect between Washington politics - particularly the Republican Party 's push to kill Obama 's Affordable Care Act and portray the law as an ill-devised social program bound to fail - and the experiences of at least some rank-and-file party members who are finding practical reasons to sign up . The discrepancy may complicate GOP efforts to use voter dissatisfaction over Obamacare 's troubled launch to win control of the Senate in November .The sharply polarized national argument over the U.S. healthcare system does not line up neatly with the needs of American households . Consumers opposed to the law may find a better deal under Obamacare , which offers subsidized coverage to lower-income households , bars insurers from excluding people on the basis of prior illness and mandates full coverage of common preventive health services . At the same time , some of the law 's supporters may also have lost health insurance policies they liked or encounter higher prices for their coverage .For some , the journey to Obamacare has been uncomfortable and even wrenching .`` It 's like part of my identity got stolen , '' said Clint Murphy , a longtime Georgia Republican political adviser and consultant to candidates who left the party , in large part over Obamacare . Murphy , 38 , worked on the 2008 presidential campaign of Arizona Senator John McCain and helped Georgia 's Karen Handel run for governor in 2010 .`` I was working for Karen during the full throttle of the healthcare debate , '' Murphy said , helping to position the candidate and attending events where speakers said Obamacare was going to `` steal your doctors away . ''Then , Murphy said , his mother developed brain cancer . The family spent more than $ 100,000 on services that were not covered by the government 's Medicare program for the elderly . At the same time , Murphy applied for insurance for himself and was denied for having sleep apnea and taking anti-anxiety medication .The Affordable Care Act , he said , will provide him with a policy for between $ 245 and $ 400 per month that covers his needs .Maggie Fernandez , 37 , lost her health coverage when she was laid off from a job with Miami County earlier this year . She has started a small consulting firm but has n't been able to afford individual market insurance premiums of $ 900 per month . She stopped taking her blood pressure medication , saying it was too expensive at $ 130 for a 30-day supply .In December , she enrolled in a silver plan that costs $ 315 per month through the federal HealthCare.gov website serving 36 states , many of which are led by Republicans who refused to set up their own Obamacare marketplaces . Her medications now cost $ 4 apiece each month .Some of her conservative friends have a hard time understanding why she signed up . Fernandez said she is a pragmatist who believes that everyone should have access to health insurance .`` There 's this perception that those who are going to sign up for Obamacare are poor , that they are leeches who are just trying to get free stuff from the government , '' she said . `` I am a law-abiding citizen who pays my taxes ... pays my mortgage and opened my own business . I 'm not looking for a freebie . ''PERSONAL POLITICSIt 's far too early to know how many Republican families are signing up for coverage under Obamacare . The new health insurance marketplaces are n't inquiring about party affiliation , and outreach workers are careful not to ask when they go into communities to explain how the program works .Nationwide , just over 2 million people have picked or paid for an Obamacare health plan in the first three months of enrollment , which lasts until the end of March , according to government data . The Obama administration hopes to sign up as many as 7 million people by the time enrollment closes .A Reuters/Ipsos poll shows only a small minority of respondents who identified themselves as Republican voters favor the healthcare law , about 11 percent . Among Republican voters who are candidates for buying health insurance on the Obamacare exchanges , some 17 percent say they are likely to sign up .Their experience with the program , good or bad , is likely to temper their politics over time , an influence already seen with government programs like Medicare for the elderly and Social Security , said Robert Blendon , a health policy expert at Harvard University .If Obamacare proves positive for enough Republicans , voters may decline to support candidates who vehemently oppose the program , or split their votes in other ways .`` Your willingness to split your ballot , your willingness to write a check to somebody who thinks the bill is really awful - that is going to change , '' Blendon said . `` If the story works out differently , it could go the other way . ''Of course , many who oppose the law wo n't sign up , regardless of whether it would benefit them .`` I really do n't need it or want it right now , '' said David Petersen , 52 , a registered Republican in Walla Walla , Washington . A construction manager who has gone without insurance for years , Petersen could purchase insurance on his state 's exchange for about $ 200 a month .People who decline to purchase insurance risk a fine of $ 95 or 1 percent of their income . Knowing that , Petersen did go online and search for a plan . But he decided , in the end , that he 'd rather risk the fine .Cheryl Mooney would qualify for a subsidy that would reduce the price of a policy for herself and her husband to $ 150 per month from about $ 1,300 .But the 55-year-old , who lives in North Carolina and is `` against Obamacare absolutely , '' said she might not buy it . `` Even with that , I 'm not happy , '' Mooney said .California Assemblyman Brian Jones , a conservative Republican in San Diego County , is deeply skeptical of Obamacare , and sees the problems with the federal website as a sign of troubles still to come . But he advises constituents who need coverage to check it out .`` Somebody who does n't have health insurance , if they can get on the exchange and get coverage and they can afford it , then they should do it , '' Jones said . `` And then hope for the best .

SACRAMENTO Calif. ( Reuters ) - The number of Californians without health insurance has been cut in half since the implementation of Obamacare , according to a survey published Thursday .The study by the Commonwealth Fund , a healthcare research foundation , showed that about 11 percent of adults in the most populous U.S. state were uninsured as of last month , down from 22 percent in the summer of 2013 .California was the first state to pass legislation to set up its own marketplace allowing consumers and small businesses to purchase highly regulated coverage under the Affordable Care Act , and the state has also expanded its Medicaid program , providing insurance to more low-income residents .Nationwide , the report showed , an estimated 9.5 million fewer adults between the ages of 19 and 64 were uninsured at the end of the period than at the beginning , bringing the total U.S. rate of uninsured to 15 percent from 20 percent .Among poor adults , the rates of uninsured remained highest in states that did not expand eligibility for Medicaid , the federal low-income healthcare program , the report showed .The highest rates of uninsurance were in Florida and Texas , both states that chose not to expand Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act .( Reporting by Sharon Bernstein ; Editing by Eric Walsh )
SALEM , Va. — Mitt Romney‘s campaign is eagerly awaiting the Supreme Court’s decision on President Obama’s health care law , which is expected on Thursday morning .But on Tuesday , at a machinery company here , Mr. Romney offered a preview of the possible responses he has been readying for when the ruling finally comes .“If Obamacare is not deemed constitutional , then the first three-and-a-half years of this president’s term will have been wasted on something that has not helped the American people , ” Mr. Romney said . “If it is deemed to stand , then I’ll tell you one thing : We’re going to have to have a president , and I’m that one , that’s going to get rid of Obamacare . We’re going to stop it on Day 1.”One of Mr. Romney’s most reliable applause lines has been his promise to repeal what he calls “Obamacare , ” and his comments Tuesday underscored the fact that the Romney team plans to use health care as a campaign issue regardless of the court’s ruling .Mr. Romney also remarked on the court’s decision Monday , to uphold a key provision of Arizona’s controversial 2010 immigration law . Though Mr. Romney and his campaign had studiously avoided the specifics of the ruling on Monday — his traveling press secretary , Rick Gorka , went so far as to hold a seven-minute news conference that did not answer a single question — he began his remarks Tuesday by calling the situation “a muddle.”After criticizing Mr. Obama for failing to push through sweeping immigration reform , Mr. Romney said , “The Supreme Court had to step in because states had to step in , states looking to find a way to solve the problems he didn’t address , tried to address it in their own ways , and now the Supreme Court’s looked at it , and what we’re left with is a bit of a muddle.”He continued : “But what we know is , the president failed to lead . He failed to do what he said he’d do . And so instead of focusing on immigration , and of course on the big issue , which was the economy and getting the economy going , he instead focused on putting in place his health care reform called Obamacare.”Often , as a presidential race heads into the general election battle , the campaigns find themselves engaged in a call and response over the issue of the moment . One side attacks , the other responds , and vice versa . But Tuesday was a departure from that rhythm .Mr. Romney’s campaign sought to keep the focus on the news of the day — the upcoming Supreme Court ruling on health care , which is a topic Mr. Obama’s team would prefer to avoid . And the Obama campaign , in contrast , returned to Mr. Romney’s record as a titan of private equity , releasing a new television ad and line of attacks that portray Mr. Romney as an “outsourcer-in-chief.”The new line of attack — on a subject that the Romney campaign would also prefer to avoid — seeks to demonize Mr. Romney’s time at Bain Capital , and pulls from a Washington Post article last week that alleges that Mr. Romney’s private equity firm invested in a series of firms that relocated jobs overseas to places like India and China .
SIOUX FALLS S.D . — Republican Mike Rounds has won the U.S. Senate seat in a three-way race in South Dakota , CNN projected on Tuesday , a gain for Republicans hoping to take control of the chamber .Rounds , 60 , a former governor of the state , defeated former U.S . Senator Larry Pressler , who ran as an independent , and Democrat Rick Weiland , a one-time aide to former Democratic Senator Tom Daschle . Rounds will succeed retiring Democratic Senator Tim Johnson .When Rounds declared his candidacy two years ago , South Dakota political analysts expected the popular governor who served two terms to have little problem winning the race .Opponents criticized Rounds in the primary and general election over his former administration’s handling of a state program that allows foreign investors to earn green cards by providing $ 500,000 of investments for job-creating projects .The attacks worked for a time , closing the gap to within a few percentage points in late September . But heavy advertising spending by the national Republican Senate campaign committee supported Rounds .Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee also made campaign appearances for Rounds , who had a substantial campaign war chest and recaptured his double-digit leads over Pressler and Weiland .Rounds , an insurance executive from Pierre , campaigned on bringing `` South Dakota common sense '' to Washington , support for the proposed Keystone XL crude oil pipeline and opposition to the Affordable Care Act , known as Obamacare .( Reporting by Diane Bartz in Washington and Todd Epp in South Dakota ; Editing by Peter Cooney )

SOMERSWORTH , New Hampshire — Barack Obama and his Democratic allies in the Congress have grown more confident in recent months about their ability to use the president 's signature healthcare law as a draw rather than a liability in this November 's midterm elections .Three races in New Hampshire illustrate the challenge , offering a test of whether Democrats can overcome voter skepticism about the 2010 Affordable Care Act . The law , aiming to expand health insurance coverage to millions more Americans , has come under sustained attack from Republicans .The president has urged Democrats campaigning in the November 4 congressional elections not to run away from `` Obamacare '' , but instead to `` forcefully defend '' it . Obama has said that a surge in enrollment shows the system is running smoothly now , after its disastrous debut last October .New Hampshire , which is closely divided between Democrats and Republicans , is one of about 10 states where Republicans hope to make gains in order to pick up six seats they need to put the Democratic-led Senate under their control .Senators Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire , Kay Hagan of North Carolina and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana have been among the Democratic targets of anti-Obamacare ads by conservative groups such as Americans for Prosperity .Republicans are counting on voter antipathy toward Obamacare to try to take charge of the Senate and expand their majority in the House of Representatives . But while Obamacare may now be working better , national polls clearly show more people disapprove than approve of the law .HOPING FAMILIARITY BREEDS SUPPORTIn New Hampshire , Shaheen and Representative Carol Shea-Porter , a fellow Democrat , were among the earliest advocates of the healthcare law . The state 's other Democratic Representative , Ann Kuster , was elected after the law passed , but also backs it .Shaheen said in an interview she shared Obama 's view that as Americans get to know Obamacare , they are embracing it . Shaheen said there was `` a lot of misinformation '' about the law . `` The reality is , it 's beginning to work for people , '' she said .But 51 percent of New Hampshire adults oppose Obamacare while just 37 percent support it , the University of New Hampshire Survey Center reported last month in a WMUR-Granite State poll . Sixty-one percent of the state 's voters think medical costs will increase under the act .`` The perception is , 'it will hurt my family and costs will go up ' , '' said Andrew Smith , director of the center . `` In a political campaign , that is a big boulder to push uphill . ''Skeptics include people like Derek Gagnon , a 33-year-old auto mechanic who says he would not even consider voting for anyone who had backed the Affordable Care Act .He has no health insurance , but he also says he has no intention of signing up for the private insurance offered through the government-run website , HealthCare.gov .`` I should n't be forced to do something like that in a free country , '' said Gagnon , referring to the law 's requirement , known as the `` individual mandate , '' that almost all legal U.S. residents buy health insurance or pay a fine .`` I 'll pay the fine this year and next year , '' Gagnon said at a frozen yogurt store outside New Hampshire 's state capital , Concord . `` Maybe I wo n't have to pay it the third year , because by then Obama will be out of office . ''Gagnon 's distaste for the individual mandate dovetails with a principal line of conservative attacks nationally on the law .Obamacare is meant to extend subsidized health coverage to millions of uninsured Americans through new online private insurance markets and an expansion of the Medicaid program for the poor . But conservative critics portray it as a government intrusion in a major sector of the economy that will hurt job growth and erode freedoms .Shaheen 's leading Republican opponent in the Senate race , Scott Brown , is betting that theme will resonate in New Hampshire , where the state 's famous motto is `` Live Free or Die . ''In April , Brown kicked off his candidacy with the declaration that New Hampshire could `` Live Free or Log On '' - a caustic reference to signing up online for Obamacare .Lately , he has been traveling the state on an `` Obamacare Is n't Working '' tour . Brown , a former senator from neighboring Massachusetts , says the act should be completely repealed and the issue of healthcare reform should be left to the states .Brown has been rising in the polls against Shaheen . But she was ahead 45 to 39 percent in a recent WMUR-Granite State poll .MORE THAN HEALTHCARE AT STAKEDean Spiliotes , a New Hampshire political analyst , said Shaheen , a former New Hampshire governor , still had political capital in the state , and he doubted the healthcare issue alone could defeat her .`` People view her as not an ideologue . That has helped her with voters , '' said Spiliotes , a political science professor at Southern New Hampshire University . `` If Obamacare rises to the level of taking out Jeanne Shaheen , there is something larger going on . ''To be sure , Obamacare faces unique challenges in New Hampshire . Just one insurance company in the small state offered insurance policies through the program this year , and the insurer does n't cover healthcare in 10 of the state 's 26 hospitals , deficits Shaheen and Shea-Porter have been working to fix .Spiliotes said New Hampshire Democrats are defending Obamacare `` but they are kind of doing it in fits and starts . It 's not a uniform , rah-rah kind of support . ''In one hopeful sign for Democrats , enrollment in Obamacare in the state of 1.3 million people has reached 40,000 - double the number that had been expected .Shea-Porter , a former social worker who came to Congress in 2006 campaigning on healthcare reform , said she would never run away from healthcare reform , even though she has been critical of its implementation .`` In my mind , this was a great joy and a triumph to be able to vote for healthcare for millions of Americans who had none , '' she said . `` I am always going to support it . ''That said , she understands the political perils for Democrats of Obamacare . She lost her seat in Congress in 2010 elections after her vote for the law , only to be re-elected in 2012 . Her 2014 race is considered a toss-up although her Republican opponent has yet to be chosen in a September primary .Shea-Porter , who met last week with recent healthcare enrollees in Somersworth , said she is aware of the qualms some people have , including wariness of providing personal information on a government website .But she said the best way to advertise Obamacare 's benefits is to publicize the stories of people who signed up and discovered that `` nothing terrible happened . ''Patrice Glynn , 54-year-old New Hampshire resident , is already convinced . Glynn , a diabetic , lived without health insurance for nine months after she lost her job and before she signed up on HealthCare.gov . `` If it was so bad , would 40,000 people be on it ? '' she asked .( The story is refiled to clarify Shea-Porter position by adding full quote and criticism in paragraphs 26-27 )( Editing by Caren Bohan and Frances Kerry )
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has done his best to stay neutral in the intra-Republican war over whether to shut down the government in order to stop the implementation of the Affordable Care Act . Although he acknowledged in August that the plan wouldn’t actually work , he told The Washington Post’s Greg Sargent that he did not mean to take sides in the dispute .That’s not exactly leader-like behavior , but perhaps he calculated that , politically , his best bet was to stay quiet .Turns out he bet wrong . The Senate Conservatives Fund , a Tea Party affiliated group , has launched a $ 340,000 ad campaign against Mr. McConnell that characterizes him as a weak leader . Of course from the Tea Party perspective , leadership doesn’t involve speaking out against an ill-conceived scheme that’s bound to fail—it means backing that scheme . “Obamacare starts in October but Congress can stop its funding , ” the ad states . “What’s Mitch McConnell doing ? Nothing . McConnell is the Senate Republican leader , but he refuses to lead on defunding Obamacare . What good is a leader like that ? ”The ad , which is airing in Mr. McConnell’s home state of Kentucky starting today through Sept. 17 , makes no mention of the fact that “defunding Obamacare” would involve opposing any continuing resolution that funds the law—i.e . shutting down the entire government . Perhaps that’s because the Senate Conservatives Fund realizes that this niggling detail would put off moderate viewers .

Senator Harry Reid of Nevada , the majority leader , has made little secret of his disdain for Tea Party Republicans , saying they will own the blame for any government shutdown .On Monday , shortly after the Senate voted to reject the spending bill that has the backing of the conservative House Republican conference , Mr. Reid excoriated his colleagues in the House and their leader , Speaker John A. Boehner .The Affordable Care Act , he said , would not be touched as part of any budget deal .“Our negotiation is over with , ” he said , blaming what he called the “Banana Republican mind-set” for the budget impasse .“They are closing down the government , ” he said . “I don’t know what in the world is wrong with them , why they’re fixated on this Obamacare . It is the law.”“You know , with a bully , you can not let them slap you around , because they slap you around today , they slap you five or six times tomorrow , ” Mr. Reid , a former boxer , said . “We are not going to be bullied.”
Senator Harry Reid of Nevada , the majority leader , has made little secret of his disdain for Tea Party Republicans , saying they will own the blame for any government shutdown .On Monday , shortly after the Senate voted to reject the spending bill that has the backing of the conservative House Republican conference , Mr. Reid excoriated his colleagues in the House and their leader , Speaker John A. Boehner .The Affordable Care Act , he said , would not be touched as part of any budget deal .“Our negotiation is over with , ” he said , blaming what he called the “Banana Republican mind-set” for the budget impasse .“They are closing down the government , ” he said . “I don’t know what in the world is wrong with them , why they’re fixated on this Obamacare .

Senator Mike Lee , Republican of Utah , may have only been trying to support House Republicans , but some comments from Mr. Lee — one of the captains of the effort to defund the health care law — are upsetting the Republican ranks .In an interview with The Salt Lake Tribune , Mr. Lee spoke out in support of a new strategy to pass piecemeal spending bills to reopen the government slowly while working toward concessions from Democrats .He said the House had taken three different stabs at denying funds for , delaying or damaging the health care law , which he ardently opposes . But no Democratic broke ranks in the Senate .“In light of that , let’s leave Obamacare for another day and not hold hostage the vast majority of government functions , ” Mr. Lee said .Many House Republicans were already angry at Senator Ted Cruz , Republican of Texas , who led the charge to link further government financing to a crippling of the health care law . After the House passed legislation to do that , Mr. Cruz released a statement conceding it would go nowhere in the Senate and urged House Republicans to stay strong .Now his main lieutenant , Mr. Lee , has also undermined the cause , Republican aides in the House and Senate said Tuesday .

Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky hates the Affordable Care Act . So does Kentucky’s senior senator , Mitch McConnell — though apparently not quite enough to stave off a primary fight . The Senate Conservatives Fund has endorsed Mr. McConnell’s Tea Party challenger , Matt Bevin , who charged in a television spot that “McConnell helped Barack Obama and Harry Reid fund Obamacare.” By that he meant that Mr. McConnell worked to end the government shutdown and raise the debt ceiling to avoid default .And yet , with this bickering in the background , Kentucky has been unusually successful in rolling out its health insurance marketplace . Dylan Scott wrote in Talking Points Memo yesterday that “more than 26,000 people have enrolled in coverage , more than 50,000 have started applications and more than 300,000 unique visitors have checked out what the marketplace has to offer.” That’s in a state where roughly one in six are uninsured . Kentucky , in Mr. Scott’s formulation , may have “built the country’s best Obamacare Website.”The question is , will the disconnect between Kentuckians’ actual experience with the Affordable Care Act , and what their senators say about the Affordable Care Act , matter in the next election ? Could Mr. Bevin’s strategy backfire ?
Serving black voters , health care and economic issues were among the talking points that sparked clashes during debates Tuesday ahead of next month 's midterm elections . Highlights:___ILLINOIS : FIGHTING FOR BLACK VOTEDemocratic Gov . Pat Quinn and Republican businessman Bruce Rauner defended their records on minority hiring , public safety and gun control during a debate that focused heavily on issues impacting African-American voters .Meeting for their second televised debate , Quinn said that as governor he 's hired minorities in key administration positions — including in the post of deputy governor — but said Rauner , a venture capitalist , did n't hire African-Americans at the highest levels of his firm .`` Our cabinet is diverse and many African-Americans are heading departments , '' Quinn said .In response , Rauner said he hired minorities at his firm as did many of the hundreds of companies in which the firm invested , though he did n't answer when asked how many of them were in executive roles . The first-time candidate also said Quinn 's policies have failed blacks in Illinois , noting high unemployment among African-American men .`` Gov . Quinn is taking the African-American vote for granted , '' Rauner said . `` African-American families are suffering . ''__LOUISIANA : OBAMA 'S ROLEDemocratic Sen. Mary Landrieu framed Louisiana 's Senate election as a referendum on her three terms in office , not the policies of unpopular President Barack Obama , in the first TV debate featuring all three major contenders in the race .While the Democratic incumbent defended her vote for Obama 's federal health care overhaul , she suggested it needed improvement . She distanced herself from Obama 's energy policies and talked of her work with presidents over the years , both Republican and Democrat .`` While President Obama is not on the ballot , the future of Louisiana is , '' Landrieu said .Her main challenger , Republican Rep. Bill Cassidy , repeatedly tied Landrieu to Obama 's policies , saying a vote for her would be a vote for the president 's agenda .`` She represents Barack Obama . I represent you , '' Cassidy said .GOP candidate and tea party favorite Rob Maness positioned himself as the Washington outsider . `` Our future is in danger from poor leadership from career politicians , '' he said .___ARKANSAS : HEALTH CARE TANGLEDemocratic Sen. Mark Pryor and Republican Rep. Tom Cotton tangled over the impact of the federal health overhaul , with Pryor accusing Cotton of not having any solution for nearly 200,000 Arkansans receiving coverage under the federal law through the state 's `` private option '' Medicaid expansion if Cotton gets his wish to repeal the law .Pryor also questioned what would happen to those benefiting from other parts of the law , such as its prohibition on denying coverage for pre-existing conditions . `` He has no answer on any of this , but he is insistent on repealing it , '' Pryor said .Cotton criticized Pryor for his vote for the overhaul and said repealing it would allow for reforming the health care system and giving states control over programs such as Medicaid . `` I think we have to start over on health care reform because Obamacare is a disaster , '' Cotton said .The two also sparred over Cotton 's vote against the farm bill , with the Republican saying the practice of including food stamp funding in the measure needs to end . Pryor said the vote showed Cotton was out of touch with a state that relies heavily on agriculture .___SOUTH CAROLINA : JOB GROWTHRepublican Gov . Nikki Haley touted the more than 50,000 jobs announced by her administration while those challenging her contended those numbers were not real .Democratic state Sen. Vincent Sheheen said roughly half of the announced jobs have shown up and many of the planned openings already have fallen through . Haley countered that the promised jobs do n't happen overnight , saying `` it will take a while . ''Independent candidate Tom Ervin asked Haley to post the incentives given to lure companies to South Carolina , so taxpayers can judge whether they 're worth it . He said she had `` given away the farm when it comes to economic incentives . ''Libertarian Steve French also criticized Haley on incentives . `` I look at jobs like I look at sex , '' he said . `` You should n't brag about it if you have to pay for it . ''United Citizens candidate Morgan Bruce Reeves said the answer to the state 's economy is legalizing marijuana .___MINNESOTA : MIDDLE-CLASS CHAMPIONSDemocratic Gov . Mark Dayton and Republican challenger Jeff Johnson 's third debate was their feistiest yet , with Johnson on the offensive as he tries to make up ground in the race and the pair arguing over who is the better friend of the middle class .Johnson , a county commissioner in Minneapolis , said Dayton 's roots as privileged heir to a department store fortune mean he does n't know what it 's like to pay a mortgage or college tuition . Dayton pointed out he worked to freeze college tuition , signed a minimum-wage hike and increased school budgets . And he said Johnson would lower taxes on the rich and roll back some of the minimum wage increases .Dayton called Johnson a `` huckster '' for promising permits for copper-nickel mining on Minnesota 's Iron Range before environmental studies are complete . Johnson accused Dayton of waffling on a gas tax , or at least the exact form it would take .___UTAH : PITCHING BIPARTISANSHIPIn Utah 's 4th Congressional District race , both Democrat Doug Owens and Republican Mia Love tried to portray themselves as the candidate more likely to work across political divides if elected to the House .Owens has sought to paint Love as holding extreme views while pointing to the example set by his own father , former Democratic Rep. Wayne Owens . Love has contended that Owens has attacked her instead of the issues , saying that if more decisions were made at a local level instead of in Washington , there would be less of a partisan divide .`` When you get the decision-making close to people , you see party lines go away , '' she said .If she wins the race , Love would be the first black female Republican ever elected to Congress .___Associated Press writers Sophia Tareen and Sara Burnett in Chicago ; Melinda Deslatte in Shreveport , Louisiana ; Andrew DeMillo in Fayetteville , Arkansas ; Seanna Adcox in Columbia , South Carolina ; Brian Bakst in Duluth , Minnesota ; and Michelle Price in Salt Lake City contributed to this report .
Sharron Angle , a Nevada Republican and Tea Party favorite , announced on Thursday that she was endorsing Rick Santorum for president . Ms . Angle issued a statement to the National Review:Rick Santorum and I have known each other for years . He is a strong fiscal and social conservative who stands on principles above politics . He has never wavered in his support for family values , understanding the impact that strong families have on a prosperous economy . His continuous opposition to amnesty , Obamacare , the bailouts , and cap and trade are a perfect fit with our Main Street Tea Party movement .On his Web site , Mr. Santorum called Ms . Angle a tough fighter for conservative values in her unsuccessful bid for the Senate against Harry Reid:“Despite tens of millions of dollars thrown against her , Sharron did not back down and stood tall for repealing Obamacare and for the traditional values that make America great . I am thrilled to receive her endorsement , and I am confident it will be a terrific boon to our campaign as the Nevada caucus approaches.”
So , are we going to have a crisis over the debt ceiling again ? Everyone seems to assume that we won’t , that Republicans have learned their lesson , and that they’ll huff and puff before slinking away into the shadows . But there’s a problem : the GOP leadership has been telling the base to chill on the idea of shutting down the government to defund Obamacare , that they’ll use the debt limit instead . And so far nobody seems to have been willing to admit that this won’t work either .And part of the problem may be , once again , the complete lack of actual policy analysis on the right . Apparently Eric Cantor is floating the idea of demanding a one-year delay in Obamacare in return for not forcing America into bankruptcy ; Greg Sargent emails a Republican aide for clarification , and get this reponse:It’s absolutely one of the possible outcomes of a debt limit negotiation , and likely given the President’s proclivity for delaying sections of this law . Whether it’s a mandate delay , or delaying the law entirely , it depends on a great deal of other factors .OK , this represents a complete failure to understand how the health reform works . As I’ve tried to explain , three things are essential : nondiscrimination , the individual mandate , and subsidies . Other things , like the employer mandate , can be delayed without undermining the basic working of the plan . But Republicans don’t know any of that ; they haven’t tried to understand Obamacare , they’ve just denounced it . And so they mistake Obama’s flexibility on side issues for a willingness to retreat on the essentials , which he won’t do .In other words , the wonk gap might cause the GOP to stumble into disaster .
So , very early reports are that Obamacare exchanges are , as expected , having some technical glitches on the first day — maybe even a bit worse than expected , because it appears that volume has been much bigger than predicted .Here’s what you need to know : this is good , not bad , news for the program . The glitches will get fixed ; remember the calamitous rollout of Medicare Part D ? What matters is whether enough people — especially , of course , young , healthy people — actually do sign up for insurance . If they do , health reform will be a success , and will become irreversible .The big fear has been that a combination of ignorance and misinformation would keep people away , that they wouldn’t sign up either because they didn’t know that insurance was now available , or because Republicans had convinced them that the program was the spawn of the devil , or something . Lots of people logging on and signing up on the very first day — a day when the Kamikaze Kongress is dominating the headlines — is an early indication that it’s going to be fine , that plenty of people will sign up for the first year of health reform .Yes , there may be some negative news stories about the glitches . But Obamacare is not up for a revote . As Jonathan Bernstein says , the only thing that matters is whether it works . And today’s heavy volume is yet another sign — along with abating health costs and below-expected premiums — that it will .
So far , nearly all of the left-of-center responses to the latest C.B.O . projections on Obamacare and workforce participation have emphasized the upside of the downward trend — the fact that what we’re seeing is just the end of job lock in action , which gives parents the freedom to cut their hours , near-retirees the chance to stop working a job they hate a little early , and so on down a sympathetic list . “If Obamacare really does cause millions of people to voluntarily leave full-time employment , ” Matt Yglesias writes in a representative piece , “that shows us how much avoidable suffering the earlier system was causing , ” and you can find roughly similar arguments from Jonathan Cohn , Jonathan Chait , and others too numerous to name .The issue that I’d really like to see liberals reckon with comes from this post by Tyler Cowen , which I’ll quote at length:In two papers , one of which is quite recent , and does not stem from the Heritage Foundation , [ Alan ] Krueger shows rather convincingly that the unemployed maintain reservation wages which are simply too high . They would be better off lowering those wages , being more realistic , accepting work , and getting back on their feet again . In other settings ( not considered by Krueger ) , other workers seem to be too slow to move to new areas for new jobs , given the costs of being unemployed long-term .… OK , given all that , when those workers , hit by negative shocks , do not rush to go back to work at lower reservation wages , we then read a portrait of hysteresis , despair , and soul-crushing joblessness , a psychic swamp so difficult to escape that even summoning up the strength to go back to work may be difficult .In other words , would-be workers irrationally undervalue the benefits of having a job and they also underestimate the costs of remaining unemployed .Now let’s switch settings . A benefit shock comes along , positive for many people , and it induces many of them to work less or not work at all . How happy should we be ? And here I mean happy at the margin , due to their change in employment decision .People , it is rather difficult to have it here both ways . I guess it is possible that workers are irrational in changing their employment decisions in response to changes in relative dollar wage opportunities , but rational when changing their employment decisions in response to changes in relative benefit opportunities . It really is possible . But are any of you actually arguing that or holding some deep-seated reason for believing in that difference , other than perhaps the reason this post might have induced you to come up with ? No , I see one assumption about a destructive choice in one context and the opposing assumption about a beneficial choice in the other context , without much regard for the tension or contradiction between those two assumptions … .… A simpler possibility is that people undervalue the long-term benefits of having a job and thus in both settings the contraction in employment is a quite negative outcome . That is then very bad news for ACA , if only in expected value terms .Here is how I would frame the issue : There are specific classes of people who plainly benefit , in fairly uncomplicated ways , from benefits that provide an incentive to work less , or leave a job outright . The obvious examples are the ones that liberals keep invoking : Parents of young children ( for whom the family-friendly tax overhaul that conservative reformers like to tout would presumably have a similar effect ) , and people with a disability or chronic medical condition that makes work a simple misery .But there also lots of people who emphatically do not benefit from being given an incentive to either detach from the workforce or ( if they’re already unemployed or underemployed ) remain detached rather than taking a lower-paying job . And given the current economic landscape , especially — in which persistently high unemployment coexists with a growing population of workers too discouraged to even look for work — the size and scope of a work-discouraging effect matters a great deal : The bigger the effect , the more likely that the people dropping out aren’t just , say , parents cutting hours to spend more time at home while the other spouse works full time , but people we should want to be attached to the workforce , for their own long-term good and the good of the economy as well .Which is why it’s appropriate that the new C.B.O . projection of 2 million to 2.5 million job-equivalents disappearing has inspired more disquiet and debate than the old projection of 500,000-900,000 … because it’s a sign , however provisional , that the costs of Obamacare’s workforce effects might exceed the benefits . I don’t see liberals reckoning seriously with that possibility , and I think they really should .
Some commenters have asked a good question , albeit in a belligerent tone : how does the Ryan plan differ from the Affordable Care Act ? After all , in both plans people are supposed to buy coverage from private insurers , with a subsidy from the government .Well , the answer is that the ACA is specifically designed to ensure that insurance is affordable , whereas Ryancare just hands out vouchers and washes its hands . Specifically , the ACA subsidy system ( pdf ) sets a maximum percentage of income that families are expected to pay for insurance , on a sliding scale that rises with income . To the extent that the actual cost of a minimum acceptable policy exceeds that percentage of income , subsidies make up the difference .Ryancare , by contrast , provides a fixed sum — end of story . And because this fixed sum would not grow with rising health care costs , it’s almost guaranteed to fall far short of the actual cost of insurance .This is also why Ryancare is NOT premium support ; it’s a voucher system . No matter how much they say it isn’t , that’s exactly what it is .
Some notes for myself : how much impact have Obama’s policies actually had on current and prospective inequality ?The main policies to consider are PPACA ( the health reform ) and ATRA ( the fiscal cliff deal with its associated tax rise ) .I’m not a fan of the Tax Foundation’s work , but their analysis of the distributional effects of Obamacare looks about right : significant benefits to the bottom half of the income distribution , paid for largely by taxes on the top few percent ( the Medicare surcharge and the extra tax on investment income ) . The Tax Policy Center — whose work I do trust — has the Act reducing the after-tax income of the top 1 percent by 1.8 percent , the top 0.1 percent by 2.5 percent .Meanwhile , ATRA raises taxes relative to a continuation of the Bush high-end tax cuts : after-tax income down 4.5 percent for the 1-percenters , 6.2 percent for the top 0.1 percent .Putting this together , we have a roughly 6 percent hit to the 1 percent , around 9 to the superelite . That’s only a partial rollback of these groups’ huge gains since 1980 , but it’s not trivial .

Somehow , thinking about the ongoing struggle to fix the Obamacare bugs made me think of this:
Something really interesting is happening on the health-care front : costs are rising much less rapidly than anyone expected . This is good news for the budget ; it’s also good news for Obamacare . There was much skepticism about promises that health reform would “bend the curve” , reducing cost growth ; well , the curve is bending , and it’s likely that the cost control measures that are part of Obamacare ( and have been in effect for several years ) are part of the reason .One thing I haven’t seen mentioned much , however , is that another aspect of recent developments — the rapid rise in Medicaid enrollment , despite Republican efforts to block it — adds to the prospect of continuing good news on health costs .Medicaid gets a bad rap . It’s a poor people’s program , and it’s widely assumed that this means poor care . In fact , there’s not much evidence that this is true , and claims that Medicaid patients can’t find care are greatly exaggerated . Beyond that , however , Medicaid is the piece of the US health care system ( aside from the VA ) that does the best job of controlling costs . It does this by being able to say no . For example , it’s able ( in a way Medicare so far can’t ) to say that it won’t pay for me-too drugs that are far more expensive than equally or almost equally good alternatives . This ability to say no , combined with its size , means that Medicaid covers people far more cheaply than private insurance , and probably than Medicare .One way to think about this is that Medicaid is actually the piece of the US system that looks most like European health systems , which cost far less than ours while delivering comparable results .Now , expanded Medicaid is a key part of Obamacare — and so far , despite GOP obstruction , Medicaid enrollments have outpaced insurance through the exchanges . This is often reported as if it were a bad thing — as if Medicaid were somehow a fake solution , as if only purchases of private insurance count . But Medicaid is good , very cost-effective coverage ! And rising Medicaid enrollment is , aside from a huge benefit to the previously uninsured , a step toward better cost control in the system as a whole .So liberals , don’t apologize for Medicaid growth . In economic and human terms , it’s just what the , um , doctor ordered .
Soon after the Supreme Court ruling on President Obama’s health care law was announced , Republican leaders took to Twitter with a new hashtag , # fullrepeal , aimed at helping to focus the conversation on ousting Mr. Obama in November and reversing the law .The fight for # FullRepeal begins NOW . The way to get rid of # Obamacare is to defeat Obama in November .— RNC ( @ GOP ) 28 Jun 12The hashtag and a new video on YouTube titled “The Final Verdict” are part of a social media strategy that Republican Party leaders agreed upon with Romney campaign officials this week in the event the court allowed the health care overhaul law to stand .On Facebook , there’s a Repeal It Now page with a link to a petition and fund-raising drive .As part of the plan , the Republican National Committee also introduced a new Web site , People v. Obamacare on Thursday morning to provide what it said was information for people “so they can continue to fight for free market health care solutions that will decrease costs and increase care.”Users who do a Google search for Republican National Committee are directed to the new Web site , which features a tab showing the conversation on Twitter around the # fullrepeal discussion .“Today’s Supreme Court decision sets the stakes for the November election , ” said Reince Priebus , chairman of the Republican National Committee in announcing the debut of site . “Now , the only way to save the country from Obamacare’s budget-busting government takeover of health care is to elect a new resident.”To help drive the # fullrepeal message , the committee bought advertising space on Twitter , using what it is calling a promoted tweet , which directed people who were searching for information about the law to the new Web site .By noon on Thursday , # fullrepeal was a trending topic on Twitter . According to Topsy analytics , the term has been mentioned thousands of times in the last 24 hours .The Romney campaign embraced the hashtag with Andrea Saul , press secretary for Mr. Romney , using it throughout the day to announce updates on Twitter about how much money Mr. Romney had raised online from people upset with the decision .9,500+ donations to @ MittRomney & Victory today for # FullRepeal $ 1.1 million & climbing— Andrea Saul ( @ andreamsaul ) 28 Jun 12The # fullrepeal hashtag accompanied Twitter posts from the National Republican Senatorial Committee ; House Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio ; Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia , the House majority leader ; and even the College Republicans before the coordinated , strategic messaging spread to supporters across the country .On July 11th , the House will once again vote to repeal ObamaCare . # healthcare # fullrepeal— Eric Cantor ( @ GOPLeader ) 28 Jun 12# fullrepeal # 4jobs RT @ GOPLeader : During the week of July 9th , the House of Representatives will once again repeal ObamaCare .— Speaker John Boehner ( @ SpeakerBoehner ) 28 Jun 12McConnell : “The Supreme Court has spoken .

James Lankford ( @ RepLankford ) 28 Jun 12On the other side of the debate , supporters used Twitter to criticize the new Web site .@ GOP you mean peoplevromneycare ?— Raymond Rehayem ( @ libraryeye ) 28 Jun 12And to suggest new hashtags . In this case , a Twitter user suggested # moveforward .. @ GOPLeader : “For the next 5 years , I’ll keep putting politics before progress , despite overwhelming public sentiment to # MoveForward.”— Jonas Heineman ( @ SanFranCitizen ) 28 Jun 12
Speaking on the House floor Monday morning , Speaker John A. Boehner showed no signs of backing down in the fight over tying a delay in President Obama’s signature health care law to continued financing of the government , arguing that the health care law “is not ready for prime time.”“The House has done its work , ” he said . “We passed a bill on Saturday night — sent it to the United States Senate — that would delay Obamacare for one year , and would eliminate permanently the medical device tax that is costing us tens of thousands of jobs that are being shipped overseas.”Mr. Boehner criticized the Senate for not working over the weekend , a deliberate ploy by Mr. Reid to run down the clock and leave House Republicans with unpalatable options before the government shuts down at midnight : To either pass a spending bill without policy perscriptions to keep the government funded and open , or to double down on their hard-line stance and possibly be blamed for the ensuing shutdown .“Senate decided not to work yesterday , ” Mr. Boehner continued . “Well my goodness , if there’s such an emergency , where are they ? It’s time for the Senate to listen to the American people just like the House has listened to the American people and to pass a one-year delay of Obamacare and a permanent repeal of the medical device tax.”
Suppose that Congress decides that everyone in America should have an iPhone . There are two ways it can do this:1 ) The government could allocate money to buy all Americans iPhones .2 ) The government could require that everybody buy an iPhone but create a tax credit equivalent to the price of the phone .To an economist , these things are pretty much identical . To a politician , they are very different . The first is a big-spending government giveaway . The second is a tax cut . And in that distinction lies the heart of the firestorm around comments by one of the intellectual godfathers of President Obama’s health reform law .That would be Jonathan Gruber , an M.I.T . health economist who helped design the Massachusetts health reforms on which Obamacare was based and then advised the Obama administration on that program’s design . At an academic panel in 2013 , he said that “this bill was written in a tortured way to make sure” the Congressional Budget Office “did not score the mandate as taxes.” He also said that “lack of transparency is a huge political advantage , ” and added , `` Call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever , but basically that was really , really critical to getting the thing to pass.”It looks like a shocking instance of a onetime Obama adviser saying that the administration pulled the wool over America’s eyes in advancing major legislation . That is certainly how many conservatives are interpreting it after a video of the remarks started circulating this week .But here’s the dirty little secret : Mr. Gruber was exposing something sordid yet completely commonplace about how Congress makes policy of all types : Legislators frequently game policy to fit the sometimes arbitrary conventions by which the Congressional Budget Office evaluates laws and the public debates them .In the case of the Affordable Care Act , that meant structuring the law so that the money Americans must pay the Internal Revenue Service if they fail to obtain health insurance under the law’s mandate is a penalty , not a tax . ( The Supreme Court held that , though not a tax , the penalties were constitutional because they were an exercise of Congress’s taxing authority , which is the kind of distinction only a lawyer could come up with ) . That’s the reason the financial assistance the health law gives people to buy insurance is structured as a tax credit , not a direct payment , which would probably be simpler and more efficient .And as Sarah Kliff notes at Vox , it is also why the law was structured to expand insurance coverage three years after passage . That way its cost estimate by the C.B.O . was kept under $ 1 trillion during the first decade after enactment . One trillion was the highest number that Democratic leaders thought was politically feasible .This kind of gamesmanship is very much a bipartisan affair . President George W. Bush’s expansion of Medicare in 2003 was carefully designed so that its costs were backloaded , rising sharply just after its 10-year mark . Estimating costs in the 10-year window is an ( arbitrary ) convention for C.B.O . scoring of pending legislation . The design of the law made it seem less costly than it was expected to be over a longer time period .To economists , it doesn’t matter whether our hypothetical iPhones are bought directly by the government or “bought” through tax cuts . It doesn’t matter whether Obamacare’s subsidies happen through a tax credit or a check in the mail . It doesn’t matter whether the costs of Bush’s Medicare expansion were projected over a 10-year time horizon or 15 .In business school , they teach that there are two types of accounting . Financial accounting must follow the strict , and frequently arbitrary , rules of generally accepted accounting principles in preparing the financial statements released to investors . But a different approach , cost accounting , is for managers trying to understand the true economics of their business , such as whether a given business line is profitable . In cost accounting , the goal is less about following some set of rules to report to outsiders and more about understanding what is really in the company’s best interest .Essentially , Congress is obsessed with the government equivalent of financial accounting standards ( with the C.B.O . as the rule maker ) instead of cost accounting . It structures the laws in ways that might not be very efficient but sound good on the stump . Mr. Gruber was , in an infelicitous way , expressing frustration with that state of affairs .
Suppose that healthcare.gov isn’t fixed by the end of next month . How bad is it for Obamacare ? Would the program be doomed ?No , says Jonathan Cohn , because there are two layers of protection against poor signup . First , there is a system of cross-subsidies to insurance companies that was intended to prevent companies from surreptitiously gaining an advantage by only signing up healthy people ( hey , our policy is available to anyone — but you have to sign up in our sixth-floor walkup office . ) As it turns out , this system would end up compensating insurance companies in general if the risk pool is worse than expected . Second , the subsidies to individuals are designed to hold health costs down to 8 percent of income , which means that they will rise if costs are higher than expected .Neither of these would be a good thing , since they would increase the budget cost , but they do mean that Obamacare’s survival probably isn’t on the line .Actually , the biggest reason Obama and co. should be anxious to fix these things now , I’d argue , isn’t the fate of the program itself , which can survive even large early wobbles , but the midterm elections . If Obamacare is fixed , Republicans will be in the position of attacking a program that is benefiting millions of Americans ; if it isn’t , they can still run against the legend , not the fact .So a lot is riding on fixing the technological botch — but not in quite the way people imagine .
TAMPA , Fla. – Representative Paul D. Ryan , framing the presidential election as the “clearest choice possible , ” intends to use his prime-time moment at the Republican National Convention on Wednesday night to assure Americans that he and Mitt Romney can oversee a strong economic recovery .“We have a plan for a stronger middle class , with the goal of generating 12 million new jobs over the next four years , ” Mr. Ryan , who has become the party’s leader on economic policy , will say , according to excerpts provided by the campaign .In the excerpts , Mr. Ryan takes some strong shots at President Obama , noting that a new Republican administration would “not spend four years blaming others – we will take responsibility.”“After four years of getting the runaround , America needs a turnaround , and the man for the job is Gov . Mitt Romney , ” Mr. Ryan will say in his speech , which presents a major opportunity for him to make the case for denying Mr. Obama a second term .In a reference to Mr. Ryan’s budget plan and the partisan division over his plans to overhaul Medicare and cut spending , Mr. Ryan’s remarks say : “We will not duck the tough issues – we will lead.”In accepting his party’s vice-presidential nomination , Mr. Ryan will also renew the Republican push to repeal the new health care law – a pledge certain to meet with a strong response in the convention hall .“ ‘Obamacare’ comes to more than 2,000-pages of rules , mandates , taxes , fees and fines that have no place in a free country , ” he says in the excerpts . “The president has declared that the debate over government-controlled health care is over . That will come as news to the millions of Americans who will elect Mitt Romney so we can repeal ‘Obamacare.’ ”As the storm-shortened convention headed into its second full day of activities , Mr. Ryan , the Wisconsin lawmaker who leads the House Budget Committee , was the unequivocal star attraction in a lineup of speakers that was heavy on Mr. Ryan’s Congressional colleagues , including Senator John McCain , the party’s unsuccessful 2008 presidential nominee .Mr. Ryan’s speech was to provide the biggest opportunity yet for the 42-year-old conservative to make the case for his vision — embraced by Congressional Republicans and much of the party’s intelligentsia — of how to rein in soaring entitlement spending , shrink the size of government and alter federal spending priorities . His admirers were expecting him to shine .“Tonight , the American people — millions who may not know a lot about Paul Ryan other than the headlines that they’ve read — are going to get to know Paul Ryan the way many of us know him ; as a serious policy thinker , ” Senator Marco Rubio , Republican of Florida , said on ABC’s “Good Morning America.” He called Mr. Ryan someone who “brings a unique life experience and a unique perspective on some of the issues that we face because of his age , because of our generation but , at the same time , someone who is as deep and serious a thinker about our issues as ever before.”Democrats were just as eager as Republicans to focus public attention on Mr. Ryan and his plans . A group of top Democrats arrived in Tampa to slice and dice Mr. Ryan’s budget . The Democratic National Committee took out a full-page ad in The Tampa Tribune to accuse Mr. Ryan of trying to “end Medicare as we know it” through his proposal to provide federal health insurance subsidies for future retirees so they can buy private insurance rather than enroll in Medicare . The party also has two billboards with similar themes in the vicinity of the convention hall and plans to have a plane pull a banner Wednesday night with the message : “Romney-Ryan : Wrong for the Middle Class.”Even as the political sniping went on , the convention managers and the Romney campaign were closely monitoring events unfolding along the Gulf Coast just a few hundred miles away as Hurricane Isaac pummeled Louisiana with rain and wind , causing flooding and providing a stark televised contrast to the convention festivities .Besides Mr. Ryan and Mr. McCain , the speakers were to include Senators Mitch McConnell of Kentucky , John Thune of South Dakota and Rob Portman of Ohio ; Mr. Portman was among the top contenders for the vice-presidential slot that went to Mr. Ryan .

THE 2014 midterms have featured many variables and one constant . Whether they’re running as incumbents or challengers , campaigning in blue or red or purple states , Democratic candidates have all been dragging an anchor : a president from their party whose approval ratings haven’t been north of 45 percent since last October .The interesting question is why . You may recall that Mitt Romney built his entire 2012 campaign strategy around the assumption that a terrible economy would suffice to deny Barack Obama a second term . Yet throughout 2012 , with the unemployment rate still up around 8 percent , Obama’s approval numbers stayed high enough ( the mid-to-upper 40s ) to ultimately win . Whereas today the unemployment rate has fallen to 6 percent , a number Team Obama would have traded David Axelrod’s right kidney for two years ago , but the White House hasn’t benefited : The public’s confidence is gone , and it doesn’t seem to be coming back .So when and how was it lost ? When President Bush’s second-term job approval numbers tanked , despite decent-at-the-time economic numbers , the explanation was easy : It was Iraq , Iraq , Iraq . But nothing quite so pat presents itself in Obama’s case , so here are four partial theories instead .He gets blamed for Republican intransigence . This is the explanation that many Obama partisans favor , because it lets him mostly off the hook . The theory is that with the country as polarized as it is , and with the public inclined to blame the president for gridlock , the natural state for presidential approval ratings is a kind of regression toward the low 40s . This regression can be interrupted only by either some major unforeseen event or the emergence of a challenger — Romney for Obama , John Kerry for George W. Bush — who reminds voters that they dislike the other party more . But once the challenger is beaten , the process resumes : Just as Bush’s post-9/11 ratings declined steadily except when Kerry was on the scene , so too Obama’s numbers were doomed to decay once he won a second term .It’s the economy — yes , still : This explanation raises an eyebrow at the last one and says , come on : If the economy were enjoying a 1990s-style boom , surely Obama would have a decent chance at Clinton-level approval ratings , gridlock or no gridlock ! But even with the improving employment picture this recovery is still basically a disappointment , especially for the middle class . So the contrast between Obama’s position in 2012 and his weaker one today isn’t necessarily a case study in the economy not mattering . It’s an example of voter patience persisting for a while , and finally running out .It’s Obamacare — yes , still . This is the closest equivalent to Bush and the Iraq War : The health care law is Obama’s signature issue , it remains largely unpopular ( even if support for full repeal is weak ) , and its initial stumbling coincided with the sharpest second-term drop in the president’s approval . Fixing the website may have stabilized the system , but by design Obamacare still creates many losers as well as winners , and a persistent dissatisfaction with shifts in coverage and costs could be the crucial drag keeping Americans dissatisfied with their president as well .It’s foreign policy — and competence . One of the interesting features of the 2012 campaign was that as much as the economy made Obama’s sales pitch challenging , he had an edge that Democratic politicians often lack : The public trusted him on foreign policy . But that trust began to erode with the Edward Snowden affair , it eroded further during our non-attack on Bashar al-Assad last fall , and recent events in Ukraine and Iraq have essentially made Obama’s position irrecoverable : His approval rating on foreign policy is around 35 percent in most recent polling .But this harsh judgment probably isn’t explicitly ideological : The public isn’t necessarily turning neoconservative or pining for the days of Bush . Instead , it mostly reflects a results-based verdict on what seems like poor execution , in which the White House’s slow response to ISIS is of a piece with the Obamacare rollout and the V.A . scandal and various other second-term asleep-at-the-tiller moments . It’s a problem of leadership that reflects badly on liberalism but doesn’t necessarily vindicate conservatism .And it’s because it isn’t explicitly ideological that the Democrats still have a chance in many states on Tuesday . From North Carolina to New Hampshire to Georgia , their candidates are being tugged downward by the Obama anchor , but they’re still bobbing , still only half-submerged , waiting for undecideds to break ( or just stay home ) .In many ways , Republicans have enjoyed in 2014 the kind of landscape they expected in 2012 : a landscape in which nobody save Democratic partisans particularly supports President Obama anymore . What we’re about to find out is whether , amid that disillusionment , just being the not-Obama party is enough .
THE biggest health care crisis in America right now is not the inexcusably messy rollout of Obamacare .No , far more serious is the kind of catastrophe facing people like Richard Streeter , 47 , a truck driver and recreational vehicle repairman in Eugene , Ore. His problem isnât Obamacare , but a tumor in his colon that may kill him because Obamacare didnât come quite soon enough .Streeter had health insurance for decades , but beginning in 2008 his employer no longer offered it as an option . He says he tried to buy individual health insurance but , as a lifelong smoker in his late 40s , couldnât find anything affordable â so he took a terrible chance and did without .At the beginning of this year , Streeter began to notice blood in his bowel movements and discomfort in his rectum . Because he didnât have health insurance , he put off going to the doctor and reassured himself it was just irritation from sitting too many hours .âI thought it was driving a truck and being on your keister all day , â he told me . Finally , the pain became excruciating , and he went to a cut-rate clinic where a doctor , without examining him , suggested it might be hemorrhoids .By September , Streeter couldnât stand the pain any longer . He went to another doctor , who suggested a colonoscopy . The cheapest provider he could find was Dr. J. Scott Gibson , a softhearted gastroenterologist who told him that if he didnât have insurance he would do it for $ 300 down and $ 300 more whenever he had the money .Streeter made the 100-mile drive to Dr. Gibsonâs office in McMinnville , Ore. â and received devastating news . Dr. Gibson had found advanced colon cancer .âIt was heartbreaking to see the pain on his face , â Dr. Gibson told me . âIt got me very angry with people who insist that Obamacare is a train wreck , when the real train wreck is what people are experiencing every day because they canât afford care.âDr. Gibson says that Streeter is the second patient he has had this year who put off getting medical attention because of lack of health insurance and now has advanced colon cancer .So , to those Republicans protesting Obamacare : Youâre right that there are appalling problems with the website , but they will be fixed . Likewise , youâre right that President Obama misled voters when he said that everyone could keep their insurance plan because thatâs now manifestly not true ( although they will be able to get new and better plans , sometimes for less money ) .But how about showing empathy also for a far larger and more desperate group : The nearly 50 million Americans without insurance who play health care Russian roulette as a result . FamiliesUSA , a health care advocacy group that supports Obamacare , estimated last year that an American dies every 20 minutes for lack of insurance .It has been a year since my college roommate , Scott Androes , died of prostate cancer , in part because he didnât have insurance and thus didnât see a doctor promptly . Scott fully acknowledged that he had made a terrible mistake in economizing on insurance , but , in a civilized country , is this a mistake that people should die from ?âWebsite problems are a nuisance , â Dr. Gibson said . âLife and death is when you need care and canât afford to get it.âThe Institute of Medicine and the National Research Council this year ranked the United States health care system last or near last in several categories among 17 countries studied . The Commonwealth Fund put the United States dead last of seven industrialized countries in health care performance . And Bloomberg journalists ranked the United States health care system No . 46 in efficiency worldwide , behind Romania and Iran .The reason is simple : While some Americans get superb care , tens of millions without insurance get marginal care . Thatâs one reason life expectancy is relatively low in America , and child mortality is twice as high as in some European countries . Now thatâs a scandal .Yet about half the states are refusing to expand Medicaid to cover more uninsured people â because they donât trust Obamacare and want it to fail . The result will be more catastrophes like Streeterâs .âI am tired of being the messenger of death , â said Dr. Gibson . âSometimes itâs unavoidable . But when people come in who might have been saved if they could have afforded care early on , then to have to tell them that they have a potentially fatal illness â Iâm very tired of that.âStreeter met with a radiologist on Thursday and is bracing for an arduous and impoverishing battle with the cancer . Thereâs just one bright spot : He signed up for health care insurance under Obamacare , to take effect on Jan. 1 .For him , the tragedy isnât that the Obamacare rollout has been full of glitches , but that it may have come too late to save his life .
THE first time Melissa Morelli was taken to the hospital , she was suicidal and cutting herself , her mother says . She was just 13 , and she had been transferred to a psychiatric hospital , where she stayed for more than a week . Her doctors told her mother , Cathy Morelli , that it was not safe for Melissa to go home . But the familyâs health insurance carrier would not continue to pay for her to remain in the hospital .The second time , the same thing happened . And the third and the fourth . Over the course of five months , Ms. Morelli took Melissa to the hospital roughly a dozen times , and each time the insurance company , Anthem Blue Cross , refused to pay for hospital care . âIt was just a revolving door , â Ms. Morelli said .âYou had not been getting better in a significant way , â Anthem explained in one letter sent directly to Melissa , then 14 , in July 2012. âIt does not seem likely that doing the same thing will help you get better.âDesperate to get help for her daughter , Ms. Morelli sought the assistance of Connecticut state officials and an outside reviewer . She eventually won all her appeals , and Anthem was forced to pay for the care it initially denied . All told , Melissa spent nearly 10 months in a hospital ; she is now at home . Anthem , which would not comment on Melissaâs case , says its coverage decisions are based on medical evidence .Melissaâs treatment did not come cheap : it ultimately cost hundreds of thousands of dollars , Ms. Morelli said . Patients often find themselves at odds with health insurers , but the battles are perhaps nowhere so heated as with the treatment of serious mental illness .It was not supposed to be this way . A federal law , the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 , was aimed at avoiding fights like this over coverage by making sure insurers would cover mental illnesses just as they cover treatment for diseases like cancer or multiple sclerosis .Long a priority of Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts , it was squeezed into a bank bailout bill with the help of Christopher J. Dodd , then a Democratic senator from Connecticut , after Mr. Kennedy learned that he had brain cancer , which turned out to be fatal . The law requires larger employer-based insurance plans to cover psychiatric illnesses and substance-abuse disorders in the same way they do other illnesses .But five years after President George W. Bush signed the law , there is widespread agreement that it has fallen short of its goal of creating parity for mental health coverage .As enrollment in coverage under the Affordable Care Act becomes available on Tuesday , the rules underlying mental health coverage in general â for both private insurers and the new health care exchanges â are still unclear , mental-health patient advocates say , leaving patients and families to grind through the process as best they can .DECIDING how mental illness should be treated â and at what cost â is no easy matter . Unlike some physical ailments for which there are reams of studies suggesting a relatively clear standard of care , there is often little accepted medical evidence to support the range of treatments for many mental illnesses , like schizophrenia and severe depression .âItâs very different from the approach to a bypass procedure or a hip replacement , â said Karen Ignagni , the C.E.O . of Americaâs Health Insurance Plans , a trade association representing the nationâs health insurers .At issue is not coverage for run-of-the-mill care like prescription medications for depression or a few visits with a therapist . Insurers generally cover these costs the same way they cover medications for , say , high blood pressure .But when patients need months of residential care , for example , or meetings with a therapist several times a week , insurers balk . The insurance executives say that the medical benefits of such treatments are not clear and that the industry is essentially being asked to write a blank check .Â Mental health accounts for a small part of total health care spending â by one estimate , $ 113 billion annually , or less than 6 percent of the $ 2.6 trillion overall health care bill . But pressure is intensifying on insurers under the Affordable Care Act , which includes mental heath care as an essential benefit , because they are already trying to keep the premiums they charge for plans on the new state marketplaces as low as possible . Insurers are concerned about the potential for new costs , while patient advocates worry that mental health will be neglected .Both sides say Washington is partly to blame . The federal government has yet to write the mental health actâs final regulations for insurance companies , leaving a crucial gap between the intent of the measure and how it actually works .Senator Kennedyâs son , Patrick J. Kennedy , the former congressman from Rhode Island who was one of the lawâs main backers , said he worried that the Obama administration had delayed the rules because officials were preoccupied with the presidentâs broader legislation and needed the insurance companiesâ support .President Obama âneeds the private insurers to implement this law or itâs not going to work , â said Mr. Kennedy , who has talked openly about his struggles with depression and bipolar disorder . He has held hearings on mental health issues across the country to talk to patients and their families , including one earlier this year where Cathy Morelli spoke .Insurance companies , for their part , say they would welcome final rules under the 2008 law .âWe think it may create better clarity , â said a spokeswoman for Aetna , which says it fully supports the 2008 parity law .
THE first time Obamacare seemed finished , doomed , doornail-dead , the voters of Massachusetts played the would-be executioner . In January 2010 , they sent a pickup-driving Republican to the Senate to fill Ted Kennedyâs seat , apparently depriving the health care bill of its crucial 60th vote and sending Democrats scrambling for a Plan B .Except that Plan B turned out to be Plan A , thanks to the maneuverings of Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi and the surprising stiffness of Democratic spines â and a bill that seemed undone by voter backlash went staggering across the legislative finish line instead .The second time Obamacare seemed headed for an early grave , it was the conservative justices on the Supreme Court who were was going to see it off , by following through on their oral-argument inclinations and finding the individual mandate unconstitutional .Except that Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. took the more politically cautious route instead â declining to overturn the mandate even though thatâs where his analysis seemed to point , and finding a legal via media that kept the health care law limping toward implementation .Now weâve reached Obamacareâs third near-death experience , and if the law actually goes down this time there will be a lot of fingerprints on the murder weapon : Kathleen Sebelius and her hapless crew of Internet engineers ; the voters infuriated at being thrown from their existing coverage into the not-really-working exchanges ; panicking Congressional Democrats and gleeful Congressional Republicans ; the media , long favorably disposed to the project but now scenting second-term blood ; and of course the president himself , whose ânoble lieâ that everyone could keep their coverage has made the backlash that much worse .But the deeper force at work , the reason that these near-death experiences keep happening , isnât a website or a broken presidential promise . Itâs a problem inherent to contemporary liberalism , which is that liberalsâ proudest achievement , the modern welfare state , tends to resist , corrupt and baffle their efforts at comprehensive reform .This was the message of Jonathan Rauchâs book âGovernmentâs End , â which was first published in the Clinton era , and which Iâve recommended before as essential to understanding liberalismâs struggles in the Obama years . Because our government spends and regulates so much , Rauch argued , because its influence sprawls into so many walks of life , because so many clients and beneficiaries and interest groups depend on its programs and policies , the policy status quo is far harder to dislodge today than it was during the Progressive Era or the New Deal or the Great Society .This status quo bias is structural rather than ideological ; it frustrates limited-government conservatives as well as liberal technocrats . But the frustration has been much more acute and ironic for Democrats , who find themselves handcuffed by the very achievements they aspire to emulate , and attacked by the beneficiaries of yesterdayâs liberal programs when they attempt to propose programs for tomorrow .Up to a point , these are realities the Obama White House seemed to grasp , which is why theyâve gotten further with health care reform than Bill Clinton did in 1993 . From a political perspective , both the complexity of Obamacareâs interlocking mandates , subsidies and regulations and the disingenuous promises that accompanied its passage were arguably design features rather than bugs â intended to buy off , to appease , to burden-spread and cost-conceal and generally reassure everyone just long enough to get the system up and running .But the White Houseâs cleverness had inevitable limits , which is why the law keeps facing backlash in fresh places , and why the media keep getting the chance to prepare Obamacareâ obituaries . And whatâs going on right now , the convergence of the websiteâs technical problems with the backlash surrounding canceled plans , reveals the perils of trying to outsmart the political systemâs status quo bias . Your strategy can end up so intricate and deceptive , and your policy so complex and jerry-built , that something as basic as a malfunctioning website can suffice to bring the whole policy crashing down .The welfare stateâs ability to defend itself against reform , however , carries a cautionary message for Obamacareâs critics as well . What isnât killed outright grows stronger the longer itâs embedded in the federal apparatus , gaining constituents and interest-group support just by virtue of its existence even if it doesnât work out the way it was designed . And as disastrous as its launch has been , if the health care law can survive this crisis in the same limping , staggering way it survived Scott Brown and the Supremes , then it will be a big step closer to being part of the status quo , with all the privileges and political strength that entails .So yes â itâs possible that this brush with death will be fatal , possible that the law will fall with the lightest , most politically painless push . But itâs still likely that Obamacare will be undone only if its critics are willing to do something more painful , and take their own turn wrestling with a system that resists any kind of change .
THE problems with our countryâs political discourse are many and grave , but an insufficient attention to Obamacare isnât among them . We have talked Obamacare to death , or at least into home hospice care . The âObamacareâ shorthand itself reflects our need to come up with less of a mouthful than âPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act , â given how regularly the topic recurs . âObamacareâ is like âJ . Loâ or âKFC.â It saves syllables and speeds things along .So explain this : according to a recent poll , roughly 40 percent of Americans donât even know that itâs a law on the books .Now if I learned that 40 percent werenât aware of when Obamacare was to be fully implemented or whether any of it had yet gone into practice or precisely how itâs likely to affect them , I wouldnât be surprised or distressed . Obamacare is nothing if not unwieldy and opaque : âUlyssesâ meets âMulholland Drive.â The people confused about it include no small number of the physicians I know and probably a few of the lawâs authors to boot .But 40 percent of Americans are clueless about its sheer existence . Some think itâs been repealed by Congress . Some think itâs been overturned by the Supreme Court . A few probably think itâs been vaporized and replaced with a galactic edict beamed down from one of Saturnâs moons . With Americans you never know .According to a survey I stumbled across just weeks ago , 21 percent believe that a U.F.O . landed in Roswell , N.M. , nearly seven decades ago and that the federal government hushed it up , while 14 percent believe in Bigfoot .According to another survey , taken last year , about 65 percent of us canât name a single Supreme Court justice . Not the chief one , John Roberts . Not the mute one , Clarence Thomas . Not even the mean one , Antonin Scalia . Though when it comes to Scalia , perhaps the body politic suffers less from ignorance than from repressed memory .That we Americans are out to lunch isnât news . But every once in a while a fresh factoid like the Obamacare ignorance comes along to remind us that weâre out to breakfast and dinner as well . And it adds an important , infrequently acknowledged bit of perspective to all the commentary , from us journalists and from political strategists alike , about how voters behave and whom they reward . We purport to interpret an informed , rational universe , because weâd undercut our own insights if we purported anything else .But only limited sense can be made of what is often nonsensical , and the truth is that a great big chunk of the electorate is tuned out , zonked out or combing Roswell for alien remains . Polls over the last few years have variously shown that about 30 percent of us couldnât name the vice president , about 35 percent couldnât assign the proper century to the American Revolution and 6 percent couldnât circle Independence Day on a calendar . Iâm supposing that the 6 percent werenât also given the holidayâs synonym , the Fourth of July . Iâm an optimist through and through .Hereâs one of my favorite findings : in a poll in 2011 , after intense , closely chronicled fiscal battles in California , a sampling of the stateâs residents were quizzed about which category of spending accounted for the biggest share of Californiaâs budget . Only 16 percent correctly said public education through the 12th grade . And they did this poorly in spite of being given just four possible answers , including the correct one , from which to choose . They more or less underperformed the odds .Apart from perennial news stories about how many Americans would flunk the citizenship test that immigrants must pass , we mostly gloss over our ignorance or deny it . Election analysts are constantly saying that voters are âtoo smartâ for some ploy or âsmarter thanâ they get credit for being .And thereâs a whole subgenre of nonfiction that assures us that we shouldnât be spooked by how uneducated we are . âThe Wisdom of Crowdsâ suggests that if enough bumbling people act in concert , theyâll find their way to a less bumbling place , while âBlinkâ portrays snap judgments as the fruits of an information intake that isnât easily measured but is meaningful nonetheless . Thereâs âEmotional Intelligenceâ as well as nuts-and-bolts knowledge , and we can be guided , profitably , by it .I buy some of that . Iâve talked to enough voters over enough elections to recognize that their flabby impressions arenât always antonyms of concrete information but instead cruder , lesser versions of it , colored if not governed by facts that theyâve picked up in a peripheral , semiconscious fashion .Still . In 2010 in California , I covered a Tea Party rally at which Carly Fiorina , vying for the Republican nomination for a United States Senate seat , was scheduled to speak . I approached a couple whose profusion of hats and buttons and handmade signs â along with their willingness to spend hours in a crowded field under a punishing sun â led me to believe that they were at least somewhat politically engaged . I asked them if they were inclined to support Fiorina . With great seriousness , they said that they hadnât yet decided between her and Meg Whitman . Whitman was running not for senator but for governor , in a race that hardly wanted for coverage . They didnât have to choose .At a heated point of the 2012 presidential primaries , when both Rick Santorum and the news media were making much of his faith and fecundity , less than 30 percent of voters could identify his religious affiliation as Catholic , according to one poll.Â Months later a different poll asked adults about President Obamaâs religious affiliation , persistently mistaken by some Americans to be Muslim . Lamentably , 18 percent still thought Mr. Obama was Muslim â pretty much unchanged from the 17 percent who thought he was Muslim when the same poll asked the question two years earlier .Itâs possible , of course , that respondents just mess with pollstersâ heads . Heâs a Seventh-day Adventist ! Heâs a Scientologist ! But too many surveys over too many years show too much abject ignorance for the phenomenon to be belittled or dismissed . Whatâs more , thereâs no consoling arc over time , no trajectory of progress . Wherever the Internet is speeding us , itâs not toward greater civic erudition and enlightenment .Into the vacuum of substantive knowledge rush the unprincipled advertisements , the unctuous hucksters , the âsuper PACs , â the Swift boating , the Sunday-morning-talk-show spin . A clueless electorate is a corruptible one , and one that seems ill poised to make the smartest , best call about something as sweeping as Obamacare and how it gets tweaked or not down the line . Maybe weâll blink our way to the right decisions . Or maybe weâll just stumble around with our eyes closed .
THIS is not the column about the Obamacare rollout I expected to write .If you had told me , months ago , that weeks after the health care lawâs coverage expansion went into effect I would be writing about the problems its launch had exposed , I would have assumed Iâd be writing about rate shock , rising premiums and the disappearance of many cheap insurance plans â basically , all the problems conservatives have worried will make Obamacare a ruinously expensive failure if they play out as we fear they might .I may be writing about those issues soon enough . But for now there is a more pressing subject : The online federal health care exchange , the heart of the Obamacare project , is such a rolling catastrophe that it may end up creating a major policy fiasco immediately rather than eventually .This fiasco has always been a possibility , for reasons inherent in the architecture of the law . When The New Republicâs Jonathan Cohn , the most rigorous defender of the entire reform project , wrote up his âfive Obamacare anxietiesâ in May , the first one was structural : The systemâs sustainability depends on getting enough healthy people to sign up , he pointed out , and if they donât then insurers âwill have to raise everyoneâs premiums , â which âcould create what actuaries call a âdeath spiralâ : Rising premiums prompt people to drop out , causing premiums to increase even more.âCohn thought such a death spiral was unlikely , and frankly so did I . Between the stick of the mandate , the carrot of subsidies and the planned P.R . blitz , it seemed as if enough Americans would sign up to at least postpone the cost problem and get the system off the ground .But it seemed that way because it was hard to imagine the Obama White House botching the design and execution of its national health care exchange .

THIS was the week when liberals decided that it was safe to feel optimistic about Obamacare again .Not , mind you , because the websiteâs flaws have all been wiped away , or because the pace of enrollment is where the White House wanted it to be , or because the political backlash over plan cancellations has disappeared . The site may be better , the enrollment pace higher , the backlash no longer front-page news â but the lawâs rollout is by any reasonable definition still a dreadful mess .But a worst-case scenario , in which the website remained unusable well into the new year , seems to have been averted , and with it the danger that insurers or Congressional Democrats would begin to bail on Obamacare entirely .And liberals have apparently decided that just getting things moving in the right direction makes all the difference . Sure , problems persist , crucial errors remain , and confusion probably looms for some customers and insurers in January , when policies are supposed to take effect . But errors can be fixed , money sluiced around , more temporary changes made . The important thing is there will be no immediate political unraveling ... which means that enrollment will keep rising ... which means that by 2016 , Obamacare will be a locked-in , impossible-to-repeal feature of the American landscape .This holds true , liberals have begun telling themselves , even if the lawâs disruptions cost Democrats dearly in the 2014 midterms . Because a working website will give the White House âthree full years to create millions , and perhaps tens of millions , of winners who are getting insurance or protection , â The Washington Postâs Ezra Klein wrote last week , Democrats can âlose on the politics in the midterm election even as they win on the policy in the long term.âThe entrenchment hypothesis is plausible . But it elides one crucial problem : the extent to which the successful implementation of Obamacare actuallyÂ dependsÂ on the lawâs political standing.ÂThatâs because the law can work only if people who donât necessarily benefit immediately from its provisions decide to participate anyway . If they respond to higher premiums by either staying out or dropping out , then Obamacare will be permanently unstable : the dollar figures , both for insurers and the government , simply wonât add up .The participation of the young and healthy is supposed to be required , of course , by the individual mandate . But the mandateâs penalty is relatively modest and its enforcement mechanisms relatively weak , which means its power ultimately depends more on civic duty than on immediate self-interest .The lawâs advocates have explicitly acknowledged this point . Explaining the case for the mandate last month , The Atlanticâs Matt OâBrien allowed that âa rational self-maximizerâ might decide to pay the fine instead of buying costly coverage . But âreal people , â he argued , âarenât rational self-maximizers ... We donât like to feel like weâre doing the wrong thing . We like to follow the rules instead . Feel like weâre a good person.âThe experience of Mitt Romneyâs Massachusetts , OâBrien concluded , shows how this works : enrollment in Romneycare spiked when the mandate kicked in , and it spiked for healthy people â presumably because they accepted the âpositive responsibilityâ of the mandate , and bought health insurance because itâs what they were âsupposed to do.âBut this example does not necessarily bode well for Obamacareâs unfolding . The Massachusetts law was a bipartisan bill passed in a wealthy , homogeneous state with a pervasive left-liberal ethos . The national health care law aspires to create the same sense of âpositive responsibilityâ in a much more polarized , fragmented , socioeconomically diverse and libertarian-minded society , roughly half of which opposes the law outright .This was always going to be a lift even without technological problems and âif you like your plan , you can keep your planâ disillusionment . Now itâs much , much heavier .Consider the findings of a new poll from Harvardâs Institute of Politics . Among the traditionally pro-Obama millennial generation , the core group that the White House needs to âfollow the rulesâ and buy a policy , the presidentâs approval ratings have dropped to 41 percent , and support for Obamacare has also plunged : 56 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds disapprove of the law , a majority say it will increase costs , and just 18 percent say it will improve their care . Meanwhile , a new National Journal survey finds that a majority of millennials expect the law to be repealed outright .Those are not numbers that suggest a population thatâs poised to fall in line , do its civic duty , and feel warm and fuzzy in the process . Rather , they suggest that the political emotions stirred up by the rollout â frustration , disillusionment , anger â could have substantial consequences for sign-up rates as well .âIf thereâs one thing we know how to do , â said a White House official last spring , projecting optimism about Obamacare enrollment , âitâs reach young people.âNow , though , the fate of their policy may depend on not only reaching them , but reconverting them as well .
TO THE EDITOR:Re âObamacare , Retooledâ ( Economic View , Oct. 20 ) , in which Tyler Cowen described how he thought the Affordable Care Act might be revised in ways that both political parties could endorse:I stopped at this sentence , where Professor Cowen noted assumptions that each party would have to make if revisions were to work : âIâll also assume that Republicans will acknowledge that a feasible rewrite of the bill can not give the Democrats nothing.âAt that point , the column became a waste of time for me . After all , we have just come through a 16-day shutdown of government and a near-default because of the Republican Partyâs continued opposition to Obamacare . While many of that partyâs elected officials have acknowledged that this is not the time to defund or eliminate Obamacare , who among them has acknowledged the need for its continued existence ? Isnât their attitude the same as giving the Democrats ânothingâ ?MARK STACKHOUSEDRESHER , PA. , OCT. 20
TORONTO — Canadian computer services provider CGI Group Inc , the contractor behind the troubled Obamacare enrollment website , reported weaker-than-expected quarterly results on Wednesday , sending its shares to a four-month low .The Montreal-based company said revenue and bookings - an indicator of future sales - were both strong in its first quarter despite losing the contract to manage the U.S. federal healthcare enrollment website it helped build .But it also reported U.S. margin pressure and said cash from operations slipped to C $ 66 million ( $ 59.19 million ) , down from C $ 224.5 million a year earlier . It blamed delays in collecting payments on some contracts as well as a hit from payments related to the integration of former British competitor Logica , which it bought more than a year ago to expand its European presence .The company said it expects both of those problems to be temporary and predicted cash generation of around C $ 300 million per quarter in coming quarters . CGI said it generated more than C $ 800 million in cash from operations over the previous 12 months , excluding Logica integration costs .It also said that revenue - which would have shrunk if not for advantageous currency rates - was pressured by a deliberate move away from low-margin business , and that costs in the United States rose as it pushed to hit year-end targets .The stock was down 4 percent at C $ 33.81 on the Toronto Stock Exchange at midmorning on Wednesday after falling as low as C $ 32.71 , its lowest point since early September .`` All things considered I see this is a buying opportunity and I 'm still positive on the stock , '' said Thanos Moschopoulos , an analyst at BMO Capital Markets .`` But I 'd say the quarter was mixed because I liked the bookings , I liked the revenue performance , I liked management 's tone on the call , but it does seem that EPS ( earnings per share ) estimates for the Street are likely to come down a little . ''CGI has attracted the attention of short-seller Jim Chanos , who warned last month the company 's high-profile troubles could hurt its ability to win government contracts and said the Logica acquisition hid deteriorating fundamentals .PLAGUED BY ERROR MESSAGESThe U.S. healthcare.gov site was plagued by error messages and slow speeds for weeks after its launch , creating a political headache for the White House .The U.S. government said earlier this month that Accenture had been chosen to replace CGI Federal as lead contractor for the Obamacare enrollment website .`` ( We ) have not seen any impact on our ability to conduct or grow our business '' from the website 's problems , CGI CEO Michael Roach told investors and analysts on a conference call .He said the company is still involved in managing six state-based health exchanges , with some performing better than others .CGI still managed to increase its backlog of orders in the quarter and announced a plan that gives it the option to buy back up to 10 percent of its shares in the next year .The company said it booked C $ 2.8 billion worth of contracts in the quarter , almost half of it new business , for a book-to-bill ratio of 107 percent .Book-to-bill refers to the ratio of orders added to the company 's backlog versus finished work that can be billed to a client . Investors are keen to see the company get orders for more work than it finishes each quarter , as this points to growth .CGI 's backlog of signed orders rose by C $ 972 million to stand at C $ 19.3 billion at the end of December .One-third of the bookings were for government customers , with almost a quarter for manufacturers , retailers and distributors , the company said . More than a quarter came from the United States , but a broad range of geographies were represented .The company had a net profit of C $ 189.8 million , or 60 Canadian cents a share . It said revenue rose 4.4 percent to C $ 2.64 billion .Excluding Logica integration costs , CGI said it made C $ 207.9 million , or 65 Canadian cents a share , compared with C $ 137.8 million , or 44 cents a share , a year earlier .Analysts had on average had expected CGI to earn 70 Canadian cents a share on revenue of C $ 2.64 billion , according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S .( $ 1= $ 1.11 Canadian )( Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe , Chizu Nomiyama , Jeffrey Hodgson and Peter Galloway )
TWO beliefs continue to shape debate on Obamacare . First , pre-existing medical conditions shouldnât prevent people from obtaining affordable health insurance . And second , people who donât want health insurance shouldnât be forced by the government to purchase it .These may seem to be reasonable positions . But they are incompatible . Thatâs been shown by historical events , and itâs now being strikingly confirmed by recent experience in the emerging Obamacare insurance exchanges .The crux of the matter is what economists call the adverse-selection problem . Uninsured people with pre-existing conditions often face tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket medical costs annually . If insurers charged everyone the same rate , buying coverage would be far more attractive financially for people with chronic illnesses than for healthy people . And as healthy policyholders began dropping out of the insured pool , it would become increasingly composed of sick people , forcing insurers to raise their rates .But higher rates make insurance even less attractive for healthy people , causing even more of them to drop out . Before long , coverage would become too expensive for almost everyone .The adverse-selection problem explains why almost no countries leave health care provision to unregulated private insurance markets . It also predicts that requiring private insurance companies to charge the same rates to everyone will make it prohibitively expensive for most people to buy individual health insurance .In the 1990s , lawmakers in New York State enacted just such a requirement , and the result was exactly as predicted . Rates for individual policies soared , making New Yorkersâ insurance among the most expensive in the nation . Now , rates quoted under the Obamacare exchanges place individual policies within reach for millions of New Yorkers . New York City residents who had been paying $ 1,000 a month for individual policies in the earlier environment , for example , will now be able to purchase similar coverage on the Obamacare exchanges for slightly more than $ 300 a month .Whatâs changed ? Insurers are able to offer more reasonable rates because the individual mandate â the requirement in Obamacare that everyone buy insurance or face financial penalties â is ensuring a high proportion of healthy people in the insured pool .Early quotes for individual policies on the exchanges in several other states have exhibited a similar pattern . Thatâs true in California , for example , and in Maryland , the latest state to report , rates now compare favorably with those in employer group plans .Despite this experience , many in Congress want to repeal the individual mandate . Some , such as Senator Marco Rubio of Florida , have even threatened to shut down the government unless Obamacare is repealed entirely .What alternatives are there ? One way of avoiding the adverse-selection problem would be to re-emphasize traditional employer-provided health plans . Adverse selection is less serious under such plans , because the favorable tax treatment they receive requires insurers to cover all employees irrespective of pre-existing conditions . ( Insurers can meet the requirement because most people employed in any company are reasonably healthy . )But Obamacare was enacted precisely because employer plans fell short in many other ways . Millions of people , for example , are ineligible for such plans because they donât have jobs . And millions of others with chronic health problems are trapped in their current jobs , because leaving them would mean losing coverage .Employer plans arose in the first place only because of a loophole created by wage controls during World War II . In an effort to curb the costs of the war effort , the government prohibited wage increases but , perhaps by oversight , did not prevent employers from offering additional fringe benefits as a way to combat labor shortages . Employer health plans proved an especially effective recruiting tool and had the additional advantage of not being taxed as implicit income .BUT if universal access to health care is the goal , employer plans are not the solution . Because global competition has increased pressure to cut costs , the number of workers with such plans has been steadily declining for more than 40 years .The challenge was to design a new system that could cover the more than 50 million Americans without health insurance . The Medicare-for-all proposal favored by many health economists was one approach that the administration considered .But that approach would have required Americans to abandon their existing employer plans for something new and unfamiliar . In the light of survey evidence that most Americans were reasonably satisfied with their existing plans , itâs hard to second-guess President Obamaâs conclusion that this step would have been politically infeasible .The only remaining option was to supplement existing employer plans with regulated private insurance markets . This approach had been carried out successfully in Switzerland , and in Massachusetts under Mitt Romney when he was governor . Individual mandates were an essential ingredient of that strategy . And given that many people could not afford to purchase insurance , it was also necessary to include subsidies for low-income buyers .Obamacare , in any event , is now the law of the land . Even its most ardent supporters concede that the program will need to be amended as experience accumulates . But evidence from the emerging insurance exchanges vindicates the basic policy choices underlying the legislation .We must ask those who would repeal Obamacare how they propose to solve the adverse-selection problem . That problem is not an abstraction invented by economists to justify trampling individual liberties . As experience in most countries around the world has confirmed , it is a profound source of market failure that renders unregulated insurance markets a catastrophically ineffective way of providing access to health care .
Terrific piece in the WaPo on how Kentucky’s rural poor are being helped by Kynect , the state’s version of Obamacare , which has had a picture-perfect rollout .This is why we need health reform .To my misfortune , I accidentally read some of the comments , which which full of scorn verging on hatred for the “moochers” getting access to decent medical care for the first time . What can you say ? I assume that these people root for President Snow against Katniss , too .Anyway , this is what it is all about . And it’s ready to happen . It’s well underway in California , Connecticut , moving along in New York , and is just a technical fix — a tough fix , but obviously doable — away for the nation as a whole .Stay with it .

That didn’t take long .Senator Harry Reid’s office this morning took a shot at Senator Mitch McConnell , the incoming majority leader , under the subject line : “Senator McConnell vows more of the same.”The reference was to an op-ed article by Mr. McConnell and House Speaker John A. Boehner published this morning in The Wall Street Journal in which they said they would fulfill voters’ expectations by “renewing our commitment to repeal ObamaCare , which is hurting the job market along with Americans’ health care.”Mr. Reid’s press office noted that “one day after the election Senator McConnell is already letting Senator Cruz set the agenda , ” referring to Senator Ted Cruz of Texas , the very conservative Republican who led last year’s government shutdown and has said Republicans should do whatever they can to overturn the law .“Conspicuously absent from Senator McConnell’s vision for the next Congress : the word ‘compromise’ , ” said the email from Adam Jentleson , Mr. Reid’s spokesman .Republicans have said they will try to overturn the law when they take power in January , but they also say they know they can not win since President Obama would veto any repeal they could get through Congress .It’s not going to be easy for Mr. McConnell , who not only was being hit by Democrats for quickly reneging on talk of trying to work together but by conservatives upset that in remarks Wednesday , Mr. McConnell took the weapons of a government shutdown or threat of default off the table .
The Affordable Care Act , a k a Obamacare , goes fully into effect at the beginning of next year , and predictions of disaster are being heard far and wide . There will be an administrative âtrain wreck , â weâre told ; consumers will face a terrible shock . Republicans , one hears , are already counting on the lawâs troubles to give them a big electoral advantage .No doubt there will be problems , as there are with any large new government initiative , and in this case , we have the added complication that many Republican governors and legislators are doing all they can to sabotage reform . Yet important new evidence â especially from California , the lawâs most important test case â suggests that the real Obamacare shock will be one of unexpected success .Before I can explain what the news means , I need to make a crucial point : Obamacare is a deeply conservative reform , not in a political sense ( although it was originally a Republican proposal ) but in terms of leaving most peopleâs health care unaffected . Americans who receive health insurance from their employers , Medicare or Medicaid â which is to say , the vast majority of those who have any kind of health insurance at all â will see almost no changes when the law goes into effect .There are , however , millions of Americans who donât receive insurance either from their employers or from government programs . They can get insurance only by buying it on their own , and many of them are effectively shut out of that market . In some states , like California , insurers reject applicants with past medical problems . In others , like New York , insurers canât reject applicants , and must offer similar coverage regardless of personal medical history ( âcommunity ratingâ ) ; unfortunately , this leads to a situation in which premiums are very high because only those with current health problems sign up , while healthy people take the risk of going uninsured .Obamacare closes this gap with a three-part approach . First , community rating everywhere â no more exclusion based on pre-existing conditions . Second , the âmandateâ â you must buy insurance even if youâre currently healthy . Third , subsidies to make insurance affordable for those with lower incomes .Massachusetts has had essentially this system since 2006 ; as a result , nearly all residents have health insurance , and the program remains very popular . So we know that Obamacare â or , as some of us call it , ObamaRomneyCare â can work .Skeptics argued , however , that Massachusetts was special : it had relatively few uninsured residents even before the reform , and it already had community rating . What would happen elsewhere ? In particular , what would happen in California , where more than a fifth of the nonelderly population is uninsured , and the individual insurance market is largely unregulated ? Would there be âsticker shockâ as the price of individual policies soared ?Well , the California bids are in â that is , insurers have submitted the prices at which they are willing to offer coverage on the stateâs newly created Obamacare exchange . And the prices , it turns out , are surprisingly low . A handful of healthy people may find themselves paying more for coverage , but it looks as if Obamacareâs first year in California is going to be an overwhelmingly positive experience .What can still go wrong ? Well , Obamacare is a complicated program , basically because simpler options , like Medicare for all , werenât considered politically feasible . So there will probably be a lot of administrative confusion as the law goes into effect , again especially in states where Republicans have been doing their best to sabotage the process .Also , some people are too poor to afford coverage even with the subsidies . These Americans were supposed to be covered by a federally financed expansion of Medicaid , but in states where Republicans have blocked Medicaid expansion , such unfortunates will be left out in the cold .Still , hereâs what it seems is about to happen : millions of Americans will suddenly gain health coverage , and millions more will feel much more secure knowing that such coverage is available if they lose their jobs or suffer other misfortunes . Only a relative handful of people will be hurt at all . And as contrasts emerge between the experience of states like California that are making the most of the new policy and that of states like Texas whose politicians are doing their best to undermine it , the sheer meanspiritedness of the Obamacare opponents will become ever more obvious .So yes , it does look as if thereâs an Obamacare shock coming : the shock of learning that a public program designed to help a lot of people can , strange to say , end up helping a lot of people â especially when government officials actually try to make it work .
The Affordable Care Act , aka Obamacare , is a policy Rube Goldberg device — instead of doing the simple , obvious thing , which would just be to insure everyone , it basically relies on a combination of regulations and subsidies to rope , coddle , and nudge us into a rough approximation of a single-payer system . There were reasons for this , of course , mainly political : a complete displacement of the existing system would have been both too destructive of powerful interests and too radical for voters .Still , the question is whether this cobbled-together system will work , and there have been many conservatives rubbing their hands with glee over the prospect of failure .Whoops .We won’t really know how Obamacare works until it has been in operation for a while ; but we do know that essentially the same system has been running in Massachusetts since 2006 , and is doing pretty well . The question , then , is whether other states that don’t have MA’s initial advantages — especially an already low uninsurance rate and an already operating system of community rating — can make this thing work . The big fear has been of sharply rising premiums as insurers are required to cover people with preexisting conditions . And the biggest test case was always going to be California .Well , the preliminary numbers for CA are in — and they’re looking very good , with costs coming in below expectations . At this point , it looks as if this thing is indeed going to work .And think about the political dynamics . Because the Supreme Court decided to let states opt out of the Medicaid expansion , some states — notably Texas — will have a pretty dysfunctional version of Obamacare in 2014 , although even those systems will provide significant benefits to many people . Still , the whole political calculus was supposed to be that Republicans in red states could point to the horrors of Obamacare and ride them to political victory . Instead , it looks as if we’re going to see blue-state residents reaping the benefits of a functional health care system , while red-state residents are denied many of those benefits , for what looks like no better reason than mean-spirited spite — because what’s going on is , indeed , mean-spirited spite .Predictions that Obamacare will be a big political issue are probably right — but not in the way gleeful conservatives imagined .
