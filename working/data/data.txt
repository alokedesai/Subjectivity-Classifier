1	"( Reuters ) - A few U.S. states whose newly created Obamacare insurance exchanges were stalled by technology failures may join the federal government 's HealthCare.gov marketplace for next year , while only two states that relied on the administration plan to go it alone .Exchange officials in Oregon , Maryland and Massachusetts are weighing whether to enlist new private technology contractors or to turn to the federal government after faulty exchanges slowed enrollment in their states to the lowest rates in the country .The reshuffle would mean the federal government would continue to remain responsible for enrolling millions of people in coverage under President Barack Obama 's healthcare law in most of the country next year , a far cry from its goal of independent marketplaces in all 50 states .Of the 36 states that signed up residents via HealthCare.gov for 2014 , Idaho and New Mexico say they will run their own online enrollment for 2015 , according to spokespeople in those states . Enrollment for next year begins in November .Political opposition to the law in many states prevented the creation of more state-based exchanges and has continued to threaten the program . Republicans have sought to defund it , even shutting down the government last year in an attempt to do so .`` I do n't have any indication that the feds are pushing back , except I know that it has to be in their interest to have the states running as many state marketplaces as possible , '' said Linda Blumberg , a health economist at the Urban Institute .Blumberg drew a distinction between states like Idaho , which relied on the federal government solely for its technology platform but oversaw bigger aspects of its marketplace , including enrollment outreach and regulation of the insurance plans sold in the state . Other states using HealthCare.gov have left oversight of virtually their entire marketplace to the Department of Health and Human Services .`` I think they 'd be very happy if Illinois became a state-based marketplace , but I do n't think it has to do necessarily with the IT system , '' she said , referring to a state that has relied on the federal government for more than technology .The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services , the U.S. government agency responsible for overseeing the exchanges , did not have an immediate comment on the possible moves .`` CMS is committed to providing technical assistance and feedback to state-based marketplaces , '' CMS spokesman Aaron Albright said . `` We are working closely with states to support their efforts to successfully implement their marketplace . ''EXCHANGE IN A BOXState-run exchanges have a few options to consider for fixing their problems before turning to the federal government .Connecticut , a state whose exchange worked mostly smoothly in the first year of Obamacare enrollment , has had discussions with five states about selling its technology as an `` exchange in a box , '' the head of its exchange said . It could handle an entire exchange , or just do the back-office work of calculating government subsidies for individual Obamacare plans and sending transaction forms to insurers .`` States pretty much have to make a decision now , '' Kevin Counihan , Access Health CT chief executive officer , said earlier this month .Beyond 2015 , the picture starts to blur . Arkansas and Illinois are considering building their own exchanges but have no definite plans for 2016 .`` It is somewhat unclear whether more states will move in the direction of running their own marketplaces , '' said Jennifer Tolbert , director of state health reform at the Kaiser Family Foundation . `` We may need a little more time for things to settle out . ''States that are already using HealthCare.gov , which started off severely hobbled by technology problems , have a reason to stay now that it is working well enough , she said . As many as 6 million people are expected to sign up by the time 2014 enrollment ends on March 31 , with the number surging to 22 million by 2016 .States that run their own marketplaces receive hundreds of millions of dollars in startup money from the federal government to build the exchanges , but after that they bear the financial responsibility and must prove they can operate at a self-sustaining level within a short time .Idaho and New Mexico had always intended to run their own exchanges but were caught short in planning and last spring said the federal government would sell their plans on HealthCare.gov . Both states have contracted with small , privately held Silicon Valley technology firm GetInsured to build their individual state marketplaces in time for 2015 . The company also runs an online health insurance marketplace , Getinsured.com .In Hawaii , a state whose exchange technology did not work for many months , keeping enrollment to a trickle , officials said the state would stay the course as a stand-alone exchange .Hawaii is not considering the Connecticut offering or moving to the federal marketplace , since its exchange has been constructed to meet the requirements of its state health laws , spokesman Bobby Lambrix said in a statement .If Oregon , Massachusetts or Maryland decide on a federal option , it is likely to be just technology and not a wholesale shift , said Chad Shearer , deputy director of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundations ' state health reform assistance network .`` It 's almost as hard to go the federally facilitated marketplace as it is to fix what they 've got , '' he said . `` I think states are interested in using pieces of the ( federal ) technology .

1	"( Reuters ) - A gay couple in Ohio filed a federal lawsuit on Tuesday , charging they were unable to obtain family coverage under President Barack Obama 's healthcare reform law because the state of Ohio does not recognize their same-sex marriage .The plaintiffs , Alfred Cowger and Anthony Wesley of Gates Mills , Ohio , have been together since 1986 and were married in New York state in 2012 , six years after adopting a daughter , according to the suit filed in U.S. District Court in Ohio .The suit names the U.S. government and the state of Ohio as defendants , charging they violated the plaintiffs ' constitutional rights by refusing to recognize their married status , thereby preventing them from enrolling in family coverage under the Affordable Care Act , commonly known as Obamacare .The plaintiffs said they had been covered under the same policy for the past 15 years , which included their recognition as `` domestic partners . '' Their daughter also became covered under their policy at the time they were granted custody in 2006 .After the family moved to the Cleveland area from Pennsylvania in 2010 , the three were covered under the same non-group family health insurance policy purchased from Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Ohio .With Cowger starting to scale back his law practice in early 2013 and Wesley retired from his job as a chief financial officer , the couple faced reduced income and became interested in family coverage under the Affordable Care Act .After initially being unable to enroll in Obamacare because of glitches involving the troubled rollout of the healthcare.gov website , they said in the suit that they were assured by Anthem they could remain under its policy after December 2013 , although premiums would increase by about 20 percent .But in November , according to the suit , Cowger said he received a letter from Anthem stating their policy `` was to be terminated because it was not in compliance with the ACA . ''A new family policy with Anthem would cost about twice their existing one , or about half the family 's joint income , and not be eligible for tax credits under Obamacare .'NOT DEEMED VALID 'Cowger said he returned to the ACA marketplace and logged some 100 hours trying to obtain family coverage . He said in the suit he was repeatedly told by marketplace representatives that he and his spouse should be able to obtain a family policy because they were legally married in New York and planned to file a joint 2013 tax return .`` However , each time , Cowger would ultimately be told that it was determined that plaintiffs could not purchase a family policy since their legal marriage in New York , recognized as valid for federal tax purposes , was not deemed valid to obtain a family policy under the ACA , '' the suit said .Ultimately facing the loss of all health coverage at the end of 2013 , Cowger and Wesley were forced to obtain separate individual health insurance policies from the marketplace , their lawsuit said .The inability of Cowger and Wesley to get family coverage under Obamacare created further complications that also ultimately required them to get a separate policy for their daughter , the suit said .`` As a result , the Cowger-Wesley family went from one family policy in 2013 to three different individual policies , '' it added .Ohio state officials could not immediately be reached for comment .U.S. Health and Human Services spokeswoman Joanne Peters said in a statement : `` We are aware that same-sex married couples in some states are experiencing issues in obtaining family plans and ( are ) looking into ways to address this issue for the 2015 plan year . ''`` While we work to address this situation , same-sex married couples can use their tax credit to buy individual policies for each spouse if they are unable to obtain a family plan in their current state , '' she said .( Reporting by Peter Cooney , editing by G Crosse )"
1	"( Reuters ) - A stand-off between Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana and the federal government over healthcare coverage for people with HIV-AIDS escalated on Monday , as a gay-rights group filed a legal complaint against the insurer , which reiterated a policy at odds with federal regulations .Lambda Legal , a non-profit that works for the civil rights of gay people and others , filed an administrative complaint against Louisiana Blue , saying the company 's stance `` violates critical non-discrimination provisions of the Affordable Care Act '' or ACA , President Barack Obama 's healthcare reform law .Reuters reported on Saturday that hundreds of people with HIV/AIDS in Louisiana who purchased health insurance under the ACA are at risk of being thrown out of the plans they selected . The customers had paid their premiums with funds from a federal program that , for 23 years , has subsidized insurance for people with HIV-AIDS , but Louisiana Blue Cross said it would not accept those checks because any third-party payments opened the door to fraud .Over the weekend , the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , the lead Obamacare agency , issued stronger guidance on whether insurers must accept payments from the 1990 Ryan White Act program . CMS said it is considering going beyond `` encouraging '' insurers to accept Ryan White funds to pay for health care plans to `` requiring '' them to do so .On Monday , Louisiana Blue repeated its opposition to accepting payments from the Ryan White program for policies it sells through Healthcare.gov , the Obamacare portal .The insurer has `` received the latest communication '' from CMS , said Louisiana Blue spokesman John Maginnis , but for now `` our policy is that effective March 1 , 2014 , we will only accept individual members ' premium payments from the policyholder , '' or an immediate relative , and `` will no longer accept third-party payments . ''`` There are very few of our individual members who will be affected by this , '' he said .Lucy Cordts of the New Orleans NO/AIDS Task Force , which has been scrambling to help affected Louisiana Blue customers , said several hundred people with HIV-AIDS had used Ryan White payments for their monthly premiums and could be kicked out of the Obamacare plan they purchased .Of the hundreds of people with HIV-AIDS who are trying to use Ryan White Act funds to pay Obamacare insurance premiums , many are too poor to qualify for ACA subsidies , which go to people whose income is 100 percent to 400 percent of the federal poverty level .Those with lower incomes , including many people with HIV-AIDS , were supposed to be covered by Medicaid , the joint federal-state health insurance program for the poor , but Louisiana did not expand the program as the ACA intended so as to make them eligible .Louisiana Blue has cited the need to prevent `` potential fraud , waste and abuse '' as its reason for refusing third-party payments , including those from the government .Healthcare advocates are concerned , however , that the policy is instead an effort to minimize the number of people with HIV-AIDS the company insures .Louisiana Blue `` has the best drug plans for HIV , '' said Moriba Karamoko , director of the Louisiana Consumer Healthcare Coalition , who has been trying to help resolve the impasse . `` They 're the only ones that cover the single-tablet regimen '' prescribed to control HIV ; other plans cover multi-pill HIV treatment , which patients find onerous .`` They 're worried that they 'll end up with everybody '' with HIV-AIDS , said Karamoko .The Lambda Legal complaint , filed with the Office of Civil Rights at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services , CMS 's parent agency , asks the government to investigate the insurer and could lead to a faster resolution than a lawsuit , explained Lambda director of constitutional litigation Susan Sommer .Louisiana Blue 's decision to reject Ryan White payments for the premiums of people with HIV-AIDS `` seems to be an effort to discriminate against people with HIV , '' she said . `` Every day ( the company ) keeps this policy is a day it deters people with HIV from signing up for one of its plans . ''The company said it is aware of the complaint but would not comment further .( This story was refiled to fix typo in headline )( Reporting by Sharon Begley in New York ; Editing by Alden Bentley )"

The company said it reaches 245,000 healthcare providers , representing more than half of the insured population in the United States .Englewood , Colorado-based TriZetto is the latest U.S. healthcare IT services provider to be acquired as payers and providers of healthcare seek new ways to cut costs .`` Healthcare is undergoing structural shifts due to reform , cost pressure and shifting responsibilities between payers and providers , '' Cognizant CEO Francisco D'Souza said in a statement .`` This creates a significant growth opportunity , which TriZetto will help us capture . ''The company in August forecast its slowest full-year sales growth in its 20-year history .Cognizant , whose rivals include Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and Infosys Ltd , said it expected revenue synergies of $ 1.5 billion over the next five years from the deal .The company said the deal would immediately add to adjusted profit on closing , expected in the quarter ending December .Apax Partners , which acquired TriZetto in 2008 , was exploring a sale of the company , sources told Reuters in August .TriZetto had 12-month earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortization of more than $ 190 million as of June 30 , one of the sources had then said .Cognizant said on Monday it would fund the deal through a combination of cash and debt and had secured $ 1 billion in financing .The deal comes after private equity firms Silver Lake Partners LP and BC Partners Ltd sold health insurance claims processor MultiPlan Inc for $ 4.4 billion in March to a consortium led by Maurice `` Hank '' Greenberg 's buyout firm Starr Investment Holdings LLC .Credit Suisse , UBS Securities LLC and Centerview Partners advised Cognizant , while J.P.Morgan Securities LLC and Goldman Sachs & Co advised TriZetto .Cognizant 's shares closed at $ 44.76 on the Nasdaq on Friday .( Reporting by Soham Chatterjee in Bangalore ; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty and Sriraj Kalluvila )"
1	"( Reuters ) - Consumers who purchased new health plans from Blue Shield of California have sued the insurer , claiming they were misled into thinking the insurance would cover their desired doctors and hospitals .In their complaint filed in California state court on Wednesday , San Francisco residents John Harrington and Alex Talon accused Blue Shield of misrepresenting that their plans , sold on California 's health exchange , would cover the full provider network advertised on the company 's website .They sued on behalf of a class of people who had purchased so-called `` preferred provider organization '' plans from the insurer only to realize that the doctor and hospital networks for their plans were limited .Blue Shield of California spokesman Sean Barry said in an emailed statement that the company was reviewing the complaint .`` We take these charges seriously , and believe enrollees should be as informed as possible about the products they select , '' he said .The 2010 Affordable Care Act , often called Obamacare , created online insurance exchanges where individuals can buy health coverage with income-based government subsidies . The law requires individuals to buy a minimum level of coverage or pay a penalty .As insurance companies have tried to make their plans offered on health exchanges more affordable , they have adopted a strategy of limiting their networks of medical providers . These networks have come under scrutiny as individuals have begun to realize their new plans may exclude their preferred doctor or hospital .Both Harrington and Talon , who were previously uninsured , purchased health plans from Blue Shield of California to comply with the new insurance requirement , known as the individual mandate , the complaint said .Harrington bought a so-called silver plan on California 's online exchange while Talon bought a platinum plan through the insurer 's website . They said they made their choices based on Blue Shield 's alleged representations that their doctors would be covered .The lawsuit accuses Blue Shield of advertising `` one of the largest networks in the state '' - with more than 60,000 physicians and 351 hospitals - and of failing to disclose that the networks for certain plans were substantially smaller .After receiving medical treatment numerous times between January and March , Harrington and Talon later discovered that their providers were not covered , forcing them to pay the charges out-of-pocket , the complaint said .The lawsuit alleged claims of false advertising , unfair business practices and breach of contract under California law .The case is Harrington et al v.

1	"( Reuters ) - Democratic Governor Terry McAuliffe proposed a plan on Monday to provide medical insurance for 25,000 uninsured Virginians , a move that falls short of his vow to expand coverage to 400,000 people despite Republican objections .McAuliffe said in June after losing a fight with the Republican-controlled legislature over Medicaid , the federal-state healthcare program for the poor , that he would close the gap without lawmakers ' help .The 25,000 Virginians who would get insurance group about 20,000 people who are mentally ill and 5,000 children of state employees , the governor said in a statement .The insurance expansion is part of a 10-point healthcare program that would affect more than 200,000 people , mostly by improving care for those already in Medicaid and boosting efforts to sign up Virginians who qualify for it but are not enrolled .McAuliffe , who took office in January , said he would use $ 40 million in leftover state health care funds to provide coverage for the mentally ill .Virginia also can include children of state employees because the 2010 Affordable Care Act , known as Obamacare , lifted a ban against enrolling them in the federal program , he said .McAuliffe , a former head of the Democratic National Committee , campaigned in 2013 on increasing Medicaid coverage , a measure that he said would create 30,000 jobs in Virginia .McAuliffe had linked the state 's budget to Medicaid expansion . Republican state lawmakers inserted last-minute language into Virginia 's two-year budget in June to block McAuliffe 's proposed expansion to cover 400,000 uninsured Virginians .McAuliffe had contended that accepting $ 2 billion in federal funds to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act would create jobs , raise state salaries and bolster pensions .Republican lawmakers opted not to accept the funds .( Reporting by Ian Simpson ; Editing by Doina Chiacu )"
1	"( Reuters ) - Federal officials have reached an agreement with Pennsylvania Gov . Tom Corbett over his plan to use federal funds to pay for private health insurance coverage for up to 600,000 residents , the governor said on Thursday .The deal highlights a growing number of Republican governors who are finding ways to accept money under President Barack Obama 's Affordable Care Act , despite political opposition that has so far prevented nearly half of U.S. states from moving forward with the Medicaid expansion plan .Corbett sought a waiver in February to use those expansion funds to instead subsidize private health insurance for low-income residents .Medicaid expansion under Obamacare has become a tool for political jockeying , with many Republicans loathe to support it . In Pennsylvania , the dispute is partly semantic .Corbett , who is lagging in the polls in his bid for re-election this fall , said his plan , Healthy Pennsylvania , is not expansion under so-called Obamacare .The governor `` has been clear that he would not expand Medicaid because it is an unsustainable entitlement program , '' a statement from his office said on Thursday .However , federal officials said the approval made Pennsylvania the 27th state to expand Medicaid under Obamacare .Federal health officials are `` committed to supporting state flexibility and working with states on innovative solutions that work within the confines of the law to expand Medicaid to low-income individuals , '' said Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Administrator Marilyn Tavenner in a statement .Republican governors in Ohio , Michigan and Iowa have already extended health coverage to poor constituents with Medicaid funding under Obamacare . Indiana and Utah are actively negotiating for new plans with the administration .`` The politics in these states are tough . You ca n't simply do the Medicaid expansion as is and expect public support , '' said Benjamin Sommers , a Medicaid expert at the Harvard School of Public Health .Health reform advocates predicted that further expansions in Republican-led states will follow Pennsylvania 's lead by playing down the role of Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act in their programs .Federal officials did not approve a controversial Pennsylvania provision that would have required active job searches in order for the unemployed to receive coverage . But a voluntary job training program that reduces premium costs for participants was allowed .The approved program will also reduce 14 current Medicaid plans to two benefit packages , one for low-risk residents and another for high risk .Enrollment begins Dec. 1 , with coverage to go into effect Jan. 1 . Those earning 133 percent of the federal poverty level qualify , though the effective level is 138 percent , or $ 32,913 for a family of four .About 6.4 million Americans who live below the poverty line are expected to remain uninsured in the 23 states that have not expanded Medicaid .( Reporting by Hilary Russ in New York and David Morgan in Washington ; Editing by Diane Craft )"
1	"( Reuters ) - Health insurance premiums for low-cost Obamacare plans in 16 U.S. cities will fall slightly in 2015 as competition helps drives down price for the new subsidized individual health plans , according to a study Friday from the Kaiser Family Foundation .The Kaiser analysis found that the premiums for the second lowest cost `` silver '' tier plan , upon which government tax credit subsidies are based , will fall compared with 2014 prices by an average of 0.8 percent in 7 of 16 major cities .If the trend holds across the country , the study said , the lower benchmark premium could mean that the government subsidies are less overall and there are more tax savings .Private insurers began selling new health insurance plans for individuals last year for coverage starting in 2014 . Plans for 2015 insurance coverage will be up for sale starting on Nov. 15 , 2014 when enrollment opens .Kaiser found that among the biggest changes in pricing were a decline on average of more than 15 percent in Denver to $ 211 , of 11 percent in Providence , Rhode Island to $ 260 and of nearly 10 percent in Seattle to $ 254 .In Nashville , Tennessee , the silver premium price will rise 8.7 percent to $ 205 , while Burlington , Vermont will have a 6.6 percent rise to $ 440 and Portland , Oregon will go up 6 percent to $ 213 , the study said . The premiums exclude income-based government subsidies .Including these tax credits , the average in the 16 cities would be a monthly premium of $ 208 versus $ 209 a year earlier , the study found .Premiums for the lowest tier plan , bronze , are increasing an average of 3.3 percent in 2015 , the study found .Kaiser looked at plan premiums before and after federal tax credits for a 40-year old single adult who is a non-smoker and earns $ 30,000 per year .( Reporting by Caroline Humer ; Editing by Grant McCool )"

1	"( Reuters ) - Healthcare premiums will rise an average of 4.2 percent in 2015 on California 's health insurance exchange , the largest of the state marketplaces established by President Barack Obama 's healthcare reform , state officials said on Thursday .Ten companies will sell plans for 2015 through Covered California , three fewer than this year , said the exchange 's Executive Director Peter Lee .Opponents of Obama 's healthcare reform , the 2010 Affordable Care Act , have warned for months that 2015 premiums would soar due to the high medical costs of the first wave of enrollees who , they claimed , are older and sicker than the general population .In California , however , insurers ' projections of 2014 medical spending were fairly accurate . One of the largest insurers , WellPoint Inc , said this week that because its 2014 premiums matched medical costs it had generally proposed smaller increases than competitors .Other companies planning to sell 2015 Obamacare policies in California include Kaiser Permanente , Health Net , and Molina Healthcare .California is the largest of about a dozen states to announce proposed 2015 rates . Each state 's insurance department or other agency must approved premiums .Most increases are in the mid-single digits , Andy Slavitt , principal deputy commissioner of lead Obamacare agency the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , told Congress on Thursday .An analysis by the non-profit research and advocacy group FamiliesUSA found that proposed 2015 premiums varied widely from state to state and even within states . One Colorado plan has a 22 percent decrease while another has a 17.5 percent increase , for instance . In Indiana proposed rates vary from a 3 percent drop to a 35 percent rise .Overall , proposed premiums fell for at least one plan in nine of the 12 states , FamiliesUSA said .If the California premiums are approved , 16 percent of customers would see the same or lower premiums for their current plan , one-third would see an increase of up to 5 percent , one-third would pay 5 to 8 percent more , and 13 percent would pay 8 percent more . Consumers should shop around rather than automatically renew , said Lee of Covered California .One way insurers have kept a rein on spending was through `` narrow networks , '' covering healthcare received at a limited number of doctors and hospitals . That has triggered lawsuits against Anthem Blue Cross , a division of WellPoint and the largest Obamacare carrier in California , by customers claiming they were misled about where they could obtain care .Also , the state did not let people keep plans that did not comply with Obamacare standards . That brought an influx of healthy people that left California `` well positioned for modest premium increases , '' said healthcare policy expert Larry Levitt of the Kaiser Family Foundation .Insurers not returning in 2015 specialize in Medicaid plans and could not meet new requirements , Lee said .In the first open-enrollment period , 1.4 million people bought policies on Covered California , and 8 million nationally .

1	"( Reuters ) - Hospitals and medical practices across the United States braced for confusion and administrative hassles as new insurance plans under President Barack Obama 's healthcare law took effect on Wednesday .More than 2 million people enrolled in private plans offered under the Affordable Care Act , popularly known as Obamacare , during the initial sign-up period for health benefits . Enrollment began in October and lasts through March , but Americans in most states had to enroll by last week to get coverage that takes effect with the start of the new year .A spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , or CMS , part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services , said there were no hiccups to report in the first day the plans were in effect .The expansion of coverage through the new plans is one of the main parts of the 2010 law , the most sweeping U.S. social legislation in 50 years . Over time , the law - which requires most Americans to buy insurance , offers subsidies to help low-income people get covered and sets minimum standards for coverage - aims to dramatically reduce the number of Americans who lack health insurance , which the U.S. government has estimated at more than 45 million .After a difficult October launch plagued by problems with the website used to enroll people in coverage , the focus for the government and healthcare providers has turned to what will happen beginning on Wednesday when patients with the new coverage start to seek care .The law still faces political and legal hurdles . Roman Catholic Church-affiliated organizations obtained last-minute court injunctions on Tuesday that gave them temporary exemptions from a part of the healthcare law that requires employers to provide insurance policies covering contraception .U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor granted one temporary injunction to Baltimore-based Little Sisters of the Poor and Illinois-based Christian Brothers Services , plus related entities .The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services had 10,000 agents on call for New Year 's Eve and New Year 's Day to field questions from people dealing with enrollment problems .`` We are ready ourselves to assist consumers as well with our full complement of call center representatives available , '' said Julie Bataille , spokeswoman for the CMS .At the start , confirming a patient 's plan may present headaches for care providers . The Obama administration has acknowledged that errors occurred in transmitting enrollment data to insurers , especially early in the enrollment period . An official said it was `` reaching out '' to providers who have expressed concerns about implementation , and was also trying to help anticipate problems .`` It will be difficult for us to actually verify coverage - that 's my concern , '' said Dr. William Wulf , chief executive of Central Ohio Primary Care , which has 250 primary-care physicians .The task could be made more difficult by decisions by the U.S. government and many states to push back enrollment deadlines toward the end of the year . The late deadlines mean that many enrollees who seek care initially may lack insurance cards or other proof of coverage .Wulf said his physician offices will assume existing patients are covered if they say they are when they come in for appointments and their coverage can not be verified immediately . But if they require expensive tests , such as MRIs or heart-stress tests that can cost up to $ 700 , the practice will check with insurers first to make sure the patient has coverage .Dr. Andy Chiou , chief executive of Peoria Surgical Group Ltd in Illinois , said that if the practice finds a `` significant minority '' of its patients do not have coverage when they believe they do , it might delay elective surgeries for patients until their insurance is confirmed .`` For the protection of patients and us , we 'll have to say , 'Sorry , you do n't have insurance , ' '' Chiou said .POLITICAL STAKES HIGHFor the Obama administration , the political stakes are high in ensuring a smooth transition period for coverage , particularly after the website 's problems damaged the popularity of the Democratic president and the healthcare overhaul , his signature domestic achievement .The White House trumpeted New Year 's Day as the start of healthcare coverage for millions of Americans .`` The challenges in our healthcare system were decades in the making and wo n't be solved overnight , but now more than 6 million Americans have been enrolled in marketplace or Medicaid coverage and are getting peace of mind , '' wrote White House health policy adviser Phil Schiliro in a blog post .Republicans , who control the House of Representatives , have called Obamacare a costly program that will rob many Americans of insurance choices and have said they will make Obamacare 's problems their top issue in the November 2014 elections , when control of Congress will be at stake .Late Wednesday , though , Democrats in the House seized on the first day of the expansion as a political victory and pushed Republicans to give up on defanging the law .`` When Congress reconvenes next week , it is my hope that Republicans will work with Democrats to implement this law rather than continuing their focus on repealing its important patient protections and cost-saving reforms , '' said Steny Hoyer , who is the second most powerful Democrat in the House as Minority Whip , in a statement .Still , Republicans were bolstered by Sotomayor 's injunction , with Senator Roy Blunt , vice chairman of the Senate Republican Conference , saying the insurance mandate is `` an egregious and blatant violation '' of religious freedom .The U.S. government has tried to anticipate the coverage problems new enrollees might encounter . The federally run Healthcare.Gov website posted advice last week on what enrollees should do if they have not received an insurance card , encounter problems getting coverage for a drug prescription , or need to appeal a decision by an insurer .`` For consumers whose marketplace coverage begins on January 1 , we 're doing everything we can to help ensure a smooth transition period , '' Kathleen Sebelius , the U.S. secretary of health and human services , said in blog posting on Tuesday .`` What we are stressing to folks is that if they get to a provider ( and ) there is some confusion ( about coverage ) , call their insurer , '' Schiliro said . `` If the insurer is not able to resolve it , they should call our toll-free number ( 800-318-2596 ) ... and operators will be there 24/7 . ''Some healthcare companies are trying to get ahead of potential problems as well .The pharmacy chain Walgreen Co said on Monday it would allow consumers who had not yet received plan identification numbers from their insurers to get prescriptions at no upfront cost in January , if they could provide evidence of their coverage or pharmacy staff could otherwise confirm it .Wal-Mart said on Tuesday it would institute a similar practice .HOSPITALS READY FOR CHANGEHospital executives said they were ready for potential hiccups with the newly insured .The vast majority of Americans have employer-based coverage and Medicare plans and can choose new plans every January , so executives said the beginning of the Obamacare plans represented a more intense version of an insurance transition period they were already familiar with .`` Hospitals feel like they 're pretty well prepared because they 've had systems in place and tools in place to work through these sorts of issues , '' said Jeff Goldman , vice president of coverage policy for the American Hospital Association . `` We expect an uptick in volume , but we do n't think it 's anything beyond what most hospitals are prepared to handle . ''As many as 7 million people were expected to sign up for coverage in the Obamacare plans for 2014 , but enrollment is so far well short of that figure , largely because of the problems with the HealthCare.gov website . Residents of 36 states use the site to enroll . Those in the other 14 states use state-run websites . Hospitals , therefore , may have been preparing for more new enrollees than they are likely to see at this point .At New York 's Montefiore Medical Center , staffers were trained on how the new healthcare plans work , partly so they could help patients resolve any coverage issues , said Lynn Richmond , the medical center 's chief of staff .`` There 's not a lot of active worry on our part , '' Richmond said . `` We feel ready to manage the hiccups . ''Indeed , many have eagerly anticipated the law 's broadening of coverage .

1	"( Reuters ) - IT services provider Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp forecast current-quarter revenue above analysts ' estimates due to higher spending by financial services and healthcare clients .Shares of the company , which also reported higher-than-expected revenue for the third quarter , rose as much as 7.8 percent on Wednesday .Chief Financial Officer Karen McLoughlin told Reuters that spending by clients in pharmaceutical and life sciences industries was recovering after several quarters of slow growth .The company 's healthcare clients include insurers , hospitals and some state-run exchanges set up under the U.S . Affordable Care Act , also known as Obamacare .Growth in the business , which accounts for about 25 percent of total revenue , slowed significantly to 9.2 percent in the third quarter from 24 percent a year earlier and 19 percent in the second quarter .The year-earlier quarter reflected high demand for the company 's services from U.S. healthcare exchanges to handle initial enrollments for Obamacare .Cognizant said in September that it was acquiring healthcare IT services provider TriZetto Corp for $ 2.7 billion , its biggest deal ever , to boost its healthcare business .Cognizant forecast on Wednesday revenue of $ 2.61 billion- $ 2.64 billion for the fourth quarter .Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $ 2.58 billion , according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S .`` The overall demand environment remains strong , '' Cognizant President Gordon Coburn said on a conference call .The company 's net income rose to $ 355.6 million , or 58 cents per share , in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 from $ 319.6 million , or 53 cents per share , a year earlier , due to higher spending by North American and European clients .North America accounts for about three-quarters of the company 's total revenue , while Europe makes up for about 18 percent .Total revenue rose about 12 percent to $ 2.58 billion , above the average analyst estimate of $ 2.57 billion .Rival Tata Consultancy Services Ltd reported a lower-than expected quarterly profit last month , while Infosys Ltd 's quarterly profit beat the average analyst estimate .Cognizant 's shares were up 7.8 percent at $ 52.28 in afternoon trading on the Nasdaq .( Additional reporting by Lehar Maan in Bangalore ; Editing by Kirti Pandey )"
1	"( Reuters ) - In his essay coming out as gay , Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook criticized an Arizona proposal that would have given private business owners the ability to deny services to gay people on religious grounds .Cook on Thursday became the most prominent American corporate leader to come out , saying he was trading his closely guarded privacy for the chance to help move civil rights forward .His discussion of the Arizona proposal and other laws allowing gay employees to be fired highlights a new stage in the gay rights debate , after conservative challenges to same sex marriage were beaten down in several appeals courts .Now courts across the country are trying to balance the civil rights of gay people and some religious business owners . A Washington state florist , bakers in Colorado and Oregon , and a bed-and-breakfast owner in Hawaii all are refusing to provide services to gay couples , citing religious beliefs .In Massachusetts , a gay food service manager sued a religious school after it pulled a job offer upon learning of his husband .The U.S. Supreme Court has issued a string of rulings friendly to gay marriage over the past two years . Most recently , the high court effectively legalized same sex nuptials in several states when it refused to overturn lower court rulings .However , the high court has also been assertive in protecting religious freedom . In an opinion earlier this year , the court allowed a business owner to avoid an Obamacare requirement for employee birth control , citing the owner 's religious beliefs .That case , Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores , has now surfaced in a dispute between two gay California women and a Hawaii bed and breakfast owner who refused to rent a room to them . A Hawaii judge ruled the business owner violated an antidiscrimination law , and she appealed .`` Because of her sincerely held religious beliefs , she does not allow unmarried opposite-sex couples or same-sex couples to rent a room with a single bed together , '' her lawyers said in a court filing . They later cited the Hobby Lobby decision , saying it limits the government 's ability to compel religious objectors to change their business practices .Lawyers for the business owner did not immediately respond to a call for comment .The California couple 's lawyers argued Hobby Lobby provides no shield for discrimination even if cloaked as religious practice . The case is still pending at a Hawaii appeals court .Jennifer Pizer , Law and Policy Project Director for gay rights group Lambda Legal , said the Supreme Court could be even more deferential to religious groups in future cases .`` That affects the overall landscape in a very profound way , and often not in a good way for gay people , '' she said .The Arizona proposal was passed by the state legislature and vetoed by the governor earlier this year .

1	"( Reuters ) - Individuals who purchased health insurance set up under U.S. President Barack Obama 's healthcare reform law rate their personal health as worse than people who bought individual plans elsewhere , a Kaiser Family Foundation survey found .The survey , conducted after enrollment in Obamacare plans closed in April and released on Thursday , is the first comprehensive study addressing the health of those who have purchased this new insurance , created by the Affordable Care Act .About 8 million people purchased Obamacare plans , more than half of them qualifying for government subsidies toward their monthly premiums based on household income .The relative health of policyholders is a key factor for insurers when they set premium rates , which are designed to cover the costs of medical services among participants . Kaiser said it was unclear how this finding might influence rates because insurers had been anticipating a sicker-than-average customer base .The telephone survey of a nationally representative sample of 742 people also found that 57 percent of the new Obamacare plan members had been uninsured just before they obtained coverage . Most of them said they had not had coverage for at least two years .Insurers including WellPoint Inc and Aetna Inc have said they are still gathering data about their new customers , many of whose coverage did not start until May 1 . Insurers have already submitted many of their 2015 rates to regulators .The survey found that 16 percent of respondents with Obamacare plans purchased on state exchanges rated their health as `` fair , '' the fourth-worst of five levels offered . That compared with an average of 11 percent for all people who bought individual insurance .About 4 percent of people buying from the Obamacare exchanges rated their health as `` poor , '' compared with 2 percent in individual plans sold outside of those exchange and less than 0.5 percent of people who still hold plans that do not comply with the law . These plans are expected to phase out of the market in the next three years .At the opposite end , 21 percent of people in Obamacare exchange plans said they had `` excellent '' health , compared with 24 percent of all individual plan holders .Twenty-seven percent of Obamacare plan members said they had `` very good '' health , compared with 31 percent overall , and 31 percent said they had `` good '' health , compared with 30 percent overall .Kaiser found the 55-to-64 age group was the largest among members of ACA-compliant plans sold both on and off the exchanges . People older than 65 are eligible for the government 's Medicare program .Of the other holders of ACA-compliant plans , 17 percent were aged 18 to 25 , and another 17 percent were 26 to 34 . About 19 percent were 35 to 44 , and 21 percent were in the 45-to-54 age bracket .The survey was conducted April 3 to May 11 ."
1	"( Reuters ) - One of the most highly contentious Obamacare programs , which calls on states to expand their publicly-funded healthcare for the poor , could see a second wave of participation by U.S. states later this year or early in 2015 , according to state officials and independent analysts .Following are states whose governor 's offices or legislators have held talks with President Barack Obama 's administration about possible options for extending healthcare coverage known as Medicaid to uninsured low-income residents .Also included are the financial costs and benefits they could see over the coming decade by opting for expansion .The Obama administration says it will cover 100 percent of the cost of expansion through 2016 , and never less than 90 percent thereafter , a prospect that would mean billions of dollars in new federal funding for even sparsely populated states . But Republicans worry that the federal government 's commitment could weaken over time , leaving states to foot some substantial Medicaid bills .The Medicaid expansion is part of a broader reform under the law called Affordable Care Act , or Obamacare , which aims to reduce healthcare costs , now the highest in the world , make health insurance more affordable and limit the number of uninsured Americans .Medicaid was created in the 1960s along with the federal program Medicare , which provides health coverage for the elderly . Most Medicaid coverage , jointly financed by federal and state money , has gone to narrowly defined groups including children , pregnant women and the severely disabled  a fact that has left millions of poor adults without healthcare until now .The following data comes from a report by the nonpartisan Urban Institute .

1	"( Reuters ) - Republicans in Congress sought to showcase what they call major security problems with the Obamacare website HealthCare.gov on Thursday , just as U.S. officials ramp up a national campaign to persuade young adults to use the site to enroll in health insurance .In a public messaging tug-of-war that will likely intensify in coming weeks , the Republican-led House of Representatives targeted the healthcare reform law in three separate oversight hearings . Two were geared toward Republican claims that HealthCare.gov remains vulnerable to hackers more than three months after its botched October 1 rollout .Democrats accused Republicans of `` cherry picking '' partial information about the website to try and scare consumers away from it . Later in the day , Obamacare supporters , including federal and state officials , staged a six-hour presentation on YouTube.com intended to drive enrollment among 18-to-34-year-olds .The administration also disclosed plans for a media promotion campaign during next month 's Winter Olympics in Sochi , Russia , and unveiled 30-second ads with former basketball stars Magic Johnson and Alonzo Mourning .U.S. officials are eager to boost youth participation , which is widely seen as vital to the success of President Barack Obama 's signature domestic policy achievement .The administration needs enough young people , who are typically healthier , so that their premiums will help offset costs from older enrollees and prevent insurers from raising their rates .Officials hope to enroll more than 2.5 million young Americans in coverage by a March 31 deadline . So far they have signed up only about one-fifth of that number , partly due to early technical glitches at HealthCare.gov .While the performance of the website has greatly improved , the Obama administration is contending with fresh attacks from Republicans eager to highlight the healthcare reform 's flaws , including security questions .`` It seems to defy common sense that a website plagued with functional problems was , in fact , perfectly secure by design , '' said Darrell Issa , chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , who presided over one of Thursday 's security hearings .At another Republican-led hearing , a cybersecurity professional warned that the federal government has failed to implement fixes necessary to protect the HealthCare.gov website from hackers .`` HealthCare.gov is not secure today , '' David Kennedy , head of computer security consulting firm TrustedSec LLC , told the House Science , Space and Technology Committee .HealthCare.gov is the consumer web portal to a 36-state federal health insurance marketplace , which offers private insurance , with federally subsidized rates for some consumers . The 14 other states have built their own marketplaces .Kennedy said `` nothing has really changed '' since a hearing before the same committee in November when he and three other expert witnesses said they believed the site was not secure and three of them said it should be shut down immediately .`` I do n't understand how we 're still discussing whether the website is insecure or not , '' said Kennedy , who worked for the National Security Agency and the U.S. Marine Corps before entering the private sector . `` It is insecure - 100 percent . ''Before the hearing , Kennedy told Reuters the government has yet to plug more than 20 vulnerabilities that he and other security experts reported to the government shortly after HealthCare.gov went live on October 1 . Hackers could steal personal information , modify data , attack the personal computers of website users and damage the infrastructure of the site , Kennedy said in an interview .The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) , the federal agency responsible for HealthCare.gov , said in a statement to Reuters , `` There have been no successful security attacks on Healthcare.gov and no person or group has maliciously accessed personally identifiable information from the site . ''CMS said Kennedy 's methodology undermined his findings : `` Because this individual had no direct access to the operations of the HealthCare.gov website , the information in the report is based on assumptions , not fact . ''The agency 's information security chief also publicly tried to reassure lawmakers that the site is safe .The CMS chief information security officer , Teresa Fryer , said the website underwent end-to-end security testing on December 18 and met all industry standards .`` The ( federal marketplace ) is secure . In many instances , we have gone above and beyond what is required , with layered protection , continuous monitoring and additional penetration testing , '' Fryer said before the House Oversight panel .Democratic Representative Elijah Cummings charged that Republicans were `` cherry-picking partial information to promote a narrative that is inaccurate '' about the Obamacare website , when its security was `` strong and keeps getting stronger '' .Instead of holding ever more hearings on the Obamacare website , lawmakers should be looking into the massive data breach affecting millions at Target Corp , Cummings said at the hearing where CMS 's Fryer appeared .As the hearings took place , Republicans sought to amplify their anti-Obamacare message by advancing another bill to tweak the law . The legislation , which passed by a 259-154 vote , would require the Obama administration to issue weekly enrollment statistics .The White House considers the transparency bill another Republican attempt to harass implementation of its healthcare reform . However , 33 Democrats voted for the bill . Last week , the House passed a Republican measure that would require the government to notify consumers in two days if their personal information on HealthCare.gov has been compromised .( Additional reporting by Susan Cornwell , Doina Chiacu and Bill Trott in Washington ; Editing by Karey Van Hall and Leslie Adler )"
1	"( Reuters ) - The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) , in an effort to keep insurers from denying coverage to people with HIV/AIDS , may strengthen its position on health plans accepting third-party payments , such as those under the 1990 Ryan White Act .Hundreds of people with HIV/AIDS in Louisiana trying to obtain coverage under President Barack Obama 's healthcare reform are in danger of being thrown out of the insurance plan they selected in a dispute over federal subsidies and interpretation of rules about preventing Obamacare fraud , Reuters reported on Saturday .Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana , the state 's largest health insurer , is rejecting checks from a federal program designed to help these patients pay for AIDS drugs and insurance premiums , and has begun notifying customers that their enrollment in its Obamacare plans will be discontinued .The insurer insists it is not trying to keep people with HIV/AIDS from enrolling in one of its policies under the Affordable Care Act , but is instead rejecting third party premium payments in an effort to prevent potential fraud .`` Federal rules do not prevent the use of Ryan White funds to pay for health care plans , '' CMS said in a statement late on Saturday , adding that it had issued guidance `` encouraging issuers and Marketplaces to accept such payments . ''CMS suggested that such encouragement may not be enough to protect patients in need of expensive life-saving medicines .`` Given the importance of access to care for people with HIV/AIDS , CMS is considering amending those rules to require issuers to accept these payments , '' the lead Obamacare agency said .The 1990 Ryan White Act offered people with HIV/AIDS federal financial help in paying for AIDS drugs and health insurance premiums , especially in state-run , high-risk pools . Obamacare , which bans insurers from discriminating against people with preexisting conditions , was designed to replace these high-risk pools .Hundreds of HIV/AIDS patients are dependent on Ryan White payments for Obamacare because they fall into a coverage gap . They are not eligible for Medicaid , the joint federal-state health insurance program for the poor , because Louisiana did not expand the low-income program , and Obamacare federal subsidies do n't kick in until people are at 100 percent of the federal poverty level .( Reporting by Bill Berkrot and Sharon Begley ; Editing by Bernard Orr )"
1	"( Reuters ) - The U.S. Supreme Court has been asked to review a case about whether the federal government can subsidize health insurance for millions of Americans , a party involved in the lawsuit said on Thursday .The petition requests the U.S. high court decide the issue after two lower U.S. court rulings created uncertainties last week regarding the legitimacy of subsidies for individuals enrolled on federally run exchanges under the Affordable Care Act , or Obamacare .The Competitive Enterprise Institute , which is coordinating and funding the cases , filed the petition , according to the not-for-profit 's website . ( http : //bit.ly/1tA8r5x )The twin appeals court rulings , handed down by three-judge panels in Washington , D.C. , and Richmond , Virginia , fell in line with partisan disagreements over healthcare reform . Two judges appointed by Republican presidents decided against the administration in the District of Columbia and three judges appointed by Democrats ruled in favor in Virginia .The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled in a 2-1 decision that the language in the Affordable Care Act dealing with subsidies shows they should only be provided to consumers who purchase benefits on exchanges run by individual states .However , plaintiffs in the D.C . Circuit case , known as Halbig v. Burwell , claimed that Congress did not intend to provide subsidies through federally operated marketplaces .While the Supreme Court has broad discretion over which cases to take , a split among lower courts can be a big factor in its deciding whether to hear an appeal .The Supreme Court upheld the Obamacare law on constitutional grounds in 2012 but allowed states to opt out of a major provision involving Medicaid coverage .Analysts estimate that as many as 5 million people could be affected if subsidies disappear from the federal marketplace , which serves 36 states through the website HealthCare.gov .( Reporting by Narottam Medhora and Amrutha Penumudi in Bangalore ; Editing by Lisa Shumaker )"
1	"( Reuters ) - The number of insurers offering individual health plans on the Obamacare exchanges will increase about 25 percent in 2015 and that should keep down prices , the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said on Tuesday in a report .More than 7 million people signed up for health insurance through the exchanges in 2014 , which were created under President Barack Obama 's national healthcare reform law and offer income-based subsidies .Next year , there will be 63 additional issuers in the 44 states for which it has data , the agency said in a report . Some insurers left the market , it said .Healthcare.gov , which sells insurance in 36 states , will have 248 issuers in 2015 , an increase of 30 percent from 2014 , it said .`` We 're seeing it as evidence that these are attractive marketplaces , and just from our casual review of investor communications by the firms , these are being seen as growth opportunities , '' an HHS official said .The nation 's largest health insurer UnitedHealth Group Inc , which offered only a few plans in 2014 , submitted plans in more than two dozen states . Other large insurers have said they have either maintained or increased their presence on the exchanges for 2015 . Aetna Inc , Humana Incand WellPoint Inc all offer more than a dozen plans .Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell cited the increase in the number of insurers selling plans and a study showing that 7 in 10 Americans find the coverage affordable . `` There 's no surprise ... that when folks evaluate the success of the law , the marketplace receives much of the attention , '' she said in prepared remarks for a speech at Brookings .The report said past data has shown that for each additional insurer , the monthly premium price in that market declines for the benchmark plan by 4 percent .Based on the data collected for the 44 states , only California is expected to have a decline in the number of insurers offering plans to 10 from 12 . New Hampshire and West Virginia , which both had only 1 insurer offering plans in 2014 , will increase to 5 insurers and 2 insurers respectively . Each insurer is counted as one issuer in each state where it sells plans .There are six states running their own online marketplaces whose information was not included in the report .

1	"( Reuters ) - U.S. consumers eligible for Obamacare health plans could see double-digit price hikes next year in states that fail to draw large numbers of enrollees for 2014 , including some states that have been hostile to the healthcare law , according to insurance industry officials and analysts .The early estimates come as insurance companies set out to design plans they intend to sell in 2015 through the state-based health insurance marketplaces that are a centerpiece of the Affordable Care Act , President Barack Obama 's signature domestic policy achievement that is widely referred to as Obamacare .WellPoint Inc , which sells plans on 14 Obamacare exchanges , expects health insurance rates nationwide to be higher . Increases for the Obamacare market that has signed up about 5 million people to date is expected to outpace those in the employer-sponsored market , which serves about 170 million people .`` Looking at the rate increases on a year-over-year basis on our exchanges , and it will vary by carrier , but all of them will probably be in double digit plus , '' Ken Goulet , president of WellPoint 's commercial business , told investors in New York on Friday .The cost of health insurance is already a political hot potato in this year 's election campaign for control of Congress , with Republicans warning of the potential for sky-rocketing rates in their attempt to turn the ballot into a referendum on Obamacare .Insurers have noted the difficulty of building and pricing plans for 2015 , which will mark the second year of the Obamacare exchanges . Enrollment for 2014 closes on March 31 , giving them very little time to review the costs of covering their new members before submitting proposed rates to insurance regulators in May and June .Industry officials and independent analysts say the lack of hard data will mean huge variations in premiums , with increases ranging from the high single-digit percentages in some states to as much as 30 percent in others .Slow enrollment is a potential harbinger of big price hikes in over a dozen states , where technology failures or political opposition to Obamacare may have deterred younger and healthier residents from signing up .Because the healthcare law prevents insurers from charging sick people higher premiums , the participation of healthy young people is needed to offset the cost of covering policyholders with preexisting conditions . Government data so far has shown about 25 percent of new Obamacare enrollees are in the younger demographic of adults aged 18 to 34 , well below the White House 's 38 percent target before last October 's botched rollout .Government actuaries predict an 8 percent increase in overall net insurance costs next year . Last week , U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told a congressional committee : `` I think premiums are likely to go up , but go up at a slower pace than what we 've seen since 2010 . ''Some analysts say the more dire industry expectations reflect companies ' uncertainty rather than the true costs of the market .`` I think it 'll be the exception . But there will be some sections of the country with significantly higher insurance premiums , '' said Larry Levitt , a policy expert at the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation , which tracks healthcare trends .Levitt predicts that most states will see premium increases of 7 percent to 10 percent in 2015 , as insurers compensate for factors including the rising cost of medical services and reduced funding for a temporary federal program that compensates insurers for high claim costs .COMPETITIVE PRESSURELevitt and other analysts said competition between plans should also brake upward price momentum in most states , while some consumers should also benefit from aggressive state insurance regulators unwilling to allow big cost hikes .Even after the end of open enrollment , a steady stream of new customers is expected to transition into the Obamacare marketplaces throughout 2014 , due to life changes that allow for special enrollments , including job loss , marriage and parenthood . As a result , insurers could find themselves under constant pressure to keep prices competitive .`` There 's going to be this continuing need to market and get new enrollees , '' said Sarah Thomas , research director at the Deloitte Center for Health Solutions .`` I would n't be surprised to see higher rates in markets where there 's not as much competition . But I also would n't be surprised if it 's not as bad as some of the CEOs are making out , '' she said .The highest rate increases are expected among states whose marketplaces have little competition between insurers , low enrollment and hands-off regulators who do little to influence insurer decisions .Another contributing factor could be a decision by states to allow insurers to keep older health plans on the market that do not comply with Obamacare , an option offered by the President following a public outcry over policy cancellations .`` In California , where enrollment has been so strong , it 'll probably be easier for actuaries to feel confident about their pricing , versus states where enrollment is very anemic , '' said Dan Mendelson , chief executive at the consulting firm Avalere Health .One metric of enrollment success - and a potential indicator of future rate increases - is market penetration . In 16 states , sign-ups represent less than 10 percent of the potential marketplace population , according to a Kaiser Family Foundation study of enrollment data released by the administration on March 1 . Analysts say those markets could skew toward older , sicker members , which raises the likelihood of rate increases .The list includes Republican-led states that have rejected Obamacare : Louisiana , Texas , Kansas and Oklahoma . But also on the list are Democratic states with marketplaces that have been stalled by technology problems : Massachusetts , Hawaii and Maryland .At the top of the enrollment success scale , Kaiser found that Vermont has enrolled 54 percent of its potential market , while California , Idaho , Maine , Michigan , New York , Rhode Island and Washington have each enrolled about 20 percent or more .( Reporting by David Morgan in Washington and Caroline Humer in New York ; Editing by Michele Gershberg , Bernard Orr )"
1	"( Reuters ) - U.S. insurers planning to sell 2015 Obamacare health plans expect at least 20 percent growth in customers and in some states anticipate more than doubling sign-ups .In interviews with Reuters , half a dozen privately held and non-profit health insurers around the country say they are expecting this growth based on interest from potential customers they are hearing about through their call centers , sales forces and brokers .With the start of enrollment barely two weeks away , their assessment is dramatically different from a year ago , when it was unclear how many Americans would apply for the brand new insurance and income-based subsidies offered under President Barack Obamas healthcare law .Despite crippling technology issues with the HealthCare.gov website , more than 7 million people signed up for Obamacare plans in 2014 .In Florida , Jason Alford , sales director at Health First Health Plans Inc , expects to more than double customers in Affordable Care Act compliant plans from the 4,400 it signed up this year .`` We 've just talked to so many people in the market who for one of 5 or 6 different reasons did n't enroll in 2014 . We had many folks call this summer who really do n't understand the open enrollment period . They are calling in August to sign up for a plan because they think it 's all-year enrollment , '' he explained .When the three-month enrollment period opens on Nov. 15 , it will be a critical juncture for insurers who need to build profitable businesses that can stand up as government financial supports to insurers who sell these plans decline in the next two years .Aimed at extending health insurance to 25 million people , the law has been controversial for its cost to taxpayers and the changes it has spurred in coverage . Millions of individual plans were canceled for 2014 and some employers stopped insuring part-time workers .Support for the law tends to fall along political lines and has waned overall , polls say . Public support fell to 40 percent in 2014 , from 44 percent in 2012 and 42 percent in 2010 , Harvard researchers said this week .The exchanges have become a big business for insurers like Aetna Inc and WellPoint Inc , who enrolled hundreds of thousands of new customers last year . UnitedHealth Group Inc , barely on the exchanges in 2014 , will be in two dozen states . These insurers have not discussed 2015 forecasts .There is political importance for Obama as well . The Congressional Budget Office expects 13 million people to buy exchange plans in 2015 and 24 million in 2016 . If those numbers materialize , it will make it even more difficult for Republicans and other foes to uproot the embattled law .Insurers would not say whether they agreed with CBO forecasts , but many interviewed by Reuters have doubled or tripled staffing to handle applicants . Some saw customer calls up 30 percent in October . Only those with qualifying events such as job loss can buy insurance outside the regular enrollment period .In Pennsylvania , where Medicaid is being expanded , Independence Blue Cross hopes to add about 30,000 new customers to the 165,000 it signed up for 2014 plans .`` We 're thinking pretty positive . Last week we saw our call center activity increase 31 percent from a call volume standpoint versus the previous few weeks , '' Brian Lobley , a senior vice president at Independence Blue Cross in Pennsylvania , said in an interview .Lobley is seeing growth at a slower pace than CBO suggests because some customers may qualify for benefits under Medicaid when the state makes it available for more residents .In Texas , one small insurer predicts growth of 15,000 to 40,000 more customers from the fewer than 500 it signed up last year .Non-profit insurer Community Health Choice Inc in Houston priced premium rates too high and was mostly shut out in 2014 , said Daisy Morales , vice president of marketing . This year , with more competitive premiums , it expects to win new customers by gaining market share and because of forecasts for growth in the state . The insurer foresees one million new sign-ups in Texas in addition to the more than 700,000 who enrolled in 2014 .`` It 's not like we 're starting from scratch , like we were last year , '' Morales said .( Reporting by Caroline Humer ; additional reporting by David Morgan in Washington ; editing by Gunna Dickson )"
1	"( Reuters ) - Virginia 's Republican-controlled legislature passed a two-year budget late on Thursday that shot down the Democratic governor 's proposal to expand Medicaid and closed a $ 1.55 billion revenue shortfall .Expanding Medicaid , the health insurance program for low-income people , to about 400,000 Virginians under the federal Affordable Care Act had been Governor Terry McAuliffe 's chief legislative priority . He has not said whether he will approve the lawmakers ' spending plan .McAuliffe , in a stand-off for months with Republicans , had linked the budget to Medicaid expansion . The impasse was broken this week when a Democratic state senator said he resigned to secure his daughter a judgeship , giving the Republicans control of the upper chamber .The Senate passed the spending plan 21-18 , and the House of Delegates voted for it 69-31 . A July 1 government shutdown looms if a budget is not approved .`` When this budget reaches my desk I will evaluate it carefully and take the actions that I deem necessary , '' McAuliffe said in a statement on Friday . `` But this fight is far from over . ''The Affordable Care Act , launched in October and also known as Obamacare , is designed to extend health coverage to uninsured Americans through subsidized private health insurance and by expanding Medicaid coverage . Medicaid is run by states but overseen by the federal government .The U.S. Supreme Court has allowed states to opt out of Medicaid expansion . Obamacare is unpopular among Republicans and has become a campaign issue ahead of the November midterm congressional elections .The budget bill would slash spending by nearly $ 900 million and tap a state reserve fund to cover the shortfall .( Reporting by John Clarke ; Editing by Ian Simpson and Dan Grebler )"
1	"( Reuters ) - When Washington eliminated corporate tax deductions on health insurance executive compensation above $ 500,000 under President Barack Obama 's healthcare reform law in 2013 , it generated more than $ 72 million in additional tax revenue for the U.S. government , a left-leaning think tank said on Wednesday .The report from the Institute for Policy Studies examined executive compensation in the 2013 proxy filings from WellPoint Inc and UnitedHealth Group Inc , among others , and found that those companies paid more taxes than they would have if the law had not been passed .The study , written by a team that focuses on executive compensation issues , provides a look into how much revenue the government could raise if it eliminated this deduction more broadly .After examining the 10 largest publicly traded health insurers , it found that corporate taxes on their pay would likely increase in coming years because some 2013 compensation included stock options that predated the law .Based on those disclosures , it calculated the corporate tax each company paid on the compensation of the top five executives versus what the companies would have paid based on the U.S. tax code that applied to insurers prior to 2013 and that continues to be used by most other U.S. corporations outside of the health insurance industry .The report said that if all corporations were to be taxed this way , it would raise $ 50 billion more in revenue for the U.S. government .`` I do see real momentum in applying this across the board , '' Sarah Anderson , Global Economy Project Director at the institute and a report author , said . `` The report shows that the sky is not falling on these companies . ''Health insurers have been at the center of the national healthcare reform law , which has set new benefit standards for coverage , changed government payments for private Medicare benefits , expanded Medicaid to more income levels and created a new type of health insurance for individuals .The law also instituted limits on insurer profit and created new premium rate review procedures and taxes for insurers and corporations .Brendan Buck , a spokesman for the insurance industry 's largest lobbying group , America 's Health Insurance Plans , said , `` Requiring plans to pay higher taxes does nothing to make coverage more affordable or accessible . ''The nation 's biggest health insurer , UnitedHealth , had the largest change in corporate tax payments under the new rules , according to the report . It paid $ 19 million more in corporate taxes , based on a rate of 35 percent .WellPoint lowered its 2013 corporate tax bill by more than $ 1.5 million by accelerating the vesting of executive stock awards into late 2012 just before the reform took place , the report said . The company , which reported compensation on six executives in its proxy , paid about $ 10 million more in corporate taxes in 2013 than it would have under the old rules .WellPoint declined to comment . UnitedHealth was not immediately available .( Reporting by Caroline Humer in New York ; editing by Matthew Lewis )"

1	"12:31 p.m. | Updated Mitt Romney declared Thursday that he would act to repeal Obamacare if he was elected president , saying that he agreed with the dissenting justices in the Supreme Court ruling on Thursday .With the Capitol over his shoulder and standing in front of a podium with a sign that read Repeal and Replace Obamacare ,  Mr. Romney said the health of the American economy depended on getting rid of the health care law .Our mission is clear : if we want to get rid of Obamacare , we are going to have to replace President Obama ,  Mr. Romney said . That is my mission . That is our work . And Im asking the American people to join me.Mr. Romney said the courts ruling underscored the choice before American voters , one that he said was between bigger government that could take away health insurance choices or a Republican plan to preserve them .We have to make sure that people who want to keep their current insurance will be able to do so ,  Mr. Romney said in the brief statement . This is now the time for the American people to make a choice.Mr. Romney might have been hoping for a different court decision , but his campaign staff was not complaining .No question that politically it is a huge energizer ,  said a top campaign aide , speaking on the condition of anonymity to speak more freely about the campaigns thinking . Politically it is a big positive for Romney campaign.Mr. Romneys promise to repeal the presidents health care plan in his standard stump speech always gets applause , and now Mr. Romney can tie repeal to the November election . If we want to get rid of Obamacare , were going to have to replace President Obama ,  Mr. Romney said Thursday afternoon , offering a line that his aides are already echoing .Mr. Romney can be nuanced , which has tripped him up at times . But his campaign prefers one or two simple arguments ( see : jobs and the economy ) , and they seem to have found another one in the ruling on Thursday : Repeal Obamacare/replace President Obama ) .Romney aides expect that the courts decision will revitalize their base , creating an intensity and energy similar to the 2010 midterm elections , when many Republicans ran against the presidents health care plan and the party retook the House .From the time the ruling was announced until Thursday afternoon , the campaign had raised more that $ 375,000 in donations .Mr. Romney learned of the decision in his hotel room at the Washington Hilton , where he watched coverage of the ruling on television . Some of his top aides  including Russ Schrieffer , a chief strategist ; Neil Newhouse , the campaigns pollster ; Lanhee Chen , the policy director ; and Katie Packer Gage , the deputy campaign manager  were also on hand in Washington .The campaign had kept the details of Mr. Romneys announcement a secret until the last minute and had reporters gather at the Hilton for a bus ride to a location that remained T.B.D. until less than an hour before Mr. Romney made his remarks . Television correspondents broadcasting from in front of the podium where Mr. Romney was set to speak were not allowed to disclose the location .Though Mr. Romney had prepared several possible responses to the likely outcomes , which he previewed at campaign events in Virginia this week , many in the campaign were privately surprised that the court had not overturned the mandate portion of the presidents health care plan .Mr. Romney spoke shortly before noon on the rooftop of 101 Constitution , an office building in the shadow of the Capitol that also houses a Charlie Palmer steakhouse . The mood was subdued as the news media waited for Mr. Romney to arrive , and the candidate himself was equally sedate .He spoke for just over four minutes ."
1	"12:46 p.m. | Updated Gov . Rick Perry of Texas , still reeling from a debate performance that upset many of the bedrock conservatives he considers his base , came out swinging Friday against his rival Mitt Romney , accusing the former Massachusetts governor of backing policies indistinguishable from those of President Obama and having paved the way for Obamacare.While Mr. Perry has already been sharply critical of Mr. Romney and his health care record , the Texans speech before the Georgia Public Policy Foundation was a more intensive critique and seemed to reflect a strategy to undercut Mr. Romneys attempts to draw away Perry supporters and other Republican voters .Now , he seems to be angling to convince G.O.P . primary voters that they can not trust Mr. Romney on almost anything . While his speech was billed as a domestic policy address , he offered little in the way of policy proposals and instead focused on attacking the Obama administration and Mr. Romney .What we are seeing in America today is a conservative awakening , a revival born out of a deep concern that liberals have used the machinery of the federal government to impose a nanny state that limits our freedom and that targets free enterprise ,  Mr. Perry said , according to The Associated Press .I knew when I got into this race I would have my hands full fighting President Obamas big government agenda ,  he adds . I just didnt think it would be in the Republican primary.Ryan Williams , a spokesman for Mr. Romney , accused Mr. Perry of misleading voters .Governor Perry is desperate to shift attention away from his liberal policies that encourage illegal immigration ,  Mr. Williams said . His repeated use of distortions and fabrications on the campaign trail shows that Rick Perry cant be trusted to tell the truth.Mr. Perrys remarks come as he is also trying to win back conservative Republican primary voters who may be giving him second thoughts because of his record on issues like and vaccinating teenage girls against the human papillomavirus , or HPV .On Wednesday , Mr. Perry backpedaled from a statement in the most recent Republican debate that those who disagree with his immigration stance were heartless . He now describes the comment as inappropriate.Ashley Parker contributed reporting to this post ."
1	"2:41 p.m. | Updated Rick Santorum used the backdrop of the Supreme Courts hearings on the health care law Monday to slam Mitt Romney as a compromised candidate who all but inspired President Obama to overhaul the nations health care system .Standing in front of the court after the first of three days of arguments about the constitutionality of the law Republicans call Obamacare ,  Mr. Santorum mocked Mr. Romney for campaigning across the continent , in San Diego , instead of showing up at the court to protest .Theres one candidate who is uniquely disqualified to make the case against Mr. Obamas health care law , Mr. Santorum declared as supporters of the law chanted Health care is a right !  in the background . Its why Im here and hes not.The accusation was a reprise of comments over the weekend in which Mr. Santorum angrily said Mr. Romney is the worst Republican in the country to go up against Mr. Obama on the need to repeal the health care law .Trailing badly in the chase for delegates as he battles Mr. Romney , Mr. Santorum is trying to tap into the intense anger among conservatives about the health care law . He is trying to make the case that there is little philosophical difference between Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney .But that task has proved tricky for Mr. Santorum , who seemed to suggest last week that if Mr. Romney were the nominee , voters would be better off sticking with Mr. Obama in the White House . Mr. Santorum later said his words were taken out of context and denied that he would ever support Mr. Obama over a Republican .On Monday , Mr. Santorum said he did not regret calling Mr. Romney the worst Republican on the health care issue , saying that Mr. Romneys support in Massachusetts for health care mandates  the heart of the case at the Supreme Court  would make it impossible for him to wage an effective campaign against the president in the fall .Hes the worst candidate to go against Barack Obama . He cant make it the argument ,  Mr. Santorum said . If he makes it the argument , the Obama machine will turn it right back on him.In an interview on CNN Monday afternoon , Mr. Romney dismissed Mr. Santorums criticisms , saying that Im not going to worry too much about what Rick is saying these days.He added that I will repeal Obamacare and I will stop it in its tracks on day one.In an earlier interview on CNN , Newt Gingrich conceded that he had once supported a health care mandate , but said he always demanded an opt-out for people who did not want to pay for health insurance .I always said there had to be an opt-out clause ,  Mr. Gingrich said . My guess is they are going to find it unconstitutional.On Sunday , Mr. Santorum used an expletive and criticized a New York Times reporter for seeking clarification about the worst Republican comments . Asked about his exchange with the reporter , Jeff Zeleny , Mr. Santorum said he had no regrets .I dont regret taking on a New York Times reporter who was out of line ,  Mr. Santorum said . If you are conservative and you havent taken on a New York Times reporter , you arent worth your salt.Mr. Santorums campaign used the exchange Sunday in an e-mailed fund-raising appeal on Monday .Mr. Romney held a campaign event Monday morning in California . But even as he stayed thousands of miles away from Washington , his campaign tried to shift the spotlight to Mr. Obamas absence , not his .Speaking at a medical device company in San Diego , Mr. Romney criticized the presidents reforms as burdensome on the health care industry .There are a lot of reasons not to like Obamacare ,  Mr. Romney said . Among them , of course , an extra trillion dollars of spending . We were told it would be an extra trillion . Now were told by the C.B.O . its more like two trillion dollars . And then they said it would cut the cost of health insurance . In fact it has increased the cost of health insurance.Mr. Romney did not  as he usually does  specifically call for the repeal of the health care law . And he did not mention Mr. Santorum or the arguments going on at the court . But he accused Mr. Obama and his allies of misleading the American people about what would happen after the law went into effect .There was the story that Obamacare , if you wanted to keep your current insurance , you could ,  he said . But now we find out that some 30 percent of employers in America say that when it goes into effect they will drop their employee coverage , and instead have them go to Obamacare.Ashley Parker and Sabrina Tavernise contributed reporting ."
1	"A Tea Party commission trying to crowd-source a plan to reduce the federal budget deficit says it found broad support for repealing the health care legislation passed last year and eliminating entire federal departments , but much less enthusiasm for changes to Medicare and Social Security .Those programs are two of the biggest contributors to the nations deficit . Still , the Tea Party Debt Commission says that its proposals , which will be released in preliminary form on Tuesday , add up to $ 6 trillion in savings over 10 years  more than the reductions proposed by President Obama , or Representative Paul Ryan , a Republican from Wisconsin who is the chairman of the House Budget Committee , or the report of a bipartisan commission last year .The Tea Party commission is hoping that with the help of conservative senators , it can influence the work of a bipartisan panel of 12 lawmakers that has been charged with finding at least $ 1.2 trillion in cuts over the next decade .A copy of the preliminary findings was provided to The New York Times . A more formal report of the commissions plans will be presented at a hearing on Capitol Hill on Nov. 17  a week before the bipartisan panel is expected to complete its recommendations .The Tea Party commission was formed by FreedomWorks , the libertarian advocacy group that is led by Dick Armey , the former House majority leader , and was one of the first organizations to cultivate the Tea Party . FreedomWorks named 12 commissioners and held nine hearings across the country where it gave presentations on the budget deficit and solicited ideas on how to cut it .The group also set up a Web site on which people were presented a series of choices about what to cut from the budget .What were trying to prove ,  said Adam Brandon , a spokesman for FreedomWorks , is that No . 1 , theres popular support for cuts , and that No . 2 , it is possible to make the cuts that were talking about without raising new revenue.The commissions preliminary recommendations tend to be ideas that conservatives have long supported . The FreedomWorks presentation argued that raising taxes could not balance the budget .The menu of choices on the debt commission Web site did not include options Democrats have suggested ; for instance , requiring hedge fund managers to pay ordinary tax rates , rather than the lower 15 percent they pay now on so-called carried interest income .Instead , would-be budget architects were offered stark choices : Would you prefer to reduce Social Security benefits for those with high incomes or raise the retirement age for Social Security to 70 ? End all foreign aid or eliminate the Department of Energy ? Eliminate ethanol tax credits or end farm subsidies ? Other proposals included privatizing air traffic control , reducing the pay for federal employees by 10 percent and eliminating AmeriCorps , the youth volunteer program .A FreedomWorks memo on the preliminary findings said that more than 40,000 people visited the Web site to make recommendations for cuts .The most popular idea , supported by 93 percent , was repealing what the site referred to as Obamacare ,  the health care overhaul legislation passed in March 2010 . After that , the most popular ideas were reducing duplicative purchases of Pentagon supplies ( 90 percent ) , eliminating the Department of Education and privatizing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ( 81 percent each ) , and reducing discretionary spending to 2008 levels ( 76 percent ) .When it comes to cutting Medicare , Medicaid and Social Security , the report said visitors to the site were more cautious ,  and prefer reductions in peripheral elements ,  like tightening eligibility for Social Security disability payments and reducing subsidies to teaching hospitals .The report said that the top 10 choices would add up to $ 6 trillion in savings . But some of these proposals are vague or subject to year-to-year change ( selling underused federal buildings , ending earmarks ) . Others are subject to dispute : FreedomWorks says that repealing the health care legislation would cut $ 1.2 trillion , but the Congressional Budget Office has projected that repealing the legislation would actually increase the deficit by $ 210 billion over the next 10 years .Still , the report offers some sense of how the Tea Party might influence the debate when the joint Congressional panel makes its recommendations in November .The staff of Senator Mike Lee of Utah , a Republican who was elected last year with heavy Tea Party support , will conduct the November hearing on the Tea Party plan .The 12-member Congressional committee , named as part of the deficit reduction deal in August , will release its proposal for at least $ 1.2 trillion in cuts over 10 years by Nov. 23 . If a majority of its members can agree , the House and Senate must vote on their proposal by Dec. 23 ."
1	"A Times reader , Tom Bird , of East Lansing , Mich. , raised a timely issue , given all thats happening in Washington . He wrote that other news organizations , including The Associated Press , are putting the expression Obamacare in quotation marks , signifying that it is not a neutral expression , but instead is political rhetoric that is being used in a partisan way. And he added , When will The Times wake up ? A quick search of Times news stories turned up only one recent example of the phrase being used in the manner Mr. Bird mentioned . It came in a prototypically Times-like headline on the front of the Sunday business section : On the Threshold of Obamacare , Warily. ( The word also appears regularly , without quotes , on the Economix blog where one recent headline read : How to Gut Obamacare. )But , for the most part , the news pages are using what I view as the equivalent of quotation marks  a description of the phrase , which provides the same kind of distance as quotation marks would . Heres an example: federal officials declined to discuss whether they had found design flaws in their system , but their comments appeared to place most of the blame on the sheer volume of traffic . They pronounced themselves pleased , saying that the intense interest showed a pent-up demand that demonstrated the need for the Affordable Care Act , the 2010 law known as Obamacare , which created the exchanges .I asked Philip B. Corbett , the associate managing editor for standards , about the guidelines for the expression in the news pages . For the most part , we have not used Obamacare as our standard term in news stories outside of quotations ,  he said . Aside from the question of whether its politically charged , the term strikes me as informal  essentially a nickname  which is not our normal style for straight news articles . Most often we simply use a straightforward description , like the health care law or the health care overhaul ,  or occasionally the formal name , the Affordable Care Act.However , in the opinion pages of The Times , where different style guidelines often apply , many examples crop up of Obamacare without quotation marks or description . Columnists including Frank Bruni , Charles Blow and Paul Krugman have used the phrase  acceptably , I think  in the context of their overall viewpoints and individual voices .A reader , Paul Teichert , in mentioning a Joe Nocera column in which the phrase was used , expressed his displeasure : Why become part of the conservative media echo chamber ?  he wrote . I wish that in future The Times would adopt a policy of calling it solely the Affordable Care Act rather than sounding like those who have disdain for the act and our president.As for just how politically charged the phrase is , that can be debated . A look back to last year found a Times article about leading Democrats change of heart in embracing the term . Even the president seemed to be picking it up .Of course , that was then . Just last week , the ABC talk show host Jimmy Kimmel sent a camera crew out to the streets to query citizens about whether they preferred Obamacare or the Affordable Care Act . They may mean one and the same thing , but people reacted negatively to the first and more positively to the second .Thats far from a scientific poll , of course , but it makes the point that  as The Timess readers point out  language choice matters ."
1	"A college student came to me recently with a quandary . Hed spent the summer interning at a conservative think tank . Now he was applying to schools and companies where most people were liberal . Should he remove the internship from his rsum ?I advised him not to . Even if people disagreed with his politics , I argued , theyd still appreciate his public spiritedness . But now Im thinking that advice was wrong . Theres a lot more political discrimination than I thought . In fact , the best recent research suggests that theres more political discrimination than there is racial discrimination .For example , political scientists Shanto Iyengar and Sean Westwood gave 1,000 people student rsums and asked them which students should get scholarships . The rsums had some racial cues ( membership in African-American Students Association ) and some political cues ( member of Young Republicans ) .Race influenced decisions . Blacks favored black students 73 percent to 27 percent , and whites favored black students slightly . But political cues were more powerful . Both Democrats and Republicans favored students who agreed with them 80 percent of the time . They favored students from their party even when other students had better credentials .Iyengar and Westwood conducted other experiments to measure what Cass Sunstein of Harvard Law School calls partyism. They gave subjects implicit association tests , which measure whether people associate different qualities with positive or negative emotions . They had people play the trust game , which measures how much people are willing to trust different kinds of people .In those situations , they found pervasive prejudice . And political biases were stronger than their racial biases .In a Bloomberg View column last month , Sunstein pointed to polling data that captured the same phenomenon . In 1960 , roughly 5 percent of Republicans and Democrats said theyd be displeased if their child married someone from the other party . By 2010 , 49 percent of Republicans and 33 percent of Democrats said they would mind .Politics is obviously a passionate activity , in which moral values clash . Debates over Obamacare , charter schools or whether the United States should intervene in Syria stir serious disagreement . But these studies are measuring something different . Peoples essential worth is being measured by a political label : whether they should be hired , married , trusted or discriminated against .The broad social phenomenon is that as personal life is being de-moralized , political life is being hyper-moralized . People are less judgmental about different lifestyles , but they are more judgmental about policy labels .The features of the hyper-moralized mind-set are all around . More people are building their communal and social identities around political labels . Your political label becomes the prerequisite for membership in your social set .Politics becomes a marker for basic decency . Those who are not members of the right party are deemed to lack basic compassion , or basic loyalty to country .Finally , political issues are no longer just about themselves ; they are symbols of worth and dignity . When many rural people defend gun rights , theyre defending the dignity and respect of rural values against urban snobbery .There are several reasons politics has become hyper-moralized in this way . First , straight moral discussion has atrophied . There used to be public theologians and philosophers who discussed moral issues directly . That kind of public intellectual is no longer prominent , so moral discussion is now done under the guise of policy disagreement , often by political talk-show hosts .Second , highly educated people are more likely to define themselves by what they believe than by their family religion , ethnic identity or region .Third , political campaigns and media provocateurs build loyalty by spreading the message that electoral disputes are not about whether the top tax rate will be 36 percent or 39 percent , but are about the existential fabric of life itself .The problem is that hyper-moralization destroys politics . Most of the time , politics is a battle between competing interests or an attempt to balance partial truths . But in this fervent state , it turns into a Manichaean struggle of light and darkness . To compromise is to betray your very identity . When schools , community groups and workplaces get defined by political membership , when speakers get disinvited from campus because they are beyond the pale , then every community gets dumber because they cant reap the benefits of diverging viewpoints and competing thought .This mentality also ruins human interaction . There is a tremendous variety of human beings within each political party . To judge human beings on political labels is to deny and ignore what is most important about them . It is to profoundly devalue them . That is the core sin of prejudice , whether it is racism or partyism .The personal is not political . If youre judging a potential daughter-in-law on political grounds , your values are out of whack ."
1	"A few weeks ago , Ezra Klein and Ben Domenech had a fairly detailed back-and-forth  culminating in this mano-a-mano exchange  about whether a Republican or conservative alternative to Obamacare actually exists .

Nearly all of the plausible conservative blueprints for reform involve increased funding for high-risk pools where people with pre-existing conditions can purchase insurance , as an alternative to regulations requiring that insurers cover all applicants regardless of their health status . These pools exist under Obamacare as well , but theyre purely transitional and deeply underfunded  and this underfunding provided an opportunity that Eric Cantor and the House Republican leadership tried to exploit last week , with a bill that would have shifted $ 3.6 billion in money thats basically being used as the Health and Human Services Departments discretionary fund into the federal high-risk pool instead .Instead , the bill died because , well , too many House Republicans didnt want to vote for it . Ill let Domenech explain the policy and political malpractice at work here ( the quote is from his email newsletter , The Transom ) :The Cantor-sponsored shift wouldve accomplished a couple of political goals : it wouldve bolstered a high-risk pool based approach to pre-existing conditions , which has generally been favored on the right , and it wouldve hampered Sebeliuss ability to shift dollars around at whim without going back to Congress for approval . As such , it seems a logical move which doesnt wed Republicans to any long term policy positions regarding Obamacare As they tend to do , however , fiscal conservatives split on Cantor effort .

Whatever the motives of the conservatives who opposed this measure , they have accomplished the following ultimate goal : theyve made leadership less likely to take up any possible wedge legislation on implementation ; theyve missed an opportunity to bolster the argument that Republicans care about pre-existing conditions ; and , most importantly , theyve made it easier for Sebelius to implement the law So what were opponents thinking ? Well , heres one opponents explanation:The issue I think many of us are having with this particular piece of legislation  youre replacing one big government program with another big government program ,  said Representative Raul Labrador of Idaho  he added : Subsidizing health care is not what Republicans should be about . Republicans should be about managing health care to lower costs for Americans .And therein lies the rub , because you cant actually have a conservative alternative to Obamacare if you cant recognize that managing the health care system requires changing the way it ( already , pre-Obama ! ) subsidizes health care , which in turn requires increasing the subsidies available to at least some people ( the sick , and Americans who dont get insurance through their employers ) even as you reduce them for others ( by capping the deduction for health insurance , as a first step ) . Its true that this kind of change is a big government program relative to the libertarian utopia , but relative to the status quo its nothing of the sort , and anyway I dont see many Republican congressmen casting bold votes to actually eliminate the health-insurance tax exclusion . Instead , theyre happy to just pretend that the existing system represents some sort of free-market ideal in order to score points against the new health care law and avoid taking on any policy risk themselves  and then happy , as in this case , to demagogue as big government any constructive steps toward a world thats actually more consonant with free market principles than the status quo .This , this , is the Republican Partys health care problem . It isnt that conservative ideas about health policy dont exist , and it isnt that they wont work . Its that right now the feasibility question is purely academic , because even after five years of debating these issues , and despite Eric Cantors best efforts , there still arent enough Republican lawmakers willing to take even the smallest of steps toward putting those ideas to the test .

1	"A few weeks out from Election Day 2014 , some Democrats running for re-election to the United States Senate in heavily Republican states are running away from President Obamas record .And boy , a lot of New York Times readers are fed up .Just once Id like to hear a Democratic Senate candidate point out that millions now have health care when they did not before ,  Robert Zisgen wrote from Mahwah , N.J .Mr. Obama ended two wars and thus is saving blood and treasure ,  Mr. Zisgen continued . Perhaps they could mention that the stock market has done very well.But no . Instead , when asked about their votes in support of Mr. Obamas agenda , some candidates are asking , President who ? So it was that readers provided a barometer of President Obamas low approval ratings and a sense of frustration with Democratic candidates in comments on Wednesdays lead editorial , The Democratic Panic : Alison Lundergan Grimes , Kay Hagan and Other Candidates Avoid Obama. The Times received 1,554 comments and published 1,134 . A majority expressed frustration with Democrats lack of enthusiasm for Democratic policy . Some expressed pride in the president . And others shared the Republican hope that Democrats will end up with what they see as a well-deserved defeat .The panicky Democratic flight away from President Obama  and from some of the partys most important positions  is not a surprise ,  the editorial board wrote . Mr . Obama remains highly unpopular among white voters , particularly in Southern states.Thus , its a challenge to assemble a winning coalition for incumbent Democrats such as Senators Mark Pryor of Arkansas ; Mark Begich in Alaska ; Mary Landrieu of Louisiana ; and Kay Hagan of North Carolina . Alison Lundergan Grimes , a Senate candidate in Kentucky , and Michelle Nunn in Georgia are also running as centrists and eschewing comparisons to the president .Many readers said that offering weak Democratic broth , or trying to blend in politically with Republicans , is bad strategy and poor inspiration for apathetic voters .As we say out here , the only thing in the middle of the road are lane lines and road kill ,  P Robison wrote from Wyoming . Really , who cares if we get Republican or Republican-Lite ? Some readers said Democrats are merely reaping the political consequences of Mr. Obamas unpopular policies .They helped vote him in and now have to live with the consequences of his failed policies , the damage done to this great country and to their own campaigns ,  Chuck in Houston wrote . Maybe they should own up to it.Voters on the liberal side of the spectrum expressed disappointment , but for different reasons . As the editorial board wrote : By not standing firmly for their own policies , Democrats send a message to voters that the unending Republican criticism of the president is legitimate.Many readers shared that assessment . The problem is the failure of his colleagues in Congress and the Democratic Party to stand beside the president , Colleen Gillard wrote from Cambridge , Mass . Cant think of another Democratic president in history who has been so abandoned.Others advised Democrats to get a backbone ,  as one reader put it .A few readers pointed out that Democrats face special challenges in off-year elections , when they must appeal to centrists , as Democratic voters historically have turned out at lower rates than Republicans .That dynamic among likely voters weakens the appeal of the Affordable Care Act , for example , which the editorial board described as one of the most far-reaching and beneficial laws to have been passed by Congress in years.I suspect part of the problem is that the beneficiaries of Obamacare are disproportionately members of groups ( young , low-income , etc . ) regarded as having a relatively low propensity to vote , particularly in mid-terms ,  Paul McDonough wrote from California .Several readers said Democrats need a fundamental change in tactics . The Democrats are running on fear rather than expressing outrage , as President Harry Truman did so successfully ,  Paul wrote from Long Island .Some said Democrats making weak policy arguments are just laying the groundwork for policy failure .Cowards ,  Tom J. in Berwyn wrote . Even if they win , we get a Senate full of more cowards , who let a Republican minority steamroll over everything.Democrats sense of being dispirited ran through many comments .These Democratic politicians stand for self perpetuation without regard to integrity ,  Corrinna in Boulder , Colo. , wrote . I can barely bring myself to vote.Still , some readers agreed with the editorial boards view that the stimulus bill was vital in pulling the country out of the recession , and there is much that is going right in this country.Like him or not , the economy is steadily improving and more Americans have health insurance ,  Margaret Bradley in Fayetteville , Ga. , wrote . Im sure those auto workers were happy to get their jobs back."
1	"A group seeking to persuade young people to opt out of President Obamas health care law posted videos on YouTube Thursday that show young patients on exam tables recoiling in fear as a character the group is calling Creepy Uncle Sam appears out of nowhere and looms over them .The group , Generation Opportunity , said in a news release that the videos were part of a new , six-figure campaign to educate people between the ages of 18 and 29 about alternatives to expensive and creepy Obamacare exchanges.Starting Oct. 1 , uninsured Americans will be able to shop for health insurance through new online markets , or exchanges , in every state . Many low- and middle-income people will qualify for federal subsidies to help cover the cost . The Obama administration is eager for healthy young people to enroll in the exchanges , to help offset the cost of insuring older and sicker people .Evan Feinberg , the president of Generation Opportunity , said in an interview that the group would spend close to three-quarters of a million dollars on the campaign , which will include not just online videos but also events at college football games , music festivals and other gatherings that tend to draw young adults . The group will ask young people to pledge not to sign up for insurance through the exchanges , Mr. Feinberg said .We talk to folks on a daily basis about what their options are  that they have ability to pay the penalty and buy health coverage that better meets their needs and their budget ,  he said .Under the Affordable Care Act , starting in January , most Americans who do not have health insurance will have to pay a tax penalty . In the first year , it will be $ 95 , or 1 percent of family income , whichever is higher .Generation Opportunity is based in Virginia , but Mr. Feinberg said the campaign would be national . The group received $ 5 million last year from Freedom Partners , a nonprofit with ties to Charles G. and David H. Koch , according to tax filings . Mr. Feinberg said he worked at the Charles Koch Institute before joining Generation Opportunity earlier this year .One of the videos shows a nurse escorting a young woman into an exam room , saying , I see you chose to sign up for Obamacare. It then shows the young woman in a hospital gown , putting her feet in stirrups for a gynecological exam . Then the Uncle Sam character pops up at the end of the exam table , the young woman screams , and the words , Dont let government play doctor and Opt out of Obamacare flash on the screen .The videos quickly drew criticism from supporters of the health care law . Brad Woodhouse , president of Americans United for Change , a left-leaning advocacy group , called them sick , dishonest , vile and dangerous ads to scare young people into going without health insurance.Ilyse Hogue , president of Naral Pro-Choice America , said in a statement that the video featuring the young woman not only defiles our American mascot but disturbingly compared the A.C.A . to sexual assault.Mr. Feinberg dismissed such criticism , saying , All the ad suggests is that Uncle Sam will play doctor.He added : Ill tell you this , we got some early feedback from folks on college campuses . A lot of people are planning on dressing as Creepy Uncle Sam for Halloween."
1	"A paradox of American politics is that Republicans take organized labor more seriously than Democrats do .The right sees unions as a mainstay of the left , a crucial source of cash , campaign manpower and votes .Unions are the largest player in American politics and they will be for some time ,  Grover Norquist , the president of Americans for Tax Reform , declared in March at the Conservative Political Action Conference . Fourteen million Americans have to pay union dues . If they average $ 500 , and that is a low estimate , thats a $ 7 billion slush fund for the left.Democrats are happy to get labors votes and money , but they have done little to revitalize the besieged movement .The unions basically have become an A.T.M . for Democrats ,  Steve Rosenthal , a former political director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. , told me in a phone conversation . There is a sense of taking unions for granted , no place else to go , dont need to do much for them.Republicans are willing to go to great lengths to weaken the union movement , especially at the state level . Even as the strength of organized labor as a whole declines , conservatives view unions that represent public sector employees , in particular , as anathema . They are desperate to gut the power of the 7.2 million organized government workers  who range from teachers , to clerks in the Department of Motor Vehicles , to social workers , public hospital employees , meat and poultry inspectors , road workers , property tax auditors and civil servants in general . These are the employees who populate the extensive bureaucracies that the right loathes .Unions the right has targeted include the American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees , the Service Employees International Union , the American Federation of Government Employees , the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers .Reince Priebus , chairman of the Republican National Committee , appearing at the same C.P.A.C . event as Norquist , boasted that in Wisconsin the successful drive to render public sector unions impotent was the result of a coordinated effort between the party and the conservative movement:The anti-union alliance between the Republican Party and movement conservatives got a big boost on Nov. 4 . The heroes of this anti-union drive , Scott Walker , the governor of Wisconsin , and Rick Snyder , the governor of Michigan , were re-elected in states with a long history of strong labor movements . Prospects for the enactment of additional anti-labor legislation also improved as Republicans made substantial gains in legislatures and governors races across the country .After the 2010 election , Republicans had complete control ( governor and both legislative branches ) in 21 states , almost double the 11 states with complete Democatic control . Now , 24 states are fully in Republican hands ; Democrats dominate in just 7 .The 2014 election was a major political defeat for the unions , particularly state-wide public sector unions , because it shows how much the voting public sees unions as part of the problem of persistent unemployment and underemployment , rather than being part of the solution ,  Gary Chaison , a professor of industrial relations at Clark University , replied in response to my email . Chaisons assessment:By 2013 , 11.3 percent of wage and salary workers were covered by unions , down from 23.4 percent in 1983 .Republicans have good reason to target public sector unions . Without them , the share of the work force represented by unions would be even smaller than it is now . By last year , union coverage of private sector workers had fallen to 7.5 percent , from a high of roughly 35 percent in the mid-1950s . Government workers today make up 15.8 percent of the total work force , but union representation of this sliver has grown from less than 10 percent in the 1950s to 35.3 percent .Norquist told the C.P.A.C . conference that conservatives hadnt taken on public employee unions in the mistaken belief that you cant do anything about the public sector . The rules are set , and they elect the guys who set the rules. But Walkers success in winning a recall election , and in getting re-elected , has permanently changed thinking on the right , Norquist declared . By this reasoning , Walkers survival and ultimate triumph demonstrates that changing the rules to make it more difficult to organize public workers , to collect dues and to bargain over wages and fringe benefits is politically viable , even in a Northern state .In 2011 , when Walker first took office , 37 percent of the nations 21-plus million public sector employees were union members ; by 2012 , this dropped to 35.9 percent ; and last year , it fell to 35.3 percent .If Republicans and conservatives place a top priority on eviscerating labor unions , what is the Democratic Party doing to protect this core constituency ? Not much .In fact , the Obama administration has undermined the bargaining leverage of the most successful unions by imposing a 40 percent excise tax , which takes effect in 2018 , on health insurance premiums in excess of $ 10,200 annually for individuals , and $ 27,500 for families , in order to finance Obamacare . The provision , which covers what many of labors enemies call Cadillac plans ,  has provoked an angry response from labor leaders . They see the tax as threatening the continued survival of key health insurance benefits that unions have won as part of total employee compensation packages .In an email to me , Joel Parker , national vice president of the merged Transportation Communications International Union and International Association of Machinists , wrote about the consequences of the new excise tax:Democrats neglect the union movement at their peril . Not only does organized labor provide millions of dollars  the Center for Responsive Politics reports that unions spent $ 116.5 million on politics in 2013-14  but union members are a loyal Democratic constituency . On Nov. 4 , the 17 percent of voters who come from union households supported Democratic House candidates by a margin of 22 points , 60-38 , while the remaining 83 percent from non-union households supported Republicans 54-44 .Rosenthal , the former A.F.L.-C.I.O . political director , has compiled 2008 exit poll data showing that white men , white weekly churchgoers , gun owners , veterans and whites without college degrees who were union members cast majorities for Obama , while members of these usually strongly Republican groups who were nonunion backed John McCain , often by large margins .Gun owners , for example , backed McCain over Obama 62-37 , while gun owners who were members of unions backed Obama 56-44 . White men chose McCain over Obama 57-41 , but white men who were members of union households backed Obama 59-41 .The Democratic percentage among union voters has stayed consistently in the 60 percent range for the past two decades , but the absolute number of labor votes has dropped as membership has fallen . Organized labors share of the electorate has shrunk , according to Rosenthals data , from 27 percent in 2000 to 17 percent in 2014 .Rosenthal was struck by the comment made by one man during a focus group that he organized in New Brunswick , N.J. , in late 2012 . At the time , the states governor , Chris Christie , had been attacking both the state teachers union and public employee pension funds .This guy stood up and said My father is a cop , my brother is a cop . They have pensions , I dont , and it really pisses me off ,   Rosenthal recounted . Damn it , this guy was talking about his father and brother . He was pissed that his own father and brother had pensions.The comment reflects the success of the Republican strategy of pitting those who see themselves as taxpayers against public sector unions , viewed by many as takers .Christie has called the New Jersey Education Association a group of political thugs ,  a union that has become fat and rich and entitled.Walker , who was re-elected governor of Wisconsin with 52.3 percent to his opponents 46.6 percent , explicitly summarized the strategy when he first took office in January 2011:If , as many Democrats privately acknowledge , unions remain an important linchpin in the partys coalition , Democrats have their work cut out for them . The Republican drive to victory in state and local elections continues in defiance of large-scale demographic trends that are supposed to benefit Democrats .A vast majority of gubernatorial elections  39 states worth  are held in nonpresidential years when the electorate is smaller and more conservative than it is in presidential years , and it is at the state and local level where decisions crucial to the future of organized labor are made . Figure 1 , a map of Republican and Democratic House districts in the aftermath of the 2014 elections reflects the scope of Republican domination .The economic forces working against unions , especially private sector unions  globalization , the shift of income from labor to capital , foreign imports , automation , the decline of manufacturing jobs  are inexorable . The Republican Party recognizes this vulnerability and is taking steps to go in for the kill . For both Walker and Christie , attacks on public sector unions  confronting teachers is a specialty of both men  are crucial to their potential bids for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 .Democrats themselves  President Obama and members of Congress  recognize that the odds are against them . Even when the party had full control of both houses of Congress and the White House in 2009 , Democrats gave a less than halfhearted effort to pass labors top priority : legislation that would make elections for union representation easier .Democratic strategists looking toward the future are focused on the rising American electorate  single women , minorities and the young , with no reference to labor .At the same time , many voters in the Republican electorate are themselves middle and low income . In 2014 , 67 percent of those who cast Republican ballots earned less than $ 100,000 in household income ; 30.4 percent made less than $ 50,000 . Republicans face their own problems remaining competitive in presidential elections , which will only worsen if they do not strengthen their support among these less affluent voters .But even with labor unions no longer the force they were  and in fact in part because of their decline  the pressure will fall on both parties to more effectively represent the interests and rights of economically struggling voters , who at some point will refuse to tolerate their eroding income and lack of opportunity ."
1	"ALEXANDRIA , Va.  Last week , with the midterm elections fast approaching , the conservative website Independent Journal Review was not focused on the control of the Senate or crucial statehouse races . Instead , it led its home page with a gruesome beheading on Long Island and a video of a belligerent drunk being arrested at a Dallas airport .But sprinkled throughout the attention-grabbing fare was a steady stream of articles critical of President Obama and other Democrats . Obamas schedule from today shows how toxic he is to Democrats running for Senate ,  read one headline . Another asked , Did Hillary intentionally talk over a crowd singing Happy Birthday to her ?  ( The sub-headline : If elected president , she would be the second oldest in history. )IJReview , a two-year-old site started by a pair of Republican operatives , has emerged as one of the most popular online destinations for conservatives . The site mixes entertaining , shareable topics like pets through a conservative-values lens ( for example , a recent piece about a dog helping to heal a sick veteran ) with articles about politics and policy .Its like if you crossed RedState with BuzzFeed ,  said Alex Castellanos , a Republican political consultant and an adviser to IJReview .IJReview has roughly 24 million unique visitors a month , according to the most recent Quantcast rankings . Its traffic exceeds that of more seasoned right-wing sites like the Drudge Report , Newsmax and Breitbart News , and is not far behind other conservative brands like Fox News and TheBlaze .The sites founders , Alex Skatell and Phil Musser , say that its popularity comes from having mastered social sharing on websites like Facebook and Google . They boast of the ability to generate maximum traffic from a minimum number of articles . In August , for instance , IJReview received 14 million shares on Facebook from just 646 articles , according to NewsWhip , a site that tracks social sharing . By contrast , Huffington Post , the leader in Facebook shares , had four times as many shares at nearly 55 million , but with 38 times as many articles .Such a model has economic advantages . IJReview generates revenues in the low seven figures a month , up 500 percent from this time a year ago , the men said . The Media Group will earn revenue of $ 30 million this year , they said . While they declined to disclose their bottom line , Mr. Musser said , we have been profitable from Day 1.When Mr. Skatell , a former digital director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee , looked to start a site after the 2012 election , he saw a huge gap in reaching what he calls a more mainstream center-right audience. He teamed with Mr. Musser , a former executive director of the Republican Governors Association . The two bonded over being generally dispirited about our partys approach to all things digital ,  Mr. Musser said .They pledged to change things . We shared a goal of building a new ecosystem to communicate our message ,  Mr. Musser said , and to develop practitioners who could deliver it. Mr. Skatell , 28 , had already earned a reputation as a digital wunderkind in the Republican Party . At 22 , he started the Republican Governors Associations first Facebook page and increased online fund-raising .He had also started his own Facebook page , called Conservative Daily , that aggregated stories across the web . Mr. Skatell experimented with how to promote the page ( including paid ads ) , and it took off , inspiring him to start IJReview as an independent website .Using $ 40,000 he had saved from a game app he made in college and $ 20,000 from his parents , he hired Bert Atkinson , a friend known as Bubba who had been working as a waiter , as editor and chief writer .While the site continued repackaging content from others with eye-catching headlines , Mr. Atkinson and a growing staff began adding their own content too , like amusing explainers of current events . They also began to be fed content by readers . When Mr. Obama told a factory worker at a plant that he had been using Obamacare the wrong way , IJReview received a video of the exchange and posted it .In 2013 , Mr. Skatell joined with Mr. Musser to build a larger company . At the time , IJReview was still receiving fewer than two million unique viewers a month . The men started to focus on audience development .We put more of an emphasis on watching how our audience responded to certain content , tracking real-time analytics much more closely , and lastly reinvesting in growing our distribution channels : Facebook and email lists ,  Mr. Skatell said .A breakthrough insight was figuring out that if they could identify readers who felt strongly about health care and alert them to all their Affordable Care Act articles , there was a higher likelihood they would share them . Putting the right content in front of the right audience became their mantra . Traffic took off . There is an art and science to this ,  Mr. Musser said .IJReviews roughly 30 reporters and editors work from an open-office space in Old Town Alexandria , Va. At a recent news meeting , the young staff members sat on beanbags while brainstorming how to compare the Obama administration to characters in the 1990s sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel Air. ( The idea never panned out . ) The half-dozen reporters at the meeting said they did not do reporting outside the office , although one ventured she would look up something health-related on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website .The IJReviews lighter approach belies the deep political focus in the rest of Mr. Skatells and Mr. Mussers business , Media Group of America . The 62-employee company also runs IMGE , a digital consulting firm for Republican candidates and corporate clients , and IMGE Labs , which builds technical tools like mobile apps for clients , also largely Republican campaigns .Mr. Skatell and Mr. Musser said they plan for the site to widen its reach by becoming a platform for other viewpoints  including Democrats . That could alienate their core readers , but they say they believe that will not happen because of their ability to target specific content to specific readers .For now , their audience reflects the typical conservative base , with an outsize share of readers under 18 and over 45 . A broader base would be good for politics and good for business . This isnt just a Republican primary voter play ,  said Mr. Castellanos , the consultant . It is much bigger and more valuable."
1	"AT the recent New York Times forum in Singapore , Eleonora Sharef , a co-founder of HireArt , was explaining what new skills employers were seeking from job applicants , but she really got the audiences attention when she mentioned that her search firm was recently told by one employer that it wouldnt look at any applicant for a marketing job who didnt have at least 2,000 Twitter followers  and the more the better . She didnt disclose the name of the firm , but she told me that it wasnt Twitter .At a meeting with students at Fudan University in Shanghai a few days earlier , I was struck by how anxious some of the Chinese students were about the question : Am I going to have a job ?  If youre a software engineer in China , youll do fine , also a factory worker  but a plain-old college grad ? The Times reported earlier this year that in China today among people in their early 20s , those with a college degree were four times as likely to be unemployed as those with only an elementary school education.Stories like these explain why I really hope that Obamacare succeeds . Say what ?Heres the logic : The Cold War era I grew up in was a world of insulated walls , both geopolitical and economic , so the pace of change was slower  you could work for the same company for 30 years  and because bosses had fewer alternatives , unions had greater leverage . The result was a middle class built on something called a high-wage or a decent-wage medium-skilled job , and the benefits that went with it .The proliferation of such jobs meant that many people could lead a middle-class lifestyle  with less education and more security  because they didnt have to compete so directly with either a computer or a machine that could do their jobs faster and better ( by far the biggest source of job churn ) or against an Indian or Chinese who would do their jobs cheaper . And by a middle-class lifestyle , I dont mean just scraping by . I mean having status : enough money to buy a house , enjoy some leisure and offer your kids the opportunity to do better than you .But thanks to the merger of globalization and the I.T . revolution that has unfolded over the last two decades  which is rapidly and radically transforming how knowledge and information are generated , disseminated and collaborated on to create value  the high-wage , medium-skilled job is over ,  says Stefanie Sanford , the chief of global policy and advocacy for the College Board . The only high-wage jobs that will support the kind of middle-class lifestyle of old will be high-skilled ones , requiring a commitment to rigorous education , adaptability and innovation , she added .But will even this prescription for creating enough jobs with decent middle-class incomes suffice , asks James Manyika , who leads research on economic and technology trends at the McKinsey Global Institute . While these prescriptions are certainly correct ,  notes Manyika , they may not be enough to solve for the scale and nature of the problem. The pace of technologically driven productivity growth , he said , suggests that we may not need as many workers to drive equivalent levels of output and G.D.P .As the M.I.T . economists Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee show in their book Race Against the Machine ,  for the last two centuries productivity , median income and employment all rose together . No longer . Now we have record productivity , wealth and innovation , yet median incomes are falling , inequality is rising and high unemployment remains persistent .To be sure , notes Manyika , a similar thing happened when we introduced technology to agriculture . We did not need as many people to produce food , so everybody shifted to manufacturing . As the same thing happened there , many people shifted to services .But now , adds Manyika , a growing share of high-paying services and knowledge work is also falling prey to technology. And while new companies like Twitter are exciting , they do not employ people with high-paying jobs in large numbers . The economy and the service sector will still offer large numbers of jobs , but many simply may not sustain a true middle-class lifestyle .As a result , argues Manyika , how we think about employment to sustain a middle-class lifestyle may need to expand to include a broader set of possibilities for generating income compared with the traditional job , with benefits and a well-grooved career path . To be in the middle class , you may need to consider not only high-skilled jobs , but also more nontraditional forms of work ,  explained Manyika . Work itself may have to be thought of as a form of entrepreneurship where you draw on all kinds of assets and skills to generate income .This could mean leveraging your skills through Task Rabbit , or your car through Uber , or your spare bedroom through AirBnB to add up to a middle-class income.In the end , this transition were going through could prove more exciting than people think , but right now asking large numbers of people to go from being an employee to a work entrepreneur feels scary and uncertain . Having a national health care safety net under the vast majority of Americans  to ease and enable people to make this transition  is both morally right and in the interest of everyone who wants a stable society ."
1	"ATLANTA  Georgia Senate candidate Michelle Nunn is refusing to say whether she would have voted for President Barack Obama 's signature health care law in a race that could help determine congressional control .In a recent NBC News interview , Nunn said , `` it 's impossible to look back retrospectively and say , 'What would you have done if you were there ? ' ''Nunn has been critical of some aspects of the law , and praised other elements . She said `` Obamacare '' should not be repealed . A recent poll found most Georgians think the law needs major changes or should be repealed .Republicans must gain six seats to win the majority and have tried to make the midterm elections a referendum on `` Obamacare . ''Nunn is poised to capture the Democratic nomination for the open seat on Tuesday ."
1	"ATLANTA  In the South , where a Republican sweep of Senate races would all but guarantee a GOP takeover of the chamber , Democrats are pinning their hopes on two coastal states whose economic and population growth have often outpaced their neighbors ' .North Carolina remains the Democrats ' best bet for holding a hard-fought seat . And they see a long-shot chance to win Georgia 's GOP-held seat growing slightly brighter .But the Democrats ' prospects seem grimmer in other Southern states .They have virtually given up on ousting five-term Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell in Kentucky . And in Louisiana and Arkansas , veteran Democratic senators are struggling against challengers who relentlessly link them to an unpopular president , Barack Obama .With Election Day less than three weeks away , all these races are being stirred by debates , spending shifts and visits by famous politicians .In North Carolina , where Republicans are pouring millions of new dollars into trying to oust Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan , she spent Wednesday hitting GOP challenger Thom Tillis on women 's health issues .In Kentucky , Hillary Rodham Clinton 's visit the same day came at an awkward moment . The Democrats ' top Senate campaign group signaled Tuesday it would buy no more ads for Alison Lundergan Grimes ' bid to defeat McConnell .The most obvious difference in these races is the level of voter antagonism toward Obama . He lost North Carolina by only 2 percentage points in 2012 ( after winning it in 2008 ) , and he lost Georgia by 7 points .But Obama lost Arkansas , Louisiana and Kentucky by far greater margins . Republicans in these states want to drive out the last of their statewide elected Democrats , much as Alabama and Mississippi did several years ago .The South 's political realignment  from conservative Democratic stronghold in the 1960s to `` sunbelt '' Republican ascendancy in the 1980s and 1990s  continues to evolve . Job growth in and around Atlanta and Charlotte and Raleigh-Durham , North Carolina , is helping Democrats compete in those regions , even as rural areas turn strongly against them .`` The East Coast South is diversifying economically and demographically much more than the inner South , '' said Ferrel Guillory , who tracks regional politics and trends from the University of North Carolina . Economically robust areas of Virginia , North Carolina and Georgia have seen a greater influx of jobs , Northerners and Midwesterners than have their Deep South neighbors to the west , he said .Similar migration helped build Republican suburbs in the 1980s , Guillory said , but `` now the growth is helping fuel Democrats , '' especially as significant numbers of blacks return to these states .This year 's Senate races in Kentucky and Georgia illustrate the trend . A year ago , Democrats held roughly equal hopes that one of the states would produce a net Senate gain . McConnell has never been deeply popular in Kentucky , they noted , and Georgia 's seat was open thanks to GOP Sen. Saxby Chambliss ' retirement .But McConnell and his allies spent millions of dollars denouncing Grimes and Obama , and Grimes faltered recently when she repeatedly refused to say whether she had voted for the president .In Georgia , both parties turned to non-Washington candidates . Democrats chose Michelle Nunn , daughter of former Sen. Sam Nunn , while business executive David Perdue survived a crowded Republican primary .Georgia still tilts Republican , but Democrats are pounding Perdue for sending jobs overseas while heading large companies . They hope a libertarian candidate might force a Nunn-Perdue runoff in January , which would allow the attacks to continue .Developments in key races:LOUISIANA and ARKANSASRepublicans used televised debates to tie Democratic Sens . Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Mark Pryor of Arkansas as tightly to Obama as possible .Arkansas Republican Rep. Tom Cotton used the term `` Obama '' or `` Obamacare '' nine times in his two-minute opening statement , 13 times in his two-minute closing , and nearly 50 times in between during a debate Monday .`` Clearly , Congressman Cotton is running against one man , '' Pryor said . `` But I am running for 3 million Arkansans . ''Cassidy used the same anti-Obama tactic in a debate with Landrieu .NORTH CAROLINADemocrats note that requests for mail-in absentee ballots seem to favor them thus far , a possible sign of pro-Hagan enthusiasm . Republicans call the statistics insignificant , and say their targeted mail efforts will offset any Democratic edge .In a state already saturated with political TV ads , the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is launching a new round , featuring Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky praising Tillis .GEORGIAThe Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee launched a $ 1 million TV ad buy that criticizes Perdue 's comments on education . It 's the committee 's first direct spending for Nunn , who had hoped for more . In an accidentally leaked strategy memo , Nunn 's consultants originally estimated an $ 8 million investment by the DSCC .Still , her campaign claims momentum after a 2005 court deposition surfaced in which Perdue , the former CEO of Dollar General and Reebok , spoke about spending `` most of my career '' on outsourcing .KENTUCKYClinton , the former secretary of state and possible 2016 presidential candidate , campaigned for Grimes in Louisville on Wednesday , one day after the DSCC stopped running TV ads in the race .Grimes ' supporters noted that she raised $ 4.9 million in the most recent quarter , leaving her more than $ 4 million to spend in the final three weeks .`` If Democrats are going to win this time , it 's going to be won on the ground , '' said Will Carle , a Democratic political consultant in Kentucky .___Babington reported from Washington . Associated Press writers Bill Barrow in Atlanta , Adam Beam in Frankfort , Kentucky , Donna Cassata in New Orleans , and Gary Robertson in Raleigh , North Carolina , contributed to this report ."
1	"Aaron Carroll talks about the Republican health care dilemma , and makes a good point : it runs deeper than the specific fact that Obamacare looks the way it does because it has to . At the most fundamental level , you cant guarantee adequate health care to everyone unless the people who dont need help right now  the young , healthy , and affluent  are induced , one way or another , to contribute to the care of those who do need help . You can do this purely with taxes , via a single-payer system ( and maybe even by having the government act as provider ) , or you can do it , Swiss or Massachusetts style , via a combination of regulation , taxes , and subsidies . But some way of corralling the lucky healthy into contributing is necessary .For the vast majority of this group , this is still a good deal  as Ezra Klein says , nobody stays young and healthy forever , and only a very small number of people are so rich that they are better off on a lifetime basis with no guarantee of insurance at all . But conservatives balk at the notion of any kind of redistribution , even if it makes almost everyone better off . So they are unable to come up with an alternative .What they have are fantasies  claims that somehow unleashing the magic of the marketplace can make health care so cheap that everyone can afford it . There is absolutely no reason to believe that this is true .And this also means that their only chance of defeating Obamacare was to stop it before it went into effect . Once its in place , most people will see real benefits  and Republicans will have nothing to offer instead ."

1	"After two years , ObamaCare is an epithet no more . The Obama campaign says so .On Friday , the second anniversary of the day President Obama signed the law expanding health insurance  and two days before the Supreme Court opens arguments on its constitutionality  his re-election campaign has embraced the term that Republicans have long used to deride the measure .The law is the presidents signature domestic achievement , but still a widely unpopular one  thanks in part to the sustained Republican assault that Democrats never countered in kind  at least until now .Jim Messina , the Obama campaign manager , wrote in a fundraising e-mail : Its about time we give it the love it deserves . Let everyone know : I like ObamaCare.With such prodding , supporters wrote endorsements on Facebook and on their Twitter accounts , making  # ILikeObamaCare a trending topic on Twitter .Jennifer OMalley Dillon , the deputy campaign manager , sent out her own tweets and re-tweeted others , including this one : Happy birthday to ObamaCare : two years in , the Affordable Care Act is making millions of Americans lives better every day.In the past , Mr. Obama , at occasional party fund-raisers , has said he does not mind that Republicans have called the law ObamaCare ,  saying they are right : Obama cares. But while the White House and his campaign had never done much to push back against use of the word  perhaps hoping for the day that they would want to own it  they had not until now taken ownership .The move to do so on Friday countered Republicans own campaign on the laws second anniversary , taunting the White House for not doing anything special to observe the day .Today is the 2nd anniversary of ObamaCare , a milestone the president is not celebrating . Why ? He doesnt want to defend it ,  Sean Spicer , the communications director of the Republican National Committee , wrote in an e-mail he circulated widely ."
1	"After yesterdays detour into electoral politics , lets turn back to the health care debate . Last week , amid the ongoing coverage of rising premiums and cancelled plans , the health care laws defenders took a new tack , arguing that the most plausible conservative alternatives to Obamacare would involve even more disruption of existing arrangements  with the implication being , then , that Republican outrage over rate shock is either straightforwardly cynical or else a sign that the G.O.P . would never , ever be willing to embrace a reform that disrupts the status quo at all .This argument has some merit , for the reasons Philip Klein elaborated on here : You cant have health care reform without some kind of insurance disruption , and a Republican would-be reformer who made an Obama-esque keep your plan promise would either be exposed as a liar with similar alacrity or end up never actually undertaking reform at all . ( This is yet another reason why a total death-spiraling exchange failure , coupled with a relative successful Medicaid rollout , would not necessarily leave conservative reformers in an ideal political spot . )But I also think its useful to think about the differences between the kind of disruption that would accompany the most plausible conservative alternative to Obamacare and what were actually witnessing today , because it helps clarify whether the Affordable Care Act actually represents what Jonathan Chait , speaking for the defense , calls the least-disruptive , least-painful way to expand insurance coverage .The conservative alternative I have in mind is not what you might call the full McCain  the conversion of the existing employer tax exclusion for health insurance into a universal credit , which is an elegant idea in conception but which would indeed disrupt existing arrangements more dramatically than the Affordable Care Act , and which ( on the evidence of the 2008 campaign ) is about as politically sale-able as single payer . Rather , its the more modest plan the American Enterprise Institutes James Capretta has done the most work fleshing out , in which a cap on the employer deduction helps pay for a flat credit available only to those Americans who dont receive coverage through their workplace .Liberals object to this plan for a variety of reasons : The credit would fund catastrophic coverage rather than the comprehensive insurance they prefer , and it would require expanding high-risk pools to cover current uninsurables rather than folding them into the existing insurance system . But on the specific question of existing-plan disruption  who bears the burden of reform , and why  I think the Capretta plan has advantages over Obamacare that even liberals should be able to recognize .Thats because the way our system is set up right now , anyone who buys insurance on the individual market has been persistently disadvantaged , and often dramatically so , relative to anyone who gets insurance through their employer , because employer-provided insurance comes with an effective government subsidy ( worth more than $ 5,000 on a $ 13,000 employer-sponsored plan for an upper middle class family , Capretta points out ) while the individual marketplace does not . So a cap on the employer tax exclusion , while disruptive , would make the system fairer in clear , uncomplicated ways : It would curb a tax subsidy that mostly benefits people with higher incomes and only benefits people with expensive insurance plans , and extend that subsidy to people who have had to pay more , often much more , for insurance up until now .By contrast , the Obamacare approach loads much more of the financial burden of reform on to the individual market , creating a stark , even chasm-like divide between that markets winners and losers and leaving the latter doubly-shafted : They still dont get a tax subsidy and their plans are getting a lot more expensive into the bargain .Some of these losers are well-off , yes . But many of them are middle class , and not necessarily better off than the people who would lose out under an employer-exclusion cap . Moreover , theres a significant difference between what such a cap would actually do to people with employer-provided insurance and what Obamacare does to people with less-expensive individual market plans . The cap would basically give employers and employees a choice : Keep the expensive plans you currently have with higher premiums and co-pays attached ( or with a higher tax bill at the end of the year ) , or shift down to plans with higher deductibles , network limitations , and so forth . This is not an easy choice by any means , and it would undoubtedly lead to the equivalent of some of the unhappy stories associated with Obamacares regulations  people who feel like they can no longer afford coverage they like , people who end up losing access to their doctors and hospitals because their employer stops offering a plan , and so on . But I would submit that its actually more humane to expose the already-subsidized to more of the real costs associated with their expensive insurance than it is to tell the persistently-unsubsidized that their most affordable insurance options are being outlawed , and that they are now required by law to pay more for more coverage ( or , as often seems to be the case , to pay more for less ) .Whats more , as Reihan Salam points out in an exchange with Salons Brian Beutler , this isnt an either-or choice , because Obamacare too includes a kludge-y version of the employer tax deduction cap in the form of the excise ( or Cadillac ) tax on high-cost insurance plans : Its just set a higher threshold and thus applies to fewer policies than would the conservative alternative . That tax isnt scheduled to be implemented till 2018 ( or year two of the Christie administration , if you prefer ) , so its effects arent being fully felt as yet  but as the date gets closer , that provision will lead to rate increases and policy changes at the more expensive end of the employer market as well . So in comparing the potential disruptive effect of Caprettas cap-and-credit approach to the Affordable Care Act , you have to look at the complete picture : What were seeing from Obamacare right now is only the beginning of the disruptions to existing plans , and todays individual market losers are only the first wave of people to whom the presidents keep your plan promise doesnt actually apply .The choice , then , isnt between gouging a few million people in the individual market or gouging a much larger number in the employer-based market . Its between a reform ( the conservative alternative ) that concentrates its disruptive impact the heretofore-oversubsidized portion of the marketplace , while trying to make the individual market more affordable for everyone who buys there , or a reform ( Obamacare ) thats disruptive for some people in the employer market but continues to protect most of them from the true price of their insurance , while pushing more of the off-budget cost of reform on to individual market premiums .There are enough moving parts and unknown unknowns in each alternative that its hard to say for sure which would one would ultimately be more disruptive in absolute terms ( or even to define what those absolute terms would be ) . But I think there are various metrics  simplicity , equity , the choices left available and the incentives created  on which the conservative option might come out ahead ."
1	"Amid this weeks hints that the federal exchange still wont be anywhere close to functional on December 1st , Matt Yglesias offers the latest noble attempt to explain to Americans losing their individual-market coverage why theyre actually better off paying higher premiums for new , Obamacare-era plans . Instead of focusing on the more comprehensive benefits that the new plans offer , he takes a different tack  suggesting that most people with cheapish individual-market coverage didnt really have insurance at all: The ACA cracks down on insurance rescission . It was famously difficult on the old market for people with pre-existing conditions to get coverage . Thats because insurance companies dont want to cover people who are actually sick . Even healthy people generally want health insurance coverage because they might get sick . But an insurance company has no desire to actually foot the bill for a seriously ill persons medical treatment . Hence , in the individual market the standard practice was to earn a profit selling peace of mind to healthy people , only to pivot as quickly as possible toward cancellation of the plan as soon as major bills started coming in . The ACA , rightly , puts a stop to this scam .Since insurance companies now wont be allowed to collect premiums while youre healthy only to yank coverage when you get sick , they have no choice but to pre-emptively cancel plans that wouldnt be financially beneficial to actually pay out .Thats the story of Obamacare victims such as Lee Hammack and JoEllen Brothers , loyal Democrats aged 60 and 59 who enjoyed miraculously low premiums until the ACA ruined the party . Hammack and Brothers are certainly entitled to feel miffed about losing their apparently sweet deal . But they ought to reflect on the overwhelming likelihood that their pre-ACA circumstances were a happy illusion . They were both , by their own admission , quite healthy and thus profitable to insure . Had one of them actually fallen ill , the plan would have become a loss center for the insurer and canceled as swiftly as a pretext could be found . Its being canceled now because under the new rules its now or never for the insurer . Charging premiums only to yank the policy retroactively is no longer on the table .While rescission is a real phenomenon in the individual market , and ( for obvious reasons ) a controversial , lawsuit-generating one , I dont see Yglesias citing any evidence to back up his claim that it was anything like the standard practice for insurers pre-Obamacare , or that most peoples coverage was therefore illusory and subject to all-but-inevitable retroactive cancellation . And those contention seem dubious at best . During the original Obamacare debate , for instance , the conservative economist John Goodman cited data suggesting that rescission is actually vanishingly rare , and noted that the White House accused insurers of systematically rescinding coverage for women with breast cancer based on just four cases out of thousands . Likewise , the University of Pennsylvanias Mark Pauly has done a fair amount of research on individual insurance market outcomes , concluding that although there have been some anecdotes about insurers slipping out of their policy provision to renew coverage at group average premiums for high risks by canceling the coverage entirely , we conclude that on average guaranteed renewability works in practice as it should in theory and provides a substantial amount of protection against high premiums to those high risk individuals who bought insurance before their risk levels changed. ( In this paper from 2008 , he and a co-author found that while the employer coverage was more stable than individual-market coverage for Americans with average health , for people in fair or poor health the chances of losing coverage are actually lower in the individual market than in the employer-based market . )Maybe these analyses are mistaken , and there are detailed dives into the data that confirm Yglesiass argument . But it seems like Goodmans 2010 point is well taken : If rescission were the rule rather than a rare exception , its hard to imagine that much of an individual market would actually exist , let alone serve millions of consumers . You dont need to have faith in the kindness of insurers ( I certainly dont ) to recognize that in the aggregate , companies that dont deliver what their products promise ( and what the law and state regulators require of them ) tend to run into problems pretty quickly . And so the exceptions notwithstanding , it seems quite likely that the plan Lee Hammack and JoEllen Brothers paid for  and many other pre-Obamacare plans like them  would have actually paid out ."
1	"Among the many vituperative reactions I had to yesterdays column , one recurred a lot  namely , the assertion that Californias rising enrollment in Obamacare would bankrupt the state , which is already a fiscal basket case .Guys , you do need to keep up a bit .First of all , the Obamacare subsidies  both the credits for insurance purchased on the exchanges and the Medicaid expansion  are paid for by the federal government . In fact , implementing Obamacare is a major fiscal and economic boost to any state that does it , and states opting out of the Medicaid expansion are going to have significantly lower overall incomes and fewer jobs than if they had gone along . ( My back of the envelope says around 1 percent of GDP , but Im still working on that . )Beyond that , however , the California as fiscal basket case narrative is way , way out of date . Jerry Brown and the huge Democratic majority in the legislature have turned that situation completely around .I know , its not supposed to be that way  and a lot of people will stick to their narrative , never mind the facts . But anyway , California is doing OK , both on health care and on budget policy ."
1	"An editor with multiple graduate degrees once called me up with a story idea hatched among fellow trend-sniffers in Manhattan . Indians ,  he said , with practiced urgency . Somethings going on with American Indians . Look into it and tell me what you think.Dutifully , I reported back that the first Americans were still poor , still forgotten , still there  albeit with casinos and better lobbyists in Washington . The forgotten part applies especially at elections , given that natives who list themselves as Indian alone on the census form make up less than 1 percent of the total population of the United States .But  news alert !  with barely two weeks to go until the midterm federal election , the most underrepresented people in the country could be the kingmakers for control of the Senate . Let us pause for the cynical voice of an Indian friend who thinks that elections dont matter : Democrats , Republicans , theyre all white to me ,  he says .Still , the fact that all the money and manipulations of the Koch brothers could be undone by a handful of native voters living in some of the poorest and most remote parts of the land is a tribute to our teetering democracy . More time has been wasted defending the name of the Washington Professional Football Team than has ever been spent discussing tribal sovereignty or how the modern diet is killing too many natives . Yet now , important-sounding people have been forced to learn a phrase in Yupik , or find Shannon County , S.D. , on a map .The Senate , by design , is unrepresentative . Why should Wyoming have as many senators as California , which has more than 60 times the population ? That design also means that people in crowded states occasionally have to feign concern for residents in wide-open spaces .Thus we find ourselves in Alaska and South Dakota , where the native vote could be the only thing that stands in the way of a Republican-controlled Senate . Alaska voters , though quirky and contrarian no matter what the race , seem poised to give the Republican Dan Sullivan the seat now held by the Democrat Mark Begich . Except typically , the polls are more misleading in the Last Frontier than a fish finders sonar in a bathtub .Only about 250,000 people are expected to vote there . Of those , almost one in five has some Alaska Native or Indian blood  the highest percentage of any state . Begich has been feverishly working native villages in advance of the states two weeks of early voting . If the race is a nail-biter , look for late returns from , say , Kotzebue , an Inupiat town on a gravel spit 33 miles north of the Arctic Circle , to decide the winner .In South Dakota , Native Americans are the largest single minority group , and they tend to vote Democratic . In a three-way race , heavy turnout on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation might be enough to prevent the fading Republican front-runner , Mike Rounds , from picking up the seat . Tribal elections are the same day , as is a ballot measure to change the name of Shannon County , which is more than 90 percent Indian , to Oglala Lakota County . In 2012 , the tribes of North Dakota provided the winning margin for the Democrat Heidi Heitkamp , who won her Senate seat by just over 4,000 votes .The candidate who learns best how to ask Indians for their votes could be the winner ,  Indian Country Today , the national tribal paper , reported this week in a story on South Dakota .What no vote can change are the woeful conditions in many parts of Indian country . Suicide , substance abuse and chronic unemployment are the scourges of many tribal homelands . Half the people in Shannon County live below the poverty level .Depressing , yes . So what we talk about when we talk about Indians seldom gets beyond caricature . On the left , measures like Seattles new designation of the second Monday in October as Indigenous Peoples Day is the kind of empty , feel-good measure that sets up a comically liberal city council for mockery . Its not a real holiday , just enough of one to insult Italian-Americans who feel slighted at the dis of Christopher Columbus .On the right , there is a hysterical fear of granting Indians any real power . So the Violence Against Women Act almost didnt make it through renewal last year because Republicans didnt want to allow tribes to prosecute non-Indians who assaulted Indians in Indian country .Obamacare is a pundits punching bag in much of the country . But on reservations , it has made a life-or-death difference for thousands of people whose health has been improved by some of the laws lesser-known provisions .At the center of most questions in the native world is a construct that Americans often forget or ignore : nations within a nation . Tribes point to their treaties that grant a degree of sovereignty , signed by long-dead presidents , backed by Supreme Court decisions . If they can get a politician to understand that at election time , its a minor victory ."
1	"And got a great deal .Oh , and enrollment is surging on the state exchanges ."
1	"Andrew Leonard has a good point : if Obamacare is such a disaster for the economy , wheres the market reaction ?More broadly : the perceived probability of passage , as indicated by Intrade , was only around 30 percent a month ago ( which is why Im still rubbing my eyes ) . So the expectations of what were told would be a great disaster have risen dramatically . And the market has yawned ."
1	"Another day , another Romney whopper . Now he says that hell keep the good parts of Obamacare , in particular coverage for people with pre-existing conditions , while scrapping the rest .You cant do that  and Romney knows very well that you cant do that , because the logic that went into Romneycare in Massachusetts is the same as the logic behind Obamacare .Suppose you want to guarantee that insurance is available to people with pre-existing conditions . Well , you can establish community rating , requiring that insurance companies make the same policies available to everyone . But if you stop there , you know what will happen : healthy people will opt out , leaving behind a high-risk , high-cost pool .So you have to also have a mandate , requiring that people buy insurance . And you cant do that without subsidies , so that lower-income people can afford their policies .The inexorable logic of the situation , then , leads to a three-legged stool of community rating + mandate + subsidies = ObamaRomneycare .So , does Romney think were stupid ? Hey , he also thinks well buy into his promises to slash taxes by $ 5 trillion but make up the revenue by closing unspecified loopholes in a way that doesnt raise taxes on the middle class  which turns out to be arithmetically impossible . So the answer is , yes , he thinks were stupid ."
1	"Another die-hard opponent of the Affordable Care Act may be finding a way to expand Medicaid . Few have stood as firm against Obamacare as Gov . Mike Pence of Indiana , but on Thursday he announced a new proposal that would accept federal funds for increased coverage of low-income state residents  though by giving them access to private insurance plans rather than standard Medicaid .Mr. Pence now joins conservative leaders of Arkansas , Michigan , Pennsylvania and Utah who have recently found or are trying to find ways to get to yes with the federal government on this issue . If Mr. Pence can find a way , its likely some of the 23 holdout states will eventually follow .This is significant , because since the Supreme Court made the Medicaid expansion optional for states in 2012 , many states have refused to expand the program . This has left about 5 million people nationwide in a coverage gap , where they are too poor to qualify for exchange subsidies to purchase private insurance , and ineligible for Medicaid as it currently exists . Expanding Medicaid in some way is really the only option for their getting insured , and this proposal gets them much closer to that place .Mr. Pence proposed an expansion of the Healthy Indiana Plan ( HIP ) , a Medicaid alternative that was created in 2007 by a waiver from the Bush administration . It provided coverage to adults in Indiana who earned less than 200 percent of the poverty line . This was important , as parents are eligible for Medicaid only if they earn less than 24 percent of the federal poverty line , or about $ 5,700 for a family of four . Adults without children are not eligible for Medicaid at all .HIP was novel in its reliance on health savings accounts . All participants had to contribute between 2 percent and 5 percent of their income to a special account each month , and the state then topped it up to $ 1,100 each year . This money was used to pay for most nonpreventive health care ; most preventive care was free . If participants exhausted their account , they would be covered by a private health insurance plan .Mr. Pence has long wanted to use HIP as a vehicle to expand coverage for the poor of his state . The federal government has so far refused because it doesnt meet the standard requirements for Medicaid . It has both annual and lifetime limits , meaning that coverage can run out over time . It has no maternity benefits , either , let alone the many preventive care benefits the Affordable Care Act mandates . And , it requires people to put money in the health savings accounts or risk losing coverage .But without an expansion , many in Indiana would be left uninsured this year . More than 800,000 in the state were uninsured before the ACA was rolled out . About 375,000 of them would probably newly qualify for this program .Governor Pences proposal , HIP 2.0 , compromises by creating three options . The first , HIP Link , would provide premium assistance to low-income people who have access to employer-based insurance but can not afford it . Option two , HIP Basic , will be more like HIP , but be available with no contribution to premiums to those earning below the poverty line . HIP Plus will include dental and vision coverage , and it will require monthly contributions between $ 3 and $ 25 , depending on income , to a health savings account .Indiana now needs to allow a period of public hearings in the state . It also needs to get buy-in from local legislators for the plan . But federal approval seems likely . A spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services , Emma Sandoe , said in a statement , We are encouraged by Indiana and Governor Pences commitment to helping cover more of the states uninsured population through the Healthy Indiana program and look forward to seeing his proposal.And the department has already approved plans like Michigans , which is not too different from this one . It also requires beneficiaries who earn between 100 percent and 133 percent of the poverty line to pay 2 percent of their income to a health savings account and limits cost-sharing to no more than 5 percent of income .Mr. Pence hopes to submit his proposal by the end of June . If approved , many uninsured people in Indiana would see their prospects improve if they became eligible for insurance . Hospitals and providers would probably see their numbers of Medicaid covered patients go up and uninsured patients go down . Indianas state government would get to hold true to its belief that private insurance and health savings accounts are the best way to expand coverage . Finally , the Obama administration would get to achieve its goal of fully activating the ACA in another state .The one caveat here is that its possible that expansion of insurance through HIP could be more expensive than expansion through traditional Medicaid , perhaps more than 40 percent more , according to past reports from the states own actuary . Its unclear whether thats still the case . Either way , it seems that all involved may be willing to pay that price to move forward ."
1	"Anthony D. Weiners advocacy for Obamacare was well known to anyone watching cable news when the House of Representatives passed the legislation in 2009 . But did he really coin the term ?He said so in an interview with The New York Times recently , which quoted him saying it , near the bottom of a front-page article on Thursday about Mr. Weiners record in Congress .Published , the claim prompted a round of invented-the-Internet-style mockery at Mr. Weiners expense on Thursday . After all , the term Obamacare had circulated for some time  Mitt Romney used it in a presidential debate as early as 2007  and Mr. Weiner did not become outspoken on the issue , let alone embrace the term , until much later .Well , no one said you get elected mayor on modesty ,  Edward-Isaac Dovere of Politico wrote on Twitter . Emalie Clamage , a blogger , joked that Mr. Weiners father was the inventor of Toaster Strudel.But Barbara Morgan , a spokeswoman for Mr. Weiner , who is running for mayor of New York City , insisted on Thursday that he did not mean that he was the first person ever to use the term  only the first on the left to embrace it unapologetically .Up till then , the right had used the term as a pejorative ,  she said . He realized that running from the term was a mistake , and eventually so did the White House and the Obama campaign.In the interview with The Times , which was recorded , Mr. Weiner was defending his work on behalf of the health legislation when he brought up the term Obamacare .He added , in an aside , that it was a term , by the way , that I coined and used proudly , long before the administration decided it was a good idea . And I got yelled at by the White House for using it , and then they eventually reached the place where they used it."
1	"Are you one of the 46 million Americans without health insurance ? Well , you may not have that , uh , luxury for much longer . A federal judge in Michigan on Thursday dismissed one of more than 15 legal challenges to the new health care law , becoming the first to rule that the law is constitutional ,  reports The Timess Kevin Sack . The central question , which may ultimately fall to the Supreme Court , is whether the Commerce Clause of the Constitution gives Congress the authority to require citizens to obtain a commercial product , namely health insurance . Starting in 2014 , the law will require most Americans to obtain health insurance Judge George Steehs ruling centers on the idea that health care is distinct from other products in such a way that the act of not purchasing it constitutes involvement in interstate commerce . ( Ive tried to make a similar argument to my wife about N.F.L . Sunday Ticket , but shes apparently from the strict constructionist school . ) Heres key section of the decision:The health care market is unlike other markets . No one can guarantee his or her health , or ensure that he or she will never participate in the health care market . Indeed , the opposite is nearly always true . The question is how participants in the health care market pay for medical expenses  through insurance , or through an attempt to pay out of pocket with a backstop of uncompensated care funded by third parties . This phenomenon of costshifting is what makes the health care market unique . Far from inactivity ,  by choosing to forgo insurance plaintiffs are making an economic decision to try to pay for health care services later , out of pocket , rather than now through the purchase of insurance , collectively shifting billions of dollars , $ 43 billion in 2008 , onto other market participants .The future of health care reform just became a little more secure ,  writes a thankful Jonathan Cohn at The New Republic:The premise of Steehs legal argument seems to be a notion about policythat its not possible to regulate the insurance industry , in a way that would make coverage available to all people , without compelling every person to get coverage . On that count , I would argue , Steeh is correct .So what does this mean for the repeal movement ? My limited understanding , informed by a few casual conversations with some law professors , is that Steehs decision is consistent with the traditional understanding of the Commerce Clausethat the only way to throw out the mandate would be to reexamine conventional assumptions about the Commerce Clause . That would be a fairly radical move . But Steeh is a Clinton appointee . As those other suits go forward in other states , culminating perhaps in a Supreme Court case , were going to hear from some judges who are more conservativein some cases , a lot more conservative . Radical reinterpretation of the Commerce Clause may be something theyre willing to try .Allahpundit at Hot Air thinks the judge was following precedent from on high : This really is well in line with the Supreme Courts ridiculously expansive Commerce Clause jurisprudence . You cant opt out of interstate marijuana commerce by growing and using your own at home , so why should you be able to opt out of interstate health insurance commerce when youre bound to use medical facilities somewhere at some point ? Still , Allahpundit thinks the judge has covered some new , and shaky , ground:What hes saying here , basically , is that were all either already or potentially engaged in health-care commerce because none of us will fail to seek essential medical services if theyre required and none of us will be denied essential services if we cant pay . The supermarket will turn away a starving man if he has no money ; not so the ER and people who are sick , so for all intents and purposes , weve all already opted in here . That being so , the feds can regulate how those services are paid for If were all necessarily active in health-care commerce at all times , theoretically theres no limit to what sort of further activity can be mandated in the interest of spreading costs . Can the overweight man or woman be forced to diet because he/she is more likely to need medical services ? Presumably that would be dealt with via higher insurance premiums , but we all know only too well already that federal pressure on insurers to keep premiums down will create all sorts of inefficiencies , which is where we get into ye olde rationing problem . Simple question : Whats the limiting principle on this decision ? Would the feds be barred from penalizing people for failing to maintain , say , a certain BMI target because of the right of privacy or bodily autonomy , etc ? Or would they not be barred at all ? Where does this end ?I actually wish the purchase of health insurance was interstate commerce ,  adds New Jersey blogger Chris Wysocki . True interstate commerce , as in I can buy health insurance from a company that is in another state . Like New York , where the RPI alumni association offers a Blue Cross plan which is 35 % cheaper than the  Aetna plan Im forced to buy here in New Jersey . Oh sure , Blue Cross has a New Jersey plan , its even more expensive than Aetna . But right over the border theres that tantalizing New York plan , taunting me with its lower premiums and better benefits . True interstate commerce would mean that I could buy it.Ilya Somin at the Volokh Conspiracy thinks that Judge Steeh has a skewed view of how the health market works:The problem with this reasoning is that those who choose not to buy health insurance arent necessarily therefore going to buy the same services in other ways later . Some will , but some wont . It depends on whether or not they get sick , how severe ( and how treatable their illnesses are ) , whether if they do get sick , they can get assistance from charity , and many other factors . In addition , some people might be able to maintain their health simply by buying services that arent usually covered by insurance anyway , such as numerous low-cost medicines available in drug stores and the like . In such cases , they arent really participating in the same market as insurance purchasers .Jay Stevens at Left in the West isnt buying Somins point . For starters , unless non-insurance-buyers are some kind of genetic Supermenschen , they , as a group , will experience sudden and catastrophic injury or illness at the same rate that insurance buyers do  at best ,  he writes . Of course , thats only considering the statistical case . In reality , the uninsured are much more likely to rack up higher long-term medical costs because they are much less likely to seek out preventative or early medical care . But , more simply , everyone gets sick and dies eventually . No one maintains their health. Healthcare is inevitable for all  So , under the commerce clause of the Constitution and Congress power to tax and spend providing for the general welfare ,  the bill is legal.Another careful reader of Somins post was Randy Barnett , also at the Volokh blog : I agree with [ Somin 's ] assessment of the opinion , with one exception . I do not believe Judge Steeh relied upon existing Supreme Court doctrine because of his claim that this was a case of first impression and therefore not covered by that doctrine . This presents a new debate : Has the Supreme Court covered the field with its current Commerce and Necessary & Proper Clause analysis , in which case lower courts are bound to hold the Act is unconstitutional because it extends beyond this doctrine ? Or does the unprecedented nature of the individual mandate render this a case of first impression requiring new doctrine that lower courts are free to invent ? That argument may be a bit heady for us lay readers , but Barnetts more general comments are crystal clear , if somewhat dystopian:Never before in American history has the U.S. Government imposed an economic mandate commanding that persons engage in economic activity  Judge Steeh accepted the governments expansion of Congressional power beyond regulating economic activity to regulating economic decisions  By inventing a new economic decisions doctrine , Judge Steeh has gone beyond the Commerce and Necessary and Proper Clause doctrines established by the Supreme Court . Only the Supreme Court is authorized to expand its own interpretation of the scope of Congressional power .Of course , judges in other challenges will have their opportunity to opine on whether Congress has the power to regulate any economic decision that may substantially affect interstate commerce . The economic decision not to buy a car , the economic decision not to buy or sell your home , or even the economic decision not to have a physical exam . For make no mistake . If the Supreme Court ever accepts the governments economic decision theory , then there is nothing it can not mandate in the future in the name of regulating commerce . . . among the several states. Congress will then have the general police power that both the Constitution and the Supreme Court has always denied it .Same blog , yet another view : Randy states that Judge Steeh claimed that this was a case of first impression and therefore not covered by Supreme Court doctrine ,  argues Orin Kerr at Volokh . But I dont think thats what Judge Steeh said Judge Steehs opinion seems to me to be relying on existing Supreme Court doctrine . Now , of course you could argue that its relying incorrectly on that precedent . But it seems to me that the opinion on its terms is applying Supreme Court precedent , not inventing a new doctrine.In any case , Kerr thinks that , legally , this is all moot:In my view , what district courts do with the individual mandate is essentially irrelevant for all but political purposes . The issue in this case is legal , not factual , and an appeal is guaranteed . This means all of the district court decisions are just for show , and the real issue is whether any circuit court panels will get a majority to vote against the mandate , survive en banc challenge , and therefore create a split that prompts Supreme Court review . I personally doubt they will , and I would guess that the Supreme Court wont review the issue without a split . If the Supreme Court does take the case it seems like a likely 81 to me , with Justice Thomas dissenting On the political side , incidentally , I think its quite different . In the political realm , district court decisions on the mandate are hugely important . A district court decision striking down the mandate would give added fuel to GOP efforts to repeal the mandate after the mid-term election if Republicans take over the House and ( maybe ) Senate . All the more true if the opinion includes lots of majestic prose about overreaching government .Repeal ? Washington Monthlys Steve Benen isnt worried:No matter what happens in the midterm elections , opponents of the Affordable Care Act will struggle to repeal the law through legislative means . Theyre better off , at least marginally , taking their case to the courts , where there are currently over a dozen challenges to various provisions of the health care law , most notably the individual mandate  There are , however , plenty of rulings yet to come , and yesterdays decision will be appealed to the 6th Circuit , which is one of the nations most conservative and might be inclined to make a fairly radical move. Still , yesterday was a heartening win , and will likely be the first of many .Tom Maguire at JustOneMinute thinks this goes well beyond health care , and gets to the center of President Obamas hopes and dreams:The ER is legally proscribed from turning people away , which reflects the values of our society . However , that sense of compassion has apparently morphed into compulsion  since we wont let people bleed out on the steps of the hospital , a judge has concluded that we can require them to buy insurance . That is an interesting shift in favor of Obamas view of himself as his brothers keeper , with the constitutional right to impose his keeper-dom whether his brother wants it or not . My sense of individual freedom and responsibility has now been trumped by Obamas determination to help me whether I want his help or not . I can see the new license plates already  Live Free My Way Or Die .Maguire gets support , of a sort , from Scott Lemieux of Lawyers , Guns and Money : Part of me wishes that Maguires position ( although I believe it is very wrong as a matter of constitutional law ) would prevail , because holding the mandate unconstitutional would ( given the other plainly constitutional and very popular provisions requiring that insurers not deny insurance based on pre-existing conditions ) destroy the private insurance markets , which would just lead to the state-run insurance that has proven in many other countries to provide better results for less money . Which , again , would be clearly constitutional unless you want to argue that Medicare , Social Security , etc . are also unconstitutional . So , hey , good luck libertarian litigators ! So theres your contrarian thought for the day : if you kill Obamacare , you will only make it stronger ."
1	"As Greg Sargent has been pointing out for some time , the startup troubles of Obamacare have divided both the general public and the political class into two different intellectual universes . On one side , Republicans  both the base and the political leadership  have decided that health reform is already a failure ; that conviction is actually helping the leadership rein in some of the crazies , by telling them that now is the time to wait and let the political payoff from Obamacares collapse fall into their laps .On the other side , Democrats see a law that got off to a terrible start but is getting rapidly better .Which is right ? Theres data showing a sharp rise in enrollments , but there are continuing problems with the back end , and then there are dueling anecdotes . It would be hard to assess all this objectively even if political passions werent running so high .But one group has a strong incentive to be objective  and also has a much better perspective on whats really going on than any lay observer . Namely , the insurance industry . So the shoe weve all been waiting to see drop  or not  was the surge of advertising urging people buying insurance through the exchanges to buy from me , me , me .That shoe has just dropped , with $ 500 million of advertising spending now in the pipeline . Insurers think this is going to work .Now , some people will see this as bad news . Obamacare is just going to add to insurer profits ! And it will indeed make money for the likes of Aetna and Wellpoint . In an ideal world , this wouldnt be happening : single payer would clearly have been a better system . But it wasnt going to happen . This was the health reform we could get  and when it works , as the big money now believes it will , its going to make a huge , positive difference to millions of lives ."
1	"As Republican control and racially polarized politics have grown in the American South during the Obama presidency , so has the willingness of many Southerners to speak frankly about racial divisions in their comments to the Times .The latest window opened on these voices of the South in response to Charles Blows Thursday column , The Solid South Will Rise Again.The Democrats wrote off the region long ago , and working class whites knew it ,  Lars in Winder , Ga. , wrote . Both whites and blacks in the South desperately need economic solutions to their problems ; so far I havent heard many.In numerous states , Republicans control every congressional district with a white majority population , and the seats in the United States Senate as well , Mr. Blow wrote .This region has become so solidly Republican , particularly since President Obama was elected , that there isnt much left there for the Democratic Party to defend or salvage ,  Mr. Blow wrote .Midterm election results in Louisiana are stark illustration . Senator Mary Landrieu , a Louisiana Democrat who faces a runoff election in December , won just 18 percent support from white voters earlier this month , but 94 percent from black voters , Mr. Blow noted .That racial dichotomy points to the inseparable nature of ideology and race in the South , Mr. Blow said . And readers from the region agreed , throwing in a mascot to round out the picture .A strange combination of conservative politics and Christian religion has become a regional white identity ( along with being fans of the LSU Tigers ) ,  wrote a person from Louisiana . Republicans have managed to integrate their ideas into the very character of white Southerners.Some readers explained they feel more alienated from Democrats than from Republicans , who also repel them .As a white Southerner I cant help but feel that the Democratic Party hates me and views my values with contempt ,  Jim C. wrote from Georgia . We vote Republican because they are the lesser evil , not because we want to be exploited by that pack of ignorant reactionaries.Republican campaigns playing on peoples fears stoke the disaffection , even as average voters suffer , some readers explained , using recent electioneering as example .In campaigns for re-election the G.O.P . mentions Obamas name , Obamacare , ISIL , Ebola and illegal immigration as if they are the root of all the problems we face ,  LVG wrote from Atlanta . Yet Georgia has the highest unemployment in the country . These folks get re-elected despite their failure to govern.Mr. Blow wrote , This regional hyper-racialization of our politics has many origins , some historical and some current , but it does not bode well for the future of the country as a whole.Some readers responded angrily , saying black voters strong affiliation with the Democratic Party and ethnic divisions in Northern cities are equivalent characteristics to the increasing Republican majority in the South .Just because your values and party affiliation is one or the other doesnt mean based on your choice of where you live means you are bigoted , ignorant or racists !  Macman007 wrote from Alabama . Better try and find a new boogeyman.Others said politics in the South will always have racial characteristics .As long as Democrats are perceived to be the party of black Americans , they will not make inroads until the deep-seated antipathy of whites toward blacks here ceases ,  wrote Joseph in Phenix City , Ala. I dont have any hopes it will be soon.The undeniable polarization is harmful to the country , Mr. Blow wrote . We are self-sorting ourselves into hardened , impenetrable citadels of ideological sameness that harks back to the nations darker days ,  he wrote .Believing in a racially reconciled America is just progressive vanity , some Southerners said .The midterm elections have left us with the America that always has been ,  Ken H. wrote from Athens , Ala. It is tainted with more racial , gender , ethnic , and religious discrimination than we like to admit."
1	"As Republicans observe the second anniversary of President Obamas signing of the health care law this week , a new motto is emerging that could hurt the laws implementation : Repeal or nothing .Last week , an array of conservative leaders , including former Attorney General Edwin Meese III and the activists Gary Bauer , Tony Perkins and Richard Viguerie , wrote a letter to Republican lawmakers arguing against efforts to repeal an independent board empowered by the health care law to find ways to bring down Medicare costs .Not that the letter writers like the Independent Payment Advisory Board . They loathe it .I.P.A.B . is an unelected and unaccountable board of 15 bureaucrats empowered to set Medicare reimbursement rates in order to control costs , and it will mean rationed health care for our nations senior citizens ,  they wrote .But , they said , going after politically objectionable elements of the law one by one will only make the parts of the law that survive more politically palatable . The bill to repeal the board , which the House is scheduled to consider this week , is part of a troubling trend to break off the worst portions of Obamacare for individual votes , which muddies the water in this election year between those who are adamantly opposed to Obamacare and those who want to see its implementation ,  the conservatives wrote . This approach is misguided at this point in our nations national dialogue.This position is presenting a problem for the health care industry . Major legislation like the Affordable Care Act is routinely revised as it is implemented . But obvious flaws can not be remedied by Congress because conservatives oppose any legislation at all that might ease implementation , health insurance lobbyists say .That has raised the stakes for the 2012 election and the Supreme Court , which will hear three days of arguments this month on whether the law is constitutional ."
1	"As a kind of companion piece to my last post on the liberal and conservative visions for health insurance , I strongly recommend reading this post by Mike Konczal , which strikes a note that you can expect to hear sounded more often on the left if the Obamacare rollout continues to go badly . Contra conservatives suggesting that HealthCare.gov represents some kind of discrediting moment for liberalism , Konczal argues that the potential policy problems associated with a nonfunctional web portal really just point to the problems with neoliberalism  a much-debated term of art , but defined for his purposes as the post-1970s idea that social insurance should be heavy on private provisioning and means-testing ,  that it should preserve as much choice and competition as possible , and that it should be delivered at the state level or through state-and-federal coordination rather than by the federal government alone .Its precisely these elements in Obamacare , he writes , that threaten to turn an IT mess into a policy disaster , because they have forced policymakers to build exchanges with too many moving parts , figure out sliding subsidies , and make sure to fine-tune things so that health insurers play ball and stay solvent . Whereas under the older , New Deal form of liberalism ,  there would just be a straightforward universal federal guarantee of health insurance  and if the website didnt work , well , it would be an inconvenience but not really a problem for the underlying policy . ( My man Franklin Delano Roosevelt may not have known about JavaScript and agile programming ,  Konczal quips , but he knew a few things about the public provisioning of social insurance. )His post then goes on to pick up on my Sunday columns point that a neoliberal policy failure here could present problems for any kind of conservative alternative:Some of the more cartoony conservatives argue that this is a failure of liberalism because it is a failure of government planning  However , the smarter conservatives who are thinking several moves ahead ( e.g . Ross Douthat ) understand that this failed rollout is a significant problem for conservatives . Because if all the problems are driven by means-testing , state-level decisions and privatization of social insurance , the fact that the core conservative plan for social insurance is focused like a laser beam on means-testing , block-granting and privatization is a rather large problem .To which I would just say that the problems I foresee are more political than intellectual or conceptual . If the Obamacare exchanges are a mess and the individual market is facing cost spirals , then conservatives are going to face some understandable skepticism ( more even than usual ! ) from voters if they talk up the virtues of free market health care and the individual marketplace in 2016 and beyond . But in principle , the distinction between Obamacares approach to health policy and the conservative version of means-testing , block-granting , and competitive marketplaces is clear enough . Thats because while Obamacare may be using neoliberal rather than New Deal-style means , its still chasing essentially left-of-center ends : It seeks a level of universality and comprehensiveness that conservatives dont think is necessarily worth pursuing . And its that quest , those goals , that require the complicated mandate-regulate-subsidize combination that could undo the individual marketplace if the enrollment isnt where it needs to be and the subsidies and fines and regulations arent successfully fine-tuned .In other words , pace Konczal , the potential problems with Obamacare arent necessarily driven by means-testing , state-level decisions and privatization of social insurance. Theyre driven by the laws attempt to employ these ( notionally ) decentralized means while still seeking essentially centralized ends . Thus Obamacare retains a big role for private insurers  so long as they agree to behave more like public utilities than traditional insurance companies . It leaves a major role for the states  so long as they build their exchanges and spend their Medicaid dollars the way the federal government says . It lets individuals shop for insurance plans that suit their needs  but restricts the kinds of plans that theyre allowed to buy . And this mismatch of ( or , if you prefer , dishonesty about ) means and ends does , indeed , require a level of complicated regulatory fine-tuning thats a lot more vulnerable to IT glitches than a single payer system would be .But these problems dont loom nearly as large in the conservative alternative . You arent trying to get everyone comprehensive coverage , so you can offer most people a flat tax credit rather than trying to hit a precise subsidy level for every would-be buyer . Youre trying to deal with uninsurable people separately rather than folding them into the same insurance pool as everyone else , so you dont have to promise insurance companies a vast new market of young invincibles ,  design a mandate that nudges these invincibles into the system , and then hope that enough of them sign up . And you arent trying to micromanage what happens at the state level to the same degree , so youd probably face fewer conflicts and fewer surprises the Obama White House has had to deal with on that front .Now the cost of this more decentralized approach is , admittedly , that it leads to something less than universal , comprehensive coverage . My previous post tried to tackle whether the potential benefits might outweigh that cost . But whether they do or not , at the very least such a reform would be much less vulnerable than Obamacare to the kind of problems cropping up this month ."
1	"As health reform moves to its final , make or break vote  I think its going to go through , but Ill be hanging on by my fingernails all week  Republicans are still denouncing it as a vast , evil government takeover . But they have a problem : Obamacare is very much like the Massachusetts health reform , which was not only implemented by a Republican governor , but by a governor who is a serious contender for the 2012 presidential nomination .So they insist that the two plans have nothing in common  but the only real difference they can point to is that Massachusetts didnt fund its plan in part out of Medicare savings .Of course , it couldnt . But think about this a bit more : Republicans are saying that what makes Obamacare a socialist takeover , whereas Romneycare wasnt , is the fact that unlike Romneys plan , Obamas plan cuts government spending .Oh , Kay ."
1	"As long as Im talking about alternative health care bills , its worth lingering over some of the latest news about the bill we actually got . First , the C.B.O . has released a new estimate of how much additional discretionary spending  on implementation costs , further subsidies for new and existing programs , etc .  health care reform is likely to generate over the first 10 years . The total comes to $ 115 billion above and beyond the official price tag , a sum that would almost wipe out the bills projected deficit savings in the first decade .Keep in mind that  as Ezra Klein points out  this is spending that Congress will need to appropriate anew every year , and since were ( theoretically ) operating under a domestic spending freeze , it will ( theoretically ) all have to be offset with cuts elsewhere , or else be voted down . So that $ 115 billion estimate might not be quite as bad as it sounds . But given how hard it is to find offsets and/or kill off existing programs , the C.B.O . estimate certainly isnt good news for Americas finances .Nor is the news that Reihan Salam took note of last week , which bears on one of the potential fiscal time bombs embedded in reform  namely , the possibility that far more companies will offload their employees into the new government-run exchanges than the C.B.O.s official estimate predicts . Theres a penalty for dropping coverage , but for many employers the move would end up saving them ( and their workers ) a lot of money , the penalty notwithstanding . And if enough decide to take advantage , the government could find itself spending billions more in subsidies than the C.B.O.s projections anticipate , driving health care reform deep into the red .Now a Fortune piece offers evidence that a number of large employers are considering doing exactly that . It comes courtesy of Henry Waxman , who helpfully demanded that AT & T , Verizon , Caterpillar and Deere turn over internal documents justifying their post-reform writedowns . These documents , it turns out , included internal memos weighing the pros and cons of dropping coverage:AT & T produced a PowerPoint slide entitled Medical Cost Versus No Coverage Penalty. A document prepared for Verizon by consulting firm Hewitt Resources stated , Even though the proposed assessments [ on companies that do not provide health care ] are material , they are modest when compared to the average cost of health care ,  and that to avoid costs and regulations , employers may consider exiting the health care market and send employees to the Exchanges. ( Under the new bill , employees who lose their coverage will purchase health care through state-run exchanges . )Kenneth Huhn , vice president of labor relations at Deere , said in an internal email that his company should look at the alternatives to providing health benefits , which would amount to denying coverage and just paying the penalty ,  and that he felt he already had the ability to make this change under his companys labor agreement . Caterpillar felt it would have to give serious consideration to the penalty option .Its these analyses  which show its a lot cheaper to pay than to play  that threaten to overthrow the traditional architecture of health care .Of course that traditional employer-based architecture is a mess anyway , so theres a sense in which the more people who shift on to the exchanges the better . The problem is figuring out how to pay for it . In an ideal world , Washington would respond to a bigger-than-anticipated shift by slashing the subsidies and deregulating the exchanges , until you ended up with a system where the federal government was effectively paying for universal catastrophic coverage , rather than trying to subsidize comprehensive insurance . ( The end result would be something that looked a bit like Wyden-Bennett , and a bit like Judd Greggs stillborn compromise . )But in a less-than-ideal world , the Fortune piece notes , the fiscal picture will get very ugly very quickly:What does it mean for health care reform if the employer-sponsored regime collapses ? By Fortunes reckoning , each person whos dropped would cost the government an average of around $ 2,100 after deducting the extra taxes collected on their additional pay . So if 50 % of people covered by company plans get dumped , federal health care costs will rise by $ 160 billion a year in 2016 , in addition to the $ 93 billion in subsidies already forecast by the CBO .Ill leave the last word to The New Yorkers John Cassidy , discussing just this problem with the current reform package : At that point , if it comes , politicians of both parties will be back close to where they began : searching for health-care reform that provides adequate coverage for all at a cost the country can afford . What would such a system look like ? That is a topic for another post , but I dont think it would look much like Romney-ObamaCare."
1	"As my colleague Margot Sanger-Katz notes , a Supreme Court ruling against the Obama administration in King v. Burwell would cause significant disarray in health insurance markets , by denying subsidies to anyone buying health insurance on the individual market in states that rely on the federal health insurance exchange .Just because some insurance markets would become a mess does not mean Republicans and Democrats would come back to the table to fix them .Health insurance would become unaffordable for many people who do not get it through work or Medicare . The individual mandate wouldnt apply to people who couldnt afford coverage without a subsidy . And as healthy people drop out of the insurance market because of rising costs , the pool of participants could get sicker , driving premiums up further , driving even more people out of the market , and leading to what is known as a death spiral where only a handful of mostly very sick people buy insurance at a very high price .That would be a bad outcome . But it would not necessarily be an unsustainable one . I know , because this situation was sustained in New York for over two decades before Obamacare came into being .Two cornerstones of the Affordable Care Act are policies called community rating and guaranteed issue . Community rating means a health insurer cant set the price of your insurance policy based on how much its likely to cost to cover you . Guaranteed issue means they must sell health insurance to anyone who wants it . These policies mean that healthy people will tend to pay more for insurance than they get back in claims , and sick people will tend to pay less than they get back .To make the market work , you have to induce healthy people to buy insurance thats worth less than it costs . The health law does this by offering subsidies to people who buy insurance , imposing penalties on people who dont , and limiting insurance purchases to a short open enrollment period of just a few weeks each year , so people dont wait until they get sick to buy coverage . A ruling for the plaintiffs in King would abolish the subsidies in some states and significantly weaken the individual mandate , too .Before 2014 , New York also had community rating and guaranteed issue . But it didnt have an individual mandate , premium subsidies or a limited open enrollment period . The result was that insurance was extremely expensive in the individual market , and very few people bought it .As of 2008 , just 2 in 1,000 New York State residents were covered through the individual insurance market . In 2012 , when I was a freelancer , I considered buying insurance in the individual market ; I found that a plan approximating my prior employer coverage would have cost about $ 16,000 a year . In the group market , which was not totally dysfunctional , my prior employer was paying less than $ 6,000 for similar coverage .This was terrible public policy that led to a lot of people going uninsured . ( For my mothers benefit , Ill note that I remained on my former employers plan through 2012 , as permitted for a limited period under the federal law known as Cobra . ) But it was not unsustainable policy . New York started guaranteed issue and community rating in the early 1990s and went through two decades of individual market dysfunction .Its not hard to understand why . Repealing community rating ( i.e. , letting insurance companies charge sick people more ) is unpopular . Providing subsidies so healthy people find it affordable and appealing to buy insurance is expensive . So New York stuck with a set of policies in which health insurance was available to everyone at a price that was affordable to almost no one .There seems to be an idea among some conservatives that a post-King reality would be so messy and untenable that Democrats would have to come back to the table to cut a new deal on health reform . But King could just create a bunch of new New Yorks , where the individual insurance market doesnt work , and nobody does anything to fix it .The dysfunction would be especially sustainable since death spirals under King probably wouldnt be quite as severe as in New York . Thats because the A.C.A . uses a modified version of community rating in which prices can vary based on age , and because the limited period for open enrollment still provides a disincentive to forgo insurance coverage if you are healthy . So , not as many healthy people would flee the market as they did in New York .Still , premiums would rise , as would the percentage of the population without insurance , and Democrats would have a simple prescription : Introduce a state-based insurance exchange , and the market will function again because the subsidies will flow again . The politics of the situation would probably be similar to the politics of the Medicaid expansion now , with Democrats saying its crazy to turn down free money , doctors and hospitals ( and the uninsured ) saying that even more loudly , and Republicans being caught between the broad interests of the electorate and the Obamacare hatred of their base .As with the Medicaid expansion , some Republican officials would choose to cooperate with the health care law . Their argument for doing so would be even stronger than with the Medicaid expansion , for two reasons . One is that while the federal government pays for most of the cost of the Medicaid expansion , it pays for the entire cost of subsidies for individual market health insurance plans .The other is that , by imposing community rating and guaranteed issue on the whole country , the A.C.A . has prevented states from returning to the previous status quo in their individual health insurance markets . A ruling that overturns King wont just take away subsidies from people with low and moderate incomes ; it will drive up premiums for everyone in the individual health insurance markets in every state that does not run its own exchange . And while affordability tests will exclude many low- and moderate-income people in these states from the individual mandate , some people with higher incomes will be ordered to buy these newly expensive plans or else face a penalty .Republican state officials will be able to say ( accurately ) that the federal government has imposed costly and disruptive regulations on the state that can be managed effectively only by taking the federal money . That is , they can set up a state exchange , while bitterly complaining that the odious President Obama left them no choice but to do so .Or , they can stand firm and let their individual insurance markets become dysfunctional . It worked for New York . Sort of ."

A showdown goes airborne over a metropolis .It could be the finale of a dozen superhero films , with one difference : `` Big Hero 6 '' is animated . But the majority of comic-book films are also computer-generated , particularly their large set pieces . Never has that been clearer than witnessing just how similar such scenes look as out-and-out cartoons . It 's a little like seeing that the superhero has no clothes .The 3-D `` Big Hero 6 '' is loosely based on a little-known Marvel comic about a team of superheros . Crafting a more kid-friendly version , Disney ( which owns Marvel ) has focused on one of the heroes , the aptly named Hiro Hamada ( voiced by Ryan Potter ) .With his older brother , Tadashi ( Daniel Henney ) and their aunt Cass ( Maya Rudolph ) , the 14-year-old Hiro lives in San Fransokyo , a beautifully rendered fusion of Tokyo and San Francisco , full of both nighttime neon and steep-hilled , Bay-area panoramas .Hiro , whose parents died when he was a toddler , is an avid gamer happy to use his technical wizardry hustling unwitting competitors in underground `` bot fights . '' His tiny , gingerbread man-sized robot makes mincemeat of more hulking machines .Tadashi disapproves but does n't lecture Hiro , instead casually exposing him to his college , San Fransokyo Tech . Though Hiro initially dismisses it as `` nerd school , '' he discovers it to be a vibrant breeding ground of invention . He 's wowed by Tadashi 's schoolmates  Wasabi ( Damon Wayans Jr. ) , Honey Lemon ( Genesis Rodriguez ) , Gogo ( Jamie Chung ) and Fred ( T.J. Miller )  and their gizmos .None is more impressive than Tadashi 's robot , a marshmallow balloon `` personal health care consultant '' named Baymax ( Scott Adsit ) , created with a `` non-threatening , huggable '' design . He 's like an Obamacare dream , had the president drifted off during a Michelin commercial .With a quick scan , he can diagnose any ailment . Looking Hiro over and detecting mood swings , he pronounces : `` Diagnosis : Puberty . '' When his battery life wanes , he loses air pressure and begins to drunkenly slur his speech .In short , he 's an irresistible Disney supporting player , one who will give Groot , the soulful treelike alien of `` Guardians of the Galaxy , '' a run for sidekick-of-the-year .After a mysterious fiery accident at an invention showcase , Hiro and Baymax set off on an adventure that will gradually gather all the expected superhero conventions , slowly draining the movie 's innovative Silicon Valley spirit .So buoyant is the first half of `` Big Hero 6 '' and so colorful is its bright , Japanese anime-inspired palette , that the film 's slide into familiar comic book-movie ruts comes as a disappointment . Could it not have stayed in its rich robotics world as a high-tech high-school tale ? Are such Earth-bound stories no longer possible for big-studio animation ? Ca n't a kid grow up without flying up ?Directed by Don Hall ( `` Winnie the Pooh '' ) and Chris Williams ( `` Bolt '' ) , `` Big Hero 6 '' is a fine blend of sweetness and spectacle , East and West . The meeting of Disney and Marvel sensibilities , though , is a more mixed union . When the young Hiro and the lovable Baymax strap on the body armor , girding for battle , the movie 's charms are camouflaged .`` Big Hero 6 '' is preceded by a lovely little short , `` Feast , '' a tale of a Boston Terrier 's devotion to his owner , told exclusively , and cleverly , through mealtime .

1	"As the promoters of a sweeping education referendum in Colorado look to Election Day next Tuesday , they worry about many factors , including what kind of voter turnout they can expect in an off year and whether Americans in an anti-tax era will choose to pay more , as the referendum calls on them to do , even if the money is guaranteed for kids and schools .They worry about something else , too .Obamacare .Its their unlucky timing that theyre asking Coloradans to give the government an extra $ 950 million a year at a moment when the botched Obamacare rollout is in the news and being easilyand inevitablycast as an example of government incompetence .I wrote about the referendum , on whats called Amendment 66 , in my Tuesday column , which provides details on the tax increase and the shrewd grab bag of education reforms it would buy . I absolutely think theyre worth the price .And I quoted the savvy chief architect of the education overhaul , Mike Johnston , a young Democratic state senator who has become a deeply admired figure among education reformers nationwide .In one of our telephone conversations , Johnston noted that he makes four or five speeches to voters about Amendment 66 every day , and that over the last week , people in his audiences have begun , with some frequency , to bring up the Obamacare rollout . The proposed Colorado education overhaul includes a promise of greater transparency : specifically , that parents can go to a web site and navigate it to see exactly how much of the states allotment of funds for their child is being used for classroom instruction versus administration or something else . This would be a new service .Ill get questions from groups when we talk about the transparency we want to provide ,  Johnston told me . Theyll say , I hope its not being done by the same people who are running the Obamacare site.These arent just little barbs , he said .The impact of both the shutdown and the Obamacare rollout is that its become very easy for people to lose faith in the effectiveness of government ,  he said .Thats one of the truly infuriating and insidious aspects of the Obama administrations bungling of the web site , and its a consequence that could linger long after the web site is fixed . At a time of great skepticism about what big government can provide and how fully it can be trusted , the Obama administration let its signature policy add to those doubts and become fodder for people who maintain that government must always be shrunken and that all genius dwells in the private sector . The rollout will potentially undermine faith in much more than just the Affordable Care Act .My colleague Michael D. Shear articulated this well in a story in The Times over the weekend . He wrote:In his biggest and most important speeches , the president often talks with passion about a smarter , more effective government. He has called on Congress to embrace and pay for a 21st century government thats open and competent. And he has vowed to work to rebuild peoples faith in the institution of government.But in the pursuit of that lofty goal , Mr. Obama faces determined opposition from conservatives who view government as the problem , not the solution . And to succeed , he must win over an increasingly skeptical public whose trust in government has eroded over decades . A survey last week by the Pew Research Center found that just 19 percent of Americans trust government to do what is right just about always or most of the time .The breakdown of the federal HealthCare.gov Web site could emerge as a test of Mr. Obamas philosophy , with potentially serious implications for an agenda that relies heavily on the belief in a can-do bureaucracy . Michael Dimock , the Pew centers director , said that the longer the problems persist , the more they could bolster what he called the almost American value that government is inefficient.On the heels of Shears story was another fascinating report from another colleague at The Times , Trip Gabriel , who notes how far state governors are separating themselves from whats happening in Washington . Heres a snippet:Ever since Republicans in Congress shut down the federal government in an attempt to remove funding for President Obamas health care law , Republican governors have been trying to distance themselves from Washington .Gov . Scott Walker of Wisconsin schooled lawmakers in a Washington Post opinion column midway through the 16-day shutdown on What Wisconsin Can Teach Washington. Gov . Chris Christie of New Jersey , with a record of bipartisan support at home , remarked after a visit to the nations capital , If I was in the Senate right now , Id kill myself.Those governors are beating up not just a Democratic administration but also their Republican kinfolk on Capitol Hill . And theyre doing something bigger in the process : trying to make sure voters dont conflate state governments with the federal government . These governors know that there may be big things they want and need to get done , and if voters turn off on government in generalon all of itthen voters wont follow them when they need for that to happen .Johnston , in fact , said hes experienced firsthand the way voters can fail to make distinctions between different levels of government and can see government as one big morass , one big mess . During the federal shutdown , he said , he sometimes fielded questions about whether , as a state senator , he had the day off . Of course he didnt .To this point , he said , the shutdown has had a much more corrosive effect on trust in government than the Obamacare rollout , though the latter hasnt helped matters . He worries that the two together have made the challenge of selling Amendment 66 tougher than it might otherwise have been .The big question is : do you trust government to be good stewards of your money at this time in American history ?  he said . And the context in Washington makes that doubtful."
1	"At this point , the crisis in American governance has taken on a life of its own . Some Republicans are now saying openly that they want concessions in return for reopening the government and avoiding default , not because they have any specific policy goals in mind , but simply because they dont want to feel disrespected. And no endgame is in sight .But this confrontation did start with a real issue : Republican efforts to stop Obamacare from going into effect . Its long been clear that the great fear of the Republican Party was not that health reform would fail , but that it would succeed . And developments since Tuesday , when the exchanges on which individuals will buy health insurance opened for business , strongly suggest that their worst fears will indeed be realized : This thing is going to work .Wait a minute , some readers are saying . Havent many stories so far been of computer glitches , of people confronting screens telling them that servers are busy and that they should try again later ? Indeed , they have . But everyone knowledgeable about the process always expected some teething problems , and the nature of this weeks problems has actually been hugely encouraging for supporters of the program .First , let me say a word about the underlying irrelevance of start-up troubles for new government programs .Political reporting in America , especially but not only on TV , tends to be focused on the play-by-play . Who won todays news cycle ? And , to be fair , this sort of thing may matter during the final days of an election .But Obamacare isnt up for a popular referendum , or a revote of any kind . Its the law , and its going into effect . Its future will depend on how it works over the next few years , not the next few weeks .To illustrate the point , consider Medicare Part D , the drug benefit , which went into effect in 2006 . It had what was widely considered a disastrous start , with seniors unclear on their benefits , pharmacies often refusing to honor valid claims , computer problems , and more . In the end , however , the program delivered lasting benefits , and woe unto any politician proposing that it be rolled back .So the glitches of October wont matter in the long run . But why are they actually encouraging ? Because they appear , for the most part , to be the result of the sheer volume of traffic , which has been much heavier than expected . And this means that one big worry of Obamacare supporters  that not enough people knew about the program , so that many eligible Americans would fail to sign up  is receding fast .Of course , its important that people who want to sign up can actually do so . But the computer problems can and will be fixed . So , by March 31 , when enrollment for 2014 closes , we can be reasonably sure that millions of Americans who were previously uninsured will have coverage under the Affordable Care Act . Obamacare will have become a reality , something people depend on , rather than some fuzzy notion Republicans could demonize . And it will be very hard to take that coverage away .What we still dont know , and is crucial for the programs longer-term success , is who will sign up . Will there be enough young , healthy enrollees to provide a favorable risk pool and keep premiums relatively low ? Bear in mind that conservative groups have been spending heavily  and making some seriously creepy ads  in an effort to dissuade young people from signing up for insurance . Nonetheless , insurance companies are betting that young people will , in fact , sign up , as shown by the unexpectedly low premiums theyre offering for next year .And the insurers are probably right . To see why anti-Obamacare messaging is probably doomed to fail , think about whom were talking about here . That is , who are the healthy uninsured individuals the program needs to reach ? Well , theyre by and large not affluent , because affluent young people tend to get jobs with health coverage . And theyre disproportionately nonwhite .In other words , to get a description of the typical person Obamacare needs to enroll , just take the description of a typical Tea Party member or Fox News viewer  older , affluent , white  and put a not in front of each characteristic . These are people the right-wing message machine is not set up to talk to , but who can be reached through many of the same channels , from ads on Spanish-language media to celebrity tweets , that turned out Obama voters last year . I have to admit , I find the image of hard-line conservatives defeated by an army of tweeting celebrities highly attractive ; but its also realistic . Enrollment is probably going to be just fine .So Obamacare is off to a good start , with even the bad news being really good news for the programs future . Were not quite there yet , but more and more , it looks as if health reform is here to stay ."
1	"BATON ROUGE , La .  An old political standby  the future of Medicare  is emerging as the go-to issue in Louisiana 's bitter Senate race as the candidates woo seniors who typically wield strong influence in midterm elections .The challenge for voters is to figure out which side , if either , is telling the whole truth about who would cut and who would protect the popular insurance program . Medicare serves more than 50 million people and accounts for about 15 percent of federal spending , with about 10,000 new beneficiaries added daily as baby boomers reach age 65 . The issue is so powerful that it 's cropping up in North Carolina and Iowa , too , amid a national battle for control of the Senate .Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu got hundreds of seniors grumbling at a recent forum when she told them her top Republican rival , Rep. Bill Cassidy , wants to turn Medicare into a `` voucher system '' and has voted to raise the retirement age to make Americans wait longer for benefits .`` No wonder Bill Cassidy did n't come today , because he did n't want you to know this , '' said Landrieu , who finds herself in another tough re-election bid as she seeks a fourth term .Landrieu has made the issue of entitlement programs for the elderly a centerpiece of her campaign , traveling Tuesday to three senior centers across south Louisiana to announce a new endorsement from the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare , a Washington-based advocacy group .The Senate Democrats ' campaign arm has aired an ad against Cassidy featuring three older white women  a crucial demographic for Landrieu in a state that President Barack Obama twice lost badly  bemoaning Cassidy 's plan that `` ( requires ) seniors to buy private insurance with fewer benefits and higher costs . '' Democrats have hit Iowa Republican Senate nominee Joni Ernst with similar ads .Cassidy and his backers answer that it 's Landrieu who cut Medicare when she voted in 2010 for Obama 's signature health care overhaul , which reduced payments for private policies under the Medicare Advantage program .Americans for Prosperity , the political action organization backed by the conservative billionaire Koch brothers , Charles and David , cites that Affordable Care Act vote in similar ads opposing Landrieu and her North Carolina colleague , Sen. Kay Hagan .The three races are among the handful that will decide which party controls the Senate for the final two years of Obama 's presidency . Republicans must net six more seats for a majority .The back-and-forth reprises a major theme of the 2012 presidential election . Obama and Republican nominee Mitt Romney leveled the same attacks , with Romney prevailing among voters older than 55 . The issue also helped Republicans in 2010 , when the GOP used dissatisfaction and confusion over the new health care law to win a House majority .While Republican Medicare attacks are based on the health care law , the Democratic attacks are based mostly on House Republicans ' budget blueprint , the Paul `` Ryan Budget , '' so-named for the Wisconsin congressman and budget chairman who was Romney 's running mate .The Affordable Care Act changed how Medicare pays doctors and hospitals and included reductions  the $ 700 billion in cuts the GOP cites  in Medicare Advantage , which allows seniors in certain markets to purchase coverage from private insurers .Ryan 's budgets , meanwhile , propose a long-term shift to a voucher system for seniors ' health care , where beneficiaries would get taxpayer money and then choose among traditional Medicare and private policies sold on the open market  similar to the exchanges the health care law set up for working-age Americans . The House has stopped short of passing legislation that would actually implement the overhauls assumed in their budget plans , and the budget votes have been largely symbolic anyway since Republicans have the political cover of a Democratic Senate , which routinely kills legislation passed in the House .Medicare 's latest annual report , issued this summer , projects that the program 's hospital trust fund wo n't be exhausted until 2030 , at which time payroll taxes are projected to cover just 85 percent of Medicare 's costs . Yet each side persists in attacking the other 's proposals as untenable `` cuts . ''`` The $ 700 billion that Obamacare cut from Medicare spends it on other programs , '' Cassidy said , referring to the law shifting some health care spending to premium subsidies for working-age policy holders . `` The $ 700 billion in the Ryan budget puts it back into the trust fund . ''Landrieu and Democrats argue that the new law covers more Americans and , thus , lowers health care costs across the board by saving on treating the uninsured .Democrats also note Congressional Budget Office projections that premiums for traditional Medicare could nearly double under the Ryan proposal , leaving seniors to choose the more expensive public insurance or less expensive private plans with lower benefits and more out-of-pocket expenses .Analyses from the insurance industry and independent groups note that under both parties ' models there would be rural areas where private firms may not offer policies at all .Landrieu 's most aggressive criticism of Republican Medicare plans , meanwhile , ignores that the changes would not affect anyone who is old enough now to qualify for Medicare . That means none of those voters Landrieu stirred up at a senior center would be forced off traditional coverage under plans Cassidy has supported .Nonetheless , Landrieu defends her attacks . `` You can only judge what somebody 's going to do based on what they 've already done , '' she said .___Barrow reported from Atlanta .

1	"BATON ROUGE , La .  The last of the Deep South 's statewide elected Democrats are hoping their seniority and famous family names will save them from the region 's rightward trend in this year 's Senate races . But Republicans say only one name matters in these rapidly realigning states : Barack Obama .In Louisiana and Arkansas , Republican Senate candidates appear increasingly confident that they can focus almost exclusively on their opponents ' ties to the president , who lost both states badly . They say it 's time for the two states to bring Senate elections in line with the heavy GOP tilt of recent presidential results .It no longer matters , Republicans say , that Sens . Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Mark Pryor of Arkansas hail from famous Democratic families and have seniority in Washington .`` We 're running against Sen. Landrieu and Barack Obama , '' says Rep. Bill Cassidy , a Republican seeking to end Landrieu 's career at 18 years . Asked about the legacies of Landrieu 's father , Moon , and brother Mitch  the former and current mayors of New Orleans  Cassidy shrugged .`` If you go to our focus groups , I do n't know if her name matters as much , '' he said . He said voters instead note that `` she voted for health care , and she says she 'd vote for it again . '' He was referring to the president 's health care overhaul , also known as `` Obamacare . ''In Arkansas , Pryor emphasizes his home-state ties , and often mentions his father , David , who was a popular governor and senator . `` When my dad was governor , '' Pryor told retirees in Pine Bluff on Wednesday , `` he had a big senior initiative '' called Area Agency on Aging .His Republican opponent , Rep. Tom Cotton , focuses on more recent history . He says Pryor `` votes 93 percent of the time with Barack Obama , '' and that should disqualify him in a state the president lost by 24 percentage points .Pryor and Landrieu are campaigning hard , imploring voters to reward their seniority and familiarity even if it means keeping Obama 's party in control of the Senate .`` I 've lived here my whole life , '' Landrieu told a Baton Rouge gathering on a warm afternoon . She said her brother , `` the New Orleans mayor , '' is working with her to end homelessness among military veterans . And after three Senate terms , she said , she finally chairs the Senate Energy Committee , important to the state 's oil and gas industry .It 's crucial `` to maintain the seniority and the clout that we have in Washington , '' Landrieu said . `` It 's your clout , it 's not mine . It 's Louisiana 's clout . ''GOP leaders say seniority is a poor excuse for electing Democrats in a state that overwhelmingly rejected Obama and put Republicans in control of the state government . Landrieu `` uses her clout for Barack Obama , '' Cassidy says .Moon Landrieu and David Pryor prospered in a time when Democrats dominated their states , and residents put higher values on pork barrel projects , committee chairmanships and other fruits of seniority . These Democratic family legacies , southern politicians say , are increasingly imperiled by hostility to Obama and Democrats ' national image .For Landrieu , `` it makes it very , very difficult for re-election , '' said Jonathan Dean , the Democratic mayor of the small , central Louisiana town of Ball .Dean calls himself `` a conservative , pro-life , pro-Second Amendment Democrat , '' a brand still successful in many local southern elections . In a sign of Landrieu 's challenge , he 's endorsing no one in the Senate race .Landrieu replaced her campaign manager this week , and Cassidy cites polls showing him ahead . He has agreed to only two October debates with Landrieu , who says he 's afraid to have more encounters .She pointed to his empty seat at a recent evening forum in the somber city council chambers of Kenner . Landrieu dryly thanked tea party-backed Republican Rob Maness `` for having the guts '' to attend .Maness , seen as running a distant third , attacks Landrieu and Cassidy about equally . His presence raises the likelihood of a Dec. 6 runoff , probably between Cassidy and Landrieu .In Louisiana 's `` jungle primary , '' all candidates , regardless of party , run on the Nov. 4 ballot . If no one exceeds 50 percent , the top two finishers enter a runoff .In a runoff , Republicans will `` have the enthusiasm advantage , '' said GOP Sen. David Vitter of Louisiana . Speaking at a National Right to Life endorsement of Cassidy , Vitter called Landrieu `` truly extremist . ''Landrieu , sometimes speaking in the third person , says she 's a centrist `` willing to cross party lines '' to help her state with matters such as flood insurance . Congress is often gridlocked by partisanship , she told the Kenner forum , `` but Mary Landrieu and the way I work is not . ''Some people wonder whether Cassidy is playing it too safe , relying almost entirely on anti-Obama sentiment and overlooking Landrieu 's history of scratching out tough wins .`` I do n't think he has defended himself enough '' and explained his positions , said Joanie Bernius of Metarie , who attended the Kenner forum . Bernius said she has voted for Landrieu before but no longer tolerates her support for legalized abortion .___Associated Press Special Correspondent David Espo in Pine Bluff , Arkansas , contributed to this report ."
1	"BATON ROUGE , La .  U.S. Sen. Mary Landrieu has doubled down on her support for the federal health care law even as polls show the revamp remains unpopular in Louisiana and a new Republican attack ad launched Tuesday hits the Democratic incumbent again for her vote .The 30-second TV commercial by national conservative group Crossroads GPS , co-founded by GOP operative Karl Rove , says Landrieu 's vote for President Barack Obama 's signature initiative was a betrayal of Louisiana .Although criticism of Landrieu 's vote for the law known as `` Obamacare '' has continued throughout the election season , the three-term senator has n't sidestepped the issue . In the latest Senate race debate Monday night in New Orleans , Landrieu offered a direct defense of the law in advance of the Nov. 4 election .She said while the health overhaul needs adjustments , it will improve health care access .`` I 'm telling you this is a good bill . It 's not perfect , '' Landrieu said . She added : `` I will defend it . I will improve it . And I will fight for it . ''Landrieu is a target for national Republicans as they seek to regain control of the Senate . She is the only Democratic statewide elected official in Louisiana , which strongly supported Mitt Romney in 2012 . If no candidate gets a majority of the vote next week , the Senate race will head to a Dec. 6 runoff .Landrieu 's GOP opponents , U.S. Rep. Bill Cassidy and retired Air Force colonel Rob Maness , have repeatedly attacked her on the health care law . Both are campaigning on repeal of the law and accuse Landrieu of being a rubber stamp for Obama .In the New Orleans debate , which Cassidy did n't attend , Maness described the law as `` an abomination '' and a job-killer for small businesses . To lower health care costs , he said , Congress should not mandate coverage but consider allowing people to buy insurance across state lines and keep their insurance when they change jobs .Landrieu said the law is `` based on free market principles . '' She said she 'd like to see a lower-cost set of insurance plans offered , but also defended existing coverage options .`` Seventy percent of the people in our state , households , make less than $ 50,000 . The Affordable Care Act is the first act that 's given those families a chance to buy insurance , and the average premium is $ 83 a month for them . That 's affordable , '' Landrieu said .Despite Landrieu 's continued support for the health law passed in 2010 , the issue is n't a winning one in her home state .A USA Today/Suffolk University poll released this week shows 62 percent of Louisiana voters surveyed believe the federal health law is `` generally bad '' for the state .More than 100,000 people in Louisiana signed up for private insurance coverage through the federally-run marketplace created by the law , which offers subsidized options for people who do n't get insurance through their jobs or a government program like Medicare .But Republicans point to double-digit premium hikes for many of those policies next year and penalties for people who refuse to get insurance .Meanwhile , much of the expanded coverage authorized through the federal law has n't trickled down to Louisiana . Gov . Bobby Jindal , a Republican considering a 2016 presidential campaign , has refused to expand Louisiana 's Medicaid program , rejecting the federally-funded coverage that could have been offered to the working poor ."
1	"BERKELEY Calif. ( Reuters ) - Voters in California 's Alameda County passed a measure on Tuesday that is expected to raise $ 100 million a year for health clinics for illegal immigrants , who are excluded from state programs and the federal Affordable Care Act , or Obamacare .On May 23 a measure to include illegal immigrants in the state 's Medi-Cal program for the poor to residents who are undocumented stalled in the state senate , and immigration reform proposals have also stalled in U.S. Congress for the past year .The measure extends a 0.5 percent sales tax to fund the clinics to 2034 from 2019 .`` Our elected officials , our constituents , and our health authority see healthcare as a basic human right , to be provided regardless of immigration status , '' Alex Briscoe , Director of the Alameda County Health Care Services Agency , said .About 7 percent of California 's population - 2.6 million people - are undocumented , and in 2012 the state spent more than $ 600 million on emergency room and other health-related services alone for people living in the state illegally .Many of those who used the facilities in the past will now be eligible for insurance under Obamacare or the Medi-Cal program , leaving a potential funding gap for the clinics that are already struggling to meet the needs of patients expected to be increasingly those without documents or health insurance .Alameda County , which includes the cities of Berkeley and Oakland east of San Francisco , funds health care services for about 50,000 undocumented residents at the clinics .The measure passed by a nearly 3-to-1 margin with all precincts reporting results early on Wednesday .( Reporting by Jennifer Chaussee ; Editing by Sharon Bernstein and Louise Ireland )"
1	"BIRMINGHAM , Alabama  A congressional candidate in Alabama is taking aim - literally - at the federal statute known as Obamacare in a new campaign advertisement in which he fires rounds from several weapons into a paper copy of the healthcare reform law .Will Brooke , a Birmingham businessman , is one of seven Republican candidates seeking to replace U.S. Representative Spencer Bachus , who is retiring .In the video , released on Wednesday , Brooke loads a thick stack of papers into a target and then fires multiple rounds from a pistol , rifle and AR-15 assault rifle at it .

1	"BOSTON  A group of cyber security professionals is warning that the U.S. government has failed to implement fixes to protect the HealthCare.gov website from hackers , some three months after experts first pointed out the problem .David Kennedy , head of computer security consulting firm TrustedSec LLC , told Reuters that the government has yet to plug more than 20 vulnerabilities that he and other security experts reported to the government shortly after HealthCare.gov went live on October 1 .Hackers could steal personal information , modify data or attack the personal computers of the website 's users , he said . They could also damage the infrastructure of the site , according to Kennedy , who is scheduled to describe his security concerns in testimony on Thursday before the House Science , Space and Technology Committee .`` These issues are alarming , '' Kennedy said in an interview on Wednesday .The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services , the federal agency that oversees the site 's operations , provided Reuters with a statement saying it takes the concerns seriously .`` To date there have been no successful security attacks on HealthCare.gov and no person or group has maliciously accessed personally identifiable information from the site , '' the statement said .`` Security testing is conducted on an ongoing basis using industry best practices to appropriately safeguard consumers ' personal information . ''HealthCare.gov lets consumers shop for insurance plans under President Barack Obama 's Affordable Care Act , which mandates health insurance for all Americans .The site , which is meant to serve millions of consumers in 36 states , was crippled by technology errors in the first two months after its launch on October 1 . The Obama administration 's efforts to repair the site helped it to work more smoothly beginning in December , but problems with data transmission remain .Kennedy said he last week presented technical details describing the vulnerabilities in the site to seven independent cyber security experts , who reviewed videos of potential attack methods as well as logs and other documentation .They wrote notes to the House Committee saying they were concerned about the site 's security , which Kennedy provided to Reuters and will be released on Thursday to the committee led by Republicans who oppose the Affordable Care Act .Members of the security community have been publicly pointing out problems with the site and say they have been privately providing the government with technical details of those issues since early October .At a November Science Committee hearing , Kennedy and three other expert witnesses said they believed the site was not secure and three of them said it should be shut down immediately .'FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED 'Kennedy and his peers who reviewed his work ahead of Thursday 's hearing said the site still has serious security vulnerabilities that can be viewed from the outside .`` The site is fundamentally flawed in ways that make it dangerous to people who use it , '' said Kevin Johnson , one of the experts who reviewed Kennedy 's findings .Johnson said that one of the most troubling issues was that a hacker could upload malicious code to the site , then attack other HealthCare.gov users .`` You can take control of their computers , '' said Johnson , chief executive of a firm known as Secure Ideas and a teacher at the non-profit SANS Institute , the world 's biggest organization that trains and certifies cyber security professionals .He declined to provide further details about that vulnerability , saying he was concerned the information could be used by malicious hackers to launch attacks .Kennedy said he learned of that particular attack method from another security researcher who had identified and tested it .Yet Kennedy said he identified many other problems on his own , conducting what is known as `` passive analysis '' of the site , by using an ordinary Web browser and other software tools to look at HealthCare.gov 's content and architecture from the outside .He said he did not take the additional step of hacking into the site to look for other problems because he did not have permission from the government .'ONLY SPECULATING 'Waylon Krush , chief executive of a firm known as Lunarline that has done security work for the Department of Health and Human Services , said he questions Kennedy 's conclusions that were drawn without launching attacks on the website .`` Anybody who brings testimony that says there is a vulnerability on HealthCare.gov is only speculating unless they have actually executed the code , at which point they are hacking a government website and that would be illegal , '' said Krush , who will also testify before the committee on Thursday .Krush said he has not reviewed Kennedy 's findings or done any work on the HealthCare.gov site itself .`` If I said everything was perfect , I would just be speculating because I did not work on the site , '' he said .One security flaw that Kennedy first uncovered and reported to the government in October exposes information including a user 's full name and email address . He said he wrote a short computer program in five minutes that automatically collects that data , which was able to import some 70,000 records in about four minutes .He said the information was accessible via the Internet and he did not have to hack the site to get it . He declined to elaborate .John Strand , a principal with Black Hills Information Security and a SANS Institute trainer who also reviewed Kennedy 's findings , said he was concerned about what might have been uncovered if Kennedy had conducted a more in-depth probe and actually attempted to hack into the site .He said he supports a recent move by the House of Representatives to force the government to disclose breaches whenever they occur . The government is generally not required to notify the public when its systems are compromised .`` We do n't know how bad it is because they do n't have to tell us , '' Strand said .Lamar Smith , the Texas Republican chairman of the committee , said in a statement that the government should quickly move to plug the security flaws that have already been reported by security experts .`` If Americans ' information is not secure , then the theft of their identities is inevitable and dangerous , '' he said . `` The President should take swift action to ensure that the American people are not the next target of cyber criminals .

1	"BOSTON  New competition between health insurers offering so-called Obamacare plans in 2015 is having an impact on the pricing of such coverage , based on a first look at proposed insurance premiums , the head of Humana Inc said on Wednesday .The state insurance exchanges offering coverage under the Affordable Care Act . President Barack Obama 's landmark healthcare law will begin enrolling customers for 2015 benefits in mid-November . Now in its second year , Obamacare is attracting health insurers to offer plans in more states after over 8 million people enrolled for coverage in 2014 .The country 's largest insurer , UnitedHealth Group Inc , sold Obamacare plans in only a few states in 2014 . But for 2015 , it will sell plans in about two dozen states . Aetna Inc , Cigna Corp , WellPoint Inc and Humana have said they would stick to most of their markets .`` United is coming in . There is more competition coming into the marketplace . It 's going to make us all a little bit more competitive , '' Humana Chief Executive Officer Bruce Broussard said in an interview .He said that larger insurers are pricing their premiums within a narrower range of about 10 percent in many markets . That strategy contrasts with 2014 , when Obamacare plan pricing showed much greater variation .Humana will sell plans in 15 states for 2015 and has asked for premium rate increases of 3 percent to the 20 percent range , depending on the market .Last year , large insurers were hesitant to enter the new marketplace , concerned by conservatives ' political opposition as well as federal regulations that required that the plans be available to any individual regardless of age or health status .When the exchanges first launched in October 2013 , technology failures crippled the federal enrollment website , Healthcare.gov , and many websites run by individual states . But as the government fixed those problems , enrollment came in ahead of forecast .Now many insurers expect their Obamacare business to have profit margins of 2 percent to 3 percent within a few years , based on government forecasts for the market to grow to 13 million people in 2015 and 25 million by 2017 .Broussard said insurers may grapple with customer churn as consumers seek better prices as well as more technology problems as existing customers try to re-enroll either in the same plan or in a new plan for 2015 .Humana , which has about 700,000 members enrolled in Obamacare plans , has a large business providing medical benefits and prescription drug plans under the Medicare program for the elderly , and sees a risk posed by pricey new drugs expected to reach the U.S. market in the next few years .Insurers are already calling for a change in how new drugs are priced after paying more than they expected for Gilead Sciences Inc 's new $ 84,000 Hepatitis C treatment . New personalized treatments for cancer and an experimental class of cholesterol fighting drugs are seen inflating those costs further .`` We 've had a great trend over the last couple of years in healthcare cost staying flat or decreasing , '' Broussard said . `` If these drugs come out at the price they are , I think you are going to see a reversal of that .

1	"BOSTON  The failed Scottish vote to pull out from the United Kingdom stirred secessionist hopes for some in the United States , where almost a quarter of people are open to their states leaving the union , a new Reuters/Ipsos poll found .Some 23.9 percent of Americans polled from Aug. 23 through Sept. 16 said they strongly supported or tended to support the idea of their state breaking away , while 53.3 percent of the 8,952 respondents strongly opposed or tended to oppose the notion .The urge to sever ties with Washington cuts across party lines and regions , though Republicans and residents of rural Western states are generally warmer to the idea than Democrats and Northeasterners , according to the poll .Anger with President Barack Obama 's handling of issues ranging from healthcare reform to the rise of Islamic State militants drives some of the feeling , with Republican respondents citing dissatisfaction with his administration as coloring their thinking .But others said long-running Washington gridlock had prompted them to wonder if their states would be better off striking out on their own , a move no U.S. state has tried in the 150 years since the bloody Civil War that led to the end of slavery in the South .`` I do n't think it makes a whole lot of difference anymore which political party is running things . Nothing gets done , '' said Roy Gustafson , 61 , of Camden , South Carolina , who lives on disability payments . `` The state would be better off handling things on its own . ''Scottish unionists won by a wider-than-expected 10-percentage-point margin .Falling public approval of the Obama administration , attention to the Scottish vote and the success of activists who accuse the U.S. government of overstepping its authority - such as the self-proclaimed militia members who flocked to Nevada 's Bundy ranch earlier this year during a standoff over grazing rights - is driving up interest in secession , experts said .`` It seems to have heated up , especially since the election of President Obama , '' said Mordecai Lee , a professor of governmental affairs at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee , who has studied secessionist movements .'OBAMACARE ' A FACTORRepublicans were more inclined to support the idea , with 29.7 percent favoring it compared with 21 percent of Democrats .Brittany Royal , a 31-year-old nurse from Wilkesboro , North Carolina , said anger over the `` Obamacare '' healthcare reform law made her wonder if her state would be better off on its own .`` That has really hurt a lot of people here , myself included . My insurance went from $ 40 a week for a family of four up to over $ 600 a month for a family of four , '' said Royal , a Republican . `` The North Carolina government itself is sustainable . Governor ( Pat ) McCrory , I think he has a better healthcare plan than President Obama . ''By region , the idea was least popular in New England , the cradle of the Revolutionary War , with just 17.4 percent of respondents open to pulling their state out .It was most popular in the Southwest , where 34.1 percent of respondents back the idea .That region includes Texas , where an activist group is calling the state 's legislature to put the secession question on a statewide ballot . One Texan respondent said he was confident his state could get by without the rest of the country .`` Texas has everything we need . We have the manufacturing , we have the oil , and we do n't need them , '' said Mark Denny , a 59-year-old retiree living outside Dallas on disability payments .Denny , a Republican , had cheered on the Scottish independence movement .`` I have totally , completely lost faith in the federal government , the people running it , whether Republican , Democrat , independent , whatever , '' he said .Even in Texas , some respondents said talk about breaking away was more of a sign of their anger with Washington than evidence of a real desire to go it alone . Democrat Lila Guzman , of Round Rock , said the threat could persuade Washington lawmakers and the White House to listen more closely to average people 's concerns .`` When I say secede , I 'm not like ( former National Rifle Association president ) Charlton Heston with my gun up in the air , 'my cold dead hands . ' It 's more like  we could do it if we had to , '' said Guzman , 62 . `` But the first option is , golly , get it back on the right track . Not all is lost . But there might come a point that we say , 'Hey , y'all , we 're dusting our hands and we 're moving on .

''Scottish unionists won by a wider-than-expected 10-percentage-point margin .Falling public approval of the Obama administration , attention to the Scottish vote and the success of activists who accuse the U.S. government of overstepping its authority - such as the self-proclaimed militia members who flocked to Nevada 's Bundy ranch earlier this year during a standoff over grazing rights - is driving up interest in secession , experts said .`` It seems to have heated up , especially since the election of President Obama , '' said Mordecai Lee , a professor of governmental affairs at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee , who has studied secessionist movements .'OBAMACARE ' A FACTORRepublicans were more inclined to support the idea , with 29.7 percent favouring it compared with 21 percent of Democrats .Brittany Royal , a 31-year-old nurse from Wilkesboro , North Carolina , said anger over the `` Obamacare '' healthcare reform law made her wonder if her state would be better off on its own .`` That has really hurt a lot of people here , myself included . My insurance went from $ 40 a week for a family of four up to over $ 600 a month for a family of four , '' said Royal , a Republican . `` The North Carolina government itself is sustainable . Governor ( Pat ) McCrory , I think he has a better healthcare plan than President Obama . ''By region , the idea was least popular in New England , the cradle of the Revolutionary War , with just 17.4 percent of respondents open to pulling their state out .It was most popular in the Southwest , where 34.1 percent of respondents back the idea .That region includes Texas , where an activist group is calling the state 's legislature to put the secession question on a statewide ballot . One Texan respondent said he was confident his state could get by without the rest of the country .`` Texas has everything we need . We have the manufacturing , we have the oil , and we do n't need them , '' said Mark Denny , a 59-year-old retiree living outside Dallas on disability payments .Denny , a Republican , had cheered on the Scottish independence movement .`` I have totally , completely lost faith in the federal government , the people running it , whether Republican , Democrat , independent , whatever , '' he said .Even in Texas , some respondents said talk about breaking away was more of a sign of their anger with Washington than evidence of a real desire to go it alone . Democrat Lila Guzman , of Round Rock , said the threat could persuade Washington lawmakers and the White House to listen more closely to average people 's concerns .`` When I say secede , I 'm not like ( former National Rifle Association president ) Charlton Heston with my gun up in the air , 'my cold dead hands . ' It 's more like  we could do it if we had to , '' said Guzman , 62 . `` But the first option is , golly , get it back on the right track . Not all is lost . But there might come a point that we say , 'Hey , y'all , we 're dusting our hands and we 're moving on .

1	"Back to Congressional gridlock . Back to watching John Boehner provide exciting updates like were continuing to work with our members. Maybe , if the stalemate goes on long enough , he will once again tell reporters : If ands and buts were candy and nuts , every day would be Christmas. I always enjoy that part .Tra-la-la .For the last few weeks , weve been awash in worries about profound problems in foreign affairs , but now were going domestic again . Were back in budget crisis territory . Compared with Syria , it seems like a walk in the park . Good old fiscal cliffs .Its possible youve lost track of this over the summer , so I have prepared a calendar of upcoming events . Feel free to put it on the refrigerator:Sept. 23 : House of Representatives goes away . For a weeklong vacation . Because , you know , they need to see the folks back home that they didnt see when they were there all of August. Its possible that the Republican leadership will cancel their long-scheduled break rather than let it be said that the House only spent nine working days in Washington in the month before the federal government shut down . Which we would definitely be saying .Oct. 1 : Government shuts down ! Do not plan a vacation in a national park for early October .A critical chunk of House Republicans insist that they will only vote for a bill to keep government going if said legislation also defunds Obamacare . You may have noticed that House Republicans have a stupendously high opinion of health care reform . Most Democrats think it will be a very good thing over the long run , but probably a pain to implement , with lots of complaining from all sides . Republicans , on the other hand , think that the instant it goes into effect , voters will be so ecstatic they will toss out any public official who threatens to take it away from them . Yet , simultaneously , the world as we know it will come to an end . Go figure .Since neither the Senate nor the president will buy the defunding idea , Speaker Boehner came up with an interesting compromise , under which the House would pass a bill that keeps the government running and defunds Obamacare . But it would be structured so that the second part would vanish when the bill got to the Senate .There are a lot of procedural details . But , really , all you need to remember is : Boehner bill : Obamacare defunding part disappears by magic. The Tea Party faction in the House does not appear to be fooled by this maneuver .Date to be announced : Government starts up ! If there is a shutdown , it wont last long . Probably no longer than the moment when voters begin to wonder about the clerks who process Social Security checks .This is a good moment to mention the sequester . I could have brought it up earlier , but you had a lot on your plate with the disappearing Obamacare thing .Of course you remember the big , bipartisan budget deal in 2011 , with all the automatic , irrational cuts to federal agencies that would go away as soon as Congress came up with a sensible bipartisan budget plan . Just look at that sentence again , and ask yourself how we ever imagined that one would work .Weve already had one sequester , which has hacked into education funds , money for research and long-term upkeep of the parks . This week , Michael Schmidt of The Times reported that the F.B.I . has a cost-cutting plan to shut down its offices 10 days a year . In case of a terrorist attack , furloughed agents will be called in from home .The second phase will start to be felt over the next few months . Its particularly hard on defense contracts , so many members of Congress would like to see it adjusted . Some of us , of course , would prefer to get the F.B.I . back . Anyway , the issue is going to come up , and I dont want to see you throwing yourself under the bed the first time you hear the word sequester. Were better than that .Oct. 18 : First possible day for Treasury default if Congress cant come up with a bill to raise the debt ceiling . If there is no deal , financial markets around the world fall into chaos . President Obama goes to bed and has a wonderful dream in which he is working everything out with House Republicans , who are led by Kevin Spacey from House of Cards.The Republicans have myriad proposals for dealing with the debt ceiling , many involving doing something bad to Obamacare . The presidents position is that Congress has an obligation to pay our already-existing national debt , and that , therefore , he is not going to negotiate the matter at all . Maybe Vladimir Putin has an idea .Jan. 1 : New sequester cuts really kick in and first Obamacare insurance policies go into effect . The moon turns to blood . Thor , son of Odin , fights in combat with the serpent Jrmungandr . The president contemplates the fact that he has three more years in office ."
1	"Because I was teaching from 6 to 9 last night , Im behind on the big wonkverse thing of the day , the new CBO report that , among other things , increases the budget office estimates of labor supply effects ; it now says that affordable care will reduce labor supply by the equivalent of 2 million jobs .Thats a valid point . And CBO , wich has been burned before on this sort of thing , really needs to be more careful in how it states things  a lot of the press ran with the headline Obamacare costs 2 million jobs , and it will become part of what everyone on the right knows , yet is totally untrue . First of all , were mainly talking about reduced hours rather than quitting the work force . Second , as Greg Sargent and Jonathan Cohn try to explain , were talking about a voluntary , supply-side response here  people choosing to work less  not about job destruction .Still , dont we have a problem with incentive effects here ? Maybe , but maybe not . Ill write this up at greater length later , but the basic point here is that we started with a system in which incentives were already strongly distorted by the deductibility of employer-paid health insurance premiums . This was a significant benefit , but one in general available only to full-time workers .The result was to create something like the infamous notches sometimes created by welfare state benefits  but in reverse . The traditional notch comes when , say , housing subsidies are available as long as youre below 150 percent of the poverty line  which means that you have a strong disincentive to move your income from slightly below to slightly above that threshold . What we had here was , instead , a system in which subsidies were available only if you worked more than a certain amount , surely leading some people to work more than they would have wanted to otherwise .And thats not a hypothetical  I know a fair number of people in just that situation . I also know some people in job lock  feeling trapped in their current job because they arent sure they could get implicitly subsidized health insurance if they moved .Does the reverse notch plus job lock mean that the CBOs estimate of work reduction ( NOT job loss ) actually represents a gain in welfare ? It might or might not  the traditional tradeoffs surely apply to many workers too . But you dont want to assume that its obviously a bad thing . Health reform isnt an intervention in a previously undistorted economy ; you might say that it replaces one set of distortions with a different set of distortions .And the one thing that remains clear is that it will be a big plus for the people who most need help ."

1	"By now , Im sure youre asking yourself : If the Republicans take control of the Senate in next weeks elections , what would it mean to me ?Excellent question !Well get things done , and it means a stop to the Obama agenda ,  said the embattled Senator Pat Roberts , Republican of Kansas . Did you notice that get things done is immediately followed by stop ?  What do you think that means ?Well , we know that if the Republicans win the majority , all Senate committees would have Republican chairs . The Energy Committee , for instance , might be run by Lisa Murkowski of Alaska , a moderate who is in the pocket of oil and gas lobbies . This would be a dramatic change from the current situation in which the Energy Committee is run by Mary Landrieu of Louisiana , a moderate who is in the pocket of oil and gas lobbies .On a far more exciting note , the Environment Committee could wind up being led by James Inhofe , the author of The Greatest Hoax : How the Global Warming Conspiracy Threatens Your Future.Under the Republicans , the Senate would be an extremely open body , in which the minority party would be permitted  nay , welcomed  to submit clever amendments designed to make the majority take difficult or embarrassing votes that could be used against them in the next election . The minority leader , Mitch McConnell , has complained about the Democrats heavy-handedness on this for years and will undoubtedly be eager to change things if he gets in control .And what about substance ? Republican voters would have every reason to expect that the first item on McConnells agenda would be repeal of Obamacare . But many Republican senators have positions on the Affordable Care Act that are nuanced in the extreme . Get rid of the program but keep the part about people with pre-existing conditions . Or the bit that lets young adults stay on their parents policies . McConnell himself has said that he wants to let his home state of Kentucky keep its extremely popular version of the program , which is known as Kynect . ( The website can continue , but in my view the best interests of the country would be achieved by pulling out Obamacare root and branch. )We look forward to seeing that legislation .Cynical minds might presume that , with a Republican majority , the Senate would simply continue in its current state of dysfunction , working diligently on an agenda ( defund Planned Parenthood , strangle the Environmental Protection Agency in its crib ) that will die for lack of 60 votes . Democrats , meanwhile , would fall back in love with the filibuster .Or maybe not . Some people believe that the Republicans would be eager to prove that they really , actually , genuinely can get things done and would work with the White House on matters of common interest , like tax reform .Tax reform would probably mean lowering some rates and making up for the lost revenue by closing tax loopholes elsewhere . The House Ways and Means Committee did some work on that recently , and the committee chairman actually unveiled a plan . Then John Boehner made fun of him . The plan never came up for a vote . The chairman is retiring .There are a few matters in which a Republican Senate majority would make a critical difference . One is the budget . This is stupendously important , but since we may have to spend the next two years discussing fiscal cliffs and the rules of reconciliation , it doesnt seem fair to make us start early .Also , theres the matter of presidential nominations . Two words : Supreme Court ,  said Chuck Schumer , the third-ranking Senate Democrat . If they have the majority , they have far more say over whos the nominee.That could have an impact for decades to come . However , it presupposes that there will be a Supreme Court vacancy . On the plus side , the next two years will be a boom time for prayers for the good health of Ruth Bader Ginsburg .Presuming the current justices continue in good form , the Republicans could still block other presidential nominations and we would have to get used to government by acting-heads-of . But thats already pretty close to the norm . One Republican representative recently denounced President Obama for creating an Ebola czar instead of giving the job to the surgeon general , apparently unaware that we have had no surgeon general for more than a year , thanks to the National Rifle Associations opposition to the administrations nominee for the job .Tracked down by The Huffington Post , Representative Jason Chaffetz of Utah claimed he really did know the surgeon generals post was vacant , and that anybody from the office could still do the Ebola job . I know theres some confusion there , but I dont think I was confused ,  he said stoutly .See , Representative Jason Chaffetz is perfectly willing to live with an acting surgeon general . And maybe someone could talk Eric Holder into hanging around for a while longer ."
1	"CAMBRIDGE , Maryland  President Barack Obama sought on Friday to ease strains with his Democratic allies in the U.S. Congress , who are fearful they could face election consequences from the botched rollout of the president 's signature healthcare law known as `` Obamacare . ''Speaking to House of Representatives Democrats during their three-day retreat , Obama cited an increase in the number of people signing up for insurance coverage under Obamacare as evidence that the law 's implementation was going more smoothly after a troubled start .Republicans , who have denounced Obamacare as an unpopular disaster , have put the issue at the center of their strategy for November 's congressional elections .But Obama has touted the administration 's progress in ironing out the glitches . At the retreat , he predicted that the 2010 Affordable Care Act will be seen by Americans in five to 10 years as `` a monumental achievement . ''`` We now have well over 3.5 million people who have signed up and are getting insurance through the marketplaces for the first time , '' Obama said .All 435 House seats along with 36 of the 100 Senate seats are up for grabs in the elections .Republicans are expected to retain the House , which they now control 232-200 with three vacancies . They hope the Obamacare issue will help them seize control of the Senate , which Democrats hold 55-45 .The troubles with Obama 's healthcare law have weighed on the president 's popularity . His approval rating now stands at 43 percent , and Democrats worry that Americans ' concerns about the health law could cost them support in their districts .Traditionally , presidents have seen their party lose seats in congressional elections during their second terms , largely due to voter fatigue with incumbents .Since 1946 , when a president 's approval rating was below 50 percent in such elections , his party has lost on average 36 House seats , according to the Gallup polling firm . When it is above 50 percent , they lose on average 14 seats , Gallup said .The healthcare issue was an important topic at the Democratic gathering at a waterfront resort . Before Obama spoke , the Democrats heard during a closed session from Ari Goldmann , a 32-year-old independent contractor and waiter who lives in Washington .A Democratic aide said Goldmann told the lawmakers he was `` beyond thrilled '' when he was able to get health coverage under Obamacare after his insurance company told him it was canceling his plan .Democrats hope to circulate more such stories in the months ahead as they scramble to win public approval of Obamacare and boost their election prospects .At a closed-door portion of his meeting with Democrats , another party aide said Obama told the gathering that `` underlying policies in the ( healthcare ) program are working , but of course there are glitches . We are working through these things . ''Obama also discussed his legislative agenda for this year , including a push to raise the minimum wage and renew expired jobless benefits for nearly 2 million Americans .Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida , who chairs the Democratic National Committee , underscored her party 's support of the president 's efforts .She declined to say , however , if it will be enough for Democrats to somehow win back the House .`` We are not making predictions , '' Wasserman Schultz said . `` We are focused on making sure that when it comes to giving people opportunities to climb the ladders of the middle class , that voters understand that Democrats have their backs . ''Representative Joseph Crowley of New York made reference to the snowstorm in the area when he introduced Obama at Friday 's gathering . Crowley said it had been a `` marvelous two days despite the weather and the odds against us .

1	"CAMBRIDGE , Mass .  Remember the Affordable Care Act , the Obama administrations signature health care plan ? Of course you do : For four years , it was at the epicenter of a vicious partisan battle in the United States , the subject of town meetings , congressional debates and talk show vitriol , not to mention the target of more than 800,000 negative television ads that cost an estimated $ 450 million .Then there was the disastrous rollout in late 2013 , caused by computer glitches that cost the program precious credibility at a critical time .Thats what most people remember  which might explain why some Republicans seeking election next month are still running attack ads against the health care law . The problem with that narrative is the program is proving to be a success , and yet the health care initiative  arguably the most significant piece of social legislation in decades  is no longer a prominent part of the Democratic agenda .The program has turned a corner ,  said Anton Gunn , a former South Carolina state legislator and health care expert , now on a fellowship at the Institute of Politics at Harvard . According to government figures released in September , 7.3 million people had signed up and paid for health plans delivered by state and federal exchanges as of mid-August ; the total is more than 10 million if children on parental plans are included , according to Mr. Gunn .Not bad for a program that opponents argued would ruin small businesses , put families at risk , force citizens to drop existing insurance policies and generally destroy America with a lethal dose of European-style socialism .Never mind that most Europeans like their health care systems , and were typically horrified to learn that some 40 million Americans had no health insurance at all . The fact that the number of uninsured is now dropping should be good news not only for the United States itself , but also for its image in the world .Yet Democratic candidates are largely shying away from the issue in this election season , as described in a recent talk at Harvard by Amy Walter , an editor of the Cook Political Report , a nonpartisan group that analyzes campaigns . Democrats have calculated that they have nothing to gain by bringing it up . For one thing , most Americans are unaffected by the new plans because they are insured through their employer . For another , health insurance is the kind of complicated issue that gets little traction on the campaign trail .What does resonate in the Republican-leaning states is the word Obamacare , the informal if widely used name for the program that serves as a handy proxy for an increasingly unpopular president . This is where the ads have had their biggest effect . They dont like him , so they dont like it ,  said Mr. Gunn .But as the program picks up enrollees , even Obama-bashers are having to shift targets . Its not the focus of the G.O.P . anymore ,  Mr. Gunn said . Theyre onto other issues  ISIS , Ebola , which Im sure theyll figure out a way to blame Obama for.Already , some of the health programs fiercest opponents are turning themselves into pretzels over the issue . The Senate minority leader , Mitch McConnell , running for re-election in Kentucky , has argued that the best interest of the country would be achieved by pulling out Obamacare , root and branch ,  while at the same time , defending Kentuckys health insurance exchange , which has enrolled 500,000 people .Experts expect enrollment to climb to 13 million people after the second application period opens on Nov. 15 . They also predict that state lawmakers will start to see a political benefit to participating in a program that obliges states to expand Medicaid , the program that subsidizes health care for the poor , at the federal governments expense .Drew Altman , president of the Kaiser Family Foundation , recently wrote that the attraction of federal funds and the votes of the newly insured may gradually trump ideology ,  prompting the 23 states that initially refused to participate in the Medicaid expansion to opt in .Once were past the election season , we can start working on testimonials about Obamacare , calling people out on it ,  Mr. Gunn said . Until then , the programs supporters are staying mum ."
1	"CHARLESTON , South Carolina  South Carolina lawmakers failed to derail implementation of President Barack Obama 's signature health care law in the state when a measure was defeated in the Republican-controlled Senate .Last year , the state House passed a bill that nullified the law by calling for criminal penalties for anyone who sought to enforce it . Late Wednesday night , however , Senators voted 33-9 to defeat an amendment regarding the Affordable Care Act , commonly known as Obamacare .The amendment would have banned state agencies and employees from helping to carry out the health care law . It would have required healthcare navigators who help people sign up for health insurance to be licensed by the state .Republican supporters argued they wanted to prevent the federal government from `` commandeering '' state resources in order to make the law work .The effort was being followed closely by Republican lawmakers in other states looking for ways to defeat the health insurance legislation , which was passed in 2010 and survived legal challenges all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court .In striking down the measure , South Carolina Lt. Gov . Glenn McConnell , the Senate president and a Republican , cited procedural rules that required the Senate to follow the original House bill 's aim without adding new issues .Democratic Senator Bradley Hutto said efforts to nullify the law would invite a federal lawsuit against the state .`` Nullification is a concept that is legally dead . It 's fraught with issues , '' Hutto said .`` We 've been down that road before , '' Democratic Senator John Matthews Jr. said , referring to South Carolina 's nullification of federal laws in the years before the U.S. Civil War , whose first shots were fired in the state .`` It did n't work then and it 's not going to work now , '' he said .About six states have barred their employees from helping implement Obamacare , according to Richard Cauchi , the healthcare program director for the nonpartisan National Conference of State Legislatures . At least eight states , including two that support the healthcare reforms , have regulated navigators , he said .( Corrects to state House passed a bill , not an amendment , paragraph 2 )( Editing by Kevin Gray and Grant McCool )"
1	"CHARLESTON , South Carolina  South Carolina lawmakers say they have found a way to stop implementation of the U.S . Affordable Care Act in their state , an effort that could provide a template for other Republican-led legislatures looking to derail the federal program .The proposed measure would ban state agencies from helping carry out President Barack Obama 's signature healthcare reform law and prevent federal money flowing through state coffers from being spent on it , said Republican state Senator Tom Davis .The legislation would give South Carolina oversight of insurance rates offered through its federal exchange and require healthcare navigators , which help people sign up for the healthcare benefits , to be licensed by the state , said Davis , who chairs the committee drafting the measure .The state 's 2014 legislative session opens on Tuesday .`` Even though the federal government may pass a law , and even though that law may be constitutional , that does n't mean that the federal government can direct the state to spend state dollars to implement it , '' he said . `` States are n't simply political subdivisions of the federal government . ''Six states have barred their employees from helping implement the law known as Obamacare , said Richard Cauchi , healthcare program director for the nonpartisan National Conference of State Legislatures .At least eight states , including two that support the healthcare reforms , have regulated navigators , he added .The new laws are mostly legally untested , Cauchi said .`` Florida and Ohio have said : 'We will have nothing to do with this law ; we wo n't make it workable , ' '' he said . `` At what point does state inaction constitute interference with a federal law ? ''Last fall , a federal judge blocked Tennessee 's `` emergency rule , '' which would have fined healthcare navigators for helping people find insurance under the Affordable Care Act .In December , Georgia lawmakers said they would follow South Carolina 's lead this year in trying to prevent state agencies from taking part in Obamacare . With many legislatures convening this month , it is too soon to tell what other states will consider new obstacles to the law , Cauchi said .Last year , South Carolina 's House of Representatives passed legislation to nullify Obamacare , but Davis said that effort clearly would not have passed legal muster .The state senator said he believed the rewritten bill , which he expects to be taken up for debate in a few weeks , would have teeth .Opponents of the federal law are looking to South Carolina for a `` template , something that other states can follow , '' Davis said . `` It 's like we 're holding the fort until we can get people in Congress that can repeal or replace it . ''He said he expected Democratic opposition and would need almost every Senate Republican 's vote to stop a filibuster .Critics of the South Carolina measure said the new attack on the Affordable Care Act was political theater .`` It is going to hurt people being able to access the marketplace because some of the navigator teams will pull out , '' said Brett Bursey , director of the South Carolina Progressive Network , a nonprofit coalition of liberal groups .If the measure becomes law , it probably will face legal challenges from opponents , said Gibbs Knotts , chairman of the political science department at the College of Charleston .`` It 's blocking access to something provided by the federal government , '' Knotts said . `` There 's all sorts of unfunded ( federal ) mandates that the states have to play a role in .

1	"CHICAGO  Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana and two smaller insurers will delay implementing policies to stop poor HIV patients from paying for Obamacare plans with funds from the federal Ryan White HIV/AIDS assistance program .The decision , which the insurers revealed at a federal court hearing on Tuesday , prompted the judge to lift a temporary restraining order that forced them to delay the change in policy for 14 days .On Monday , Brian Jackson , chief judge of the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana , issued the order that would have compelled the companies to accept Ryan White funds to pay insurance premiums on behalf of HIV patients .HIV advocates called the ruling a victory because the companies will now continue to accept payments using federal funds until March 31 , three weeks after the date the temporary restraining order would have expired .`` This is an important first step in preserving critical health insurance coverage for low-income individuals living with HIV and in halting the deliberate insurance industry practice of discriminating against people with HIV in general , '' said Scott Schoettes , senior attorney and HIV Project Director at Lambda Legal . The nonprofit group brought the lawsuit on behalf of John East , a part-time worker in the hospitality industry , and other low-income Louisianans living with HIV .Jackson has scheduled a March 10 hearing for a preliminary injunction to require the insurers to continue accepting the payments for the duration of the litigation .The insurers named in the case are Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana , Vantage Health Plan and Louisiana Health Cooperative . They are among a small handful of insurance companies in Louisiana that sell healthcare policies under President Barack Obama 's healthcare law .Without an injunction , low-income individuals with HIV who elect to stay in one of the plans offered by the three insurers will need to pay their own healthcare premiums after March 31 .For more than two decades , poor people with HIV have used funds from the federal Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program to buy health insurance they could not otherwise afford .But earlier this month , Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana began rejecting Ryan White payments sent on behalf of HIV patients who had enrolled in one of its Obamacare plans . Subsequently , the two smaller insurers followed suit .The insurers told healthcare advocates that guidance issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , the lead Obamacare agency , prevented them from accepting third-party payments for the new health plans , even when the funds came from a government program .Earlier this month , the CMS said that guidance did not apply to the Ryan White program . The federal agency also said it is considering amending rules to require issuers to accept Ryan White payments .Louisiana Blue , which had planned to stop honoring Ryan White and other third-party payments for premiums as of March 1 , said in a statement on Tuesday it will hold off on that policy until March 31 .John Maginnis , a spokesman for Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana , said in a statement that extending the deadline `` gives people more time to shop for the right healthcare plan for themselves and their families in the Marketplace , including finding out whether they may be eligible for a subsidy , or tax credit , to help them pay the cost of their healthcare premiums . ''The company will honor all premium payments , including those received from third parties , such as the Ryan White program , through March 31 , Maginnis said .After that , individual policy holders will have to submit their monthly payments directly .`` We are working to let our individual policyholders know about this forthcoming requirement , giving them more time to prepare and shop for plans in the Marketplace while enrollment is still open , if they are eligible , '' he said .Insurance experts point out that once one carrier in a market institutes policies that drive away potentially high-cost customers such as people with HIV-AIDS , other carriers feel pressure to do the same for fear of being the only one to cover them , a situation called adverse selection .Earlier this month , Lambda Legal filed an administrative complaint with the Office of Civil Rights of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services , CMS 's parent agency , against Louisiana Blue , Vantage and Louisiana Health Cooperative , arguing that their refusal to accept Ryan White payments flouted a key provision of the ACA , namely its requirement that insurers accept any customer regardless of health status .( Reporting by Julie Steenhuysen in Chicago ; Additional reporting by Sharon Begley in New York ; Editing by Jan Paschal and Richard Chang )"
1	"CINCINNATI  Once again , Judge Jeffrey S. Sutton was the unpredictable man in the middle on a major national issue .The 2003 George W. Bush appointee who stunned some conservatives three years ago by ruling in favor of President Barack Obama 's health care overhaul also wrote the majority opinion Thursday in a 2-1 decision by the 6th U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals that upheld anti-gay marriage laws in Ohio , Michigan , Kentucky and Tennessee .Sutton wrote that such a major social change as redefining marriage should be decided through the political process , not the courts .He said it is better to have change `` in which the people , gay and straight alike , become the heroes of their own stories by meeting each other not as adversaries in a court system but as fellow citizens seeking to resolve a new social issue in a fair-minded way . ''The decision was at odds with rulings by four other federal appeals courts , creating a split that dramatically increases the likelihood the U.S. Supreme Court will take up the issue .The 54-year-old Ohio State University law school graduate has a reputation among lawyers and court-watchers as a thoughtful and thorough jurist whose conservatism does n't automatically mean conservative rulings .Sutton was the first Republican-appointed federal appeals court judge to give support to the Obama health care overhaul .`` By most accounts , he 's considered a conservative judge , yet he ruled against us in the Obamacare case , '' said Robert J. Muise , attorney for the American Freedom Law Center . `` I think it showed he 's a judge of integrity in the sense that he 's going to rule on the way he thinks the law is , not based on what somebody thinks he should rule . ''University of Richmond law professor Carl Tobias said Thursday 's ruling again shows Sutton `` tries to call them as he sees them , '' and demonstrates a belief that `` the voters and elected branches , rather than unelected judges , should make changes like marriage equality . ''During Aug. 6 arguments in Cincinnati , in which the panel heard six cases from four states in the biggest hearing of its kind on the issue , Sutton 's questions and comments made it apparent he would be the swing vote , if not which way he was headed .Judge Deborah Cook , also a George W. Bush appointee , appeared clearly in favor of the states ' arguments , while Judge Martha Craig Daugherty , appointed by Democratic President Bill Clinton , insisted that it is right for the courts to intervene when people are being deprived of their constitutional right to equal treatment .Some of Sutton 's questions signaled his eventual ruling , as he asked attorneys for same-sex couples whether the courts are the best place for legalizing gay marriage .`` I would have thought the best way to get respect and dignity is through the democratic process , '' Sutton said during the arguments .Sutton expressed a similar philosophy in the 2011 health care ruling , concluding Congress had the right to require people to buy health insurance or face a penalty . He wrote that time would show the strengths and weaknesses of the mandate , `` allowing the people 's political representatives , rather than their judges , to have the primary say over its utility . ''Sutton , state solicitor for Ohio in the late 1990s when Republican George Voinovich was governor , got his bachelor 's degree from Williams College and his law degree in 1990 . He clerked for Supreme Court Justices Lewis Powell and Antonin Scalia . The conservative Scalia a few years ago called Sutton `` one of the very best law clerks I ever had . ''Bush nominated him to the federal bench in 2001 , but because of liberal opposition , he was n't confirmed until 2003 .California Sen. Dianne Feinstein , was one of only two Democrats to support his appointment to the appeals court , praising him as `` bright , well-qualified . ''`` I do n't think this man is going to be a biased judge , '' she said at the time .One of his former 6th Circuit clerks , Harvard Law School lecturer Leah Litman , said Sutton was tireless in working out his opinions , spending countless hours reading old rulings and seeking feedback from clerks and colleagues on arguments and counter-arguments .`` He really is everything you would want a judge to be , '' she said . `` He made me believe in the law .

1	"COLUMBUS , Ohio  The pitch for health care coverage is being made at nail salons , pizzerias , mosques and even bars .As the second enrollment period under President Barack Obama 's health care law begins , advocates are employing new tactics and expanding old ones to reach people who need insurance . Some groups are targeting populations they believe slipped through the cracks during the last enrollment period .`` We 've had great success at laundromats , '' said Robin Stockton , the navigator program director for the Center for Family Services , a nonprofit based in Camden , New Jersey .The informal chat between wash-and-dry cycles can pique interest and lead some customers to call their hotline for more information , she said .`` Typically , '' she said , `` the question you get back is : 'Is this that Obamacare thing ? ' ''Open enrollment started Saturday and runs until Feb. 15 . The HealthCare.gov website , where people can sign up and search for coverage , appeared to be running smoothly Saturday .Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia M. Burwell tweeted that the website opened shortly after 1 a.m. , with more than 23,000 people submitting applications within the first eight hours . She said 1.2 million unique visitors looked at coverage using the site 's window-shopping tool in the last week .In Washington state , though , the health care exchange shut down after the first few hours of open enrollment as state officials and software engineers tried to resolve a problem with tax credit calculations .And just days before open enrollment , an old video clip surfaced showing an adviser who helped draft the law saying `` the stupidity of the American voter '' helped Democrats pass the complex legislation . Obama , just before leaving an economic summit in Australia on Sunday , said the public was not misled about provisions of the law . He said there was no provision that was not extensively debated or made fully transparent .The Obama administration aims to have 9.1 million paying customers enrolled in 2015 . That 's well below the 13 million that the Congressional Budget Office had projected .In Philadelphia , Enroll America organizer Neil Rickett is armed with a list of 500 bars and restaurants as he makes his way through downtown , popping in and out of eateries . He approaches bartenders , wait staff and other service industry workers whose high turnover and odd hours often result in a lack of health coverage . He gets workers ' contact information and sometimes schedules appointments to meet with them .`` By going to them , we 're upping our chance of getting the people we missed or did n't get enrolled last time , '' Rickett said .In New Jersey , Stockton 's nonprofit is among the community-based groups guiding people through the enrollment process . When they are n't taking appointments , the 17 navigators take their enrollment message on the road .The helpers set up tables of brochures at festivals and malls . They make cold calls to pizza parlors , Chinese restaurants and other small businesses where they sometimes post information on bulletin boards . And with encrypted tablets and mobile offices , they have signed people up for coverage at churches , synagogues , mosques and a Buddhist temple .`` We 're very flexible about the times that we can go out and make it convenient , '' Stockton said .The organization 's contact information in a newspaper caught the attention of freelance writer Susan Van Dongen Grigsby , who has COBRA coverage through her husband 's former employer , though it expires next year .`` I do n't want to find myself without any coverage a few months from now , '' said Van Dongen Grigsby , 55 , of Bordentown , New Jersey .Changing insurance has been on her mind since her husband retired in 2012 . She pays $ 689 a month and hopes to find a cheaper plan . She said that she resisted the marketplace last year because she liked her COBRA coverage and that hearing horror stories about the website did n't help .`` I just would like someone walk to me through it and see what the options are , '' said Van Dongen Grigsby , who has an appointment this month with Stockton 's group .One organization in northeast Ohio plans to host information sessions with salon owners and their employees to help enroll Asian-Americans in coverage .Cathy Vue , an assistant manager of Asian Services in Action Inc. , said the organization also is putting together a free calendar for Asian groups that will include Affordable Care Act information in their native language . Each page of the 12-month calendar will feature a picture of a community member  Nepali , Korean , Hmong , Burmese  wearing native clothing .`` This is kind of a way that we 're hoping will get the community involved , '' Vue said . `` A lot of times they feel invisible so to have that visibility , I think , is really powerful . ''Word of mouth from a client led personal trainer Arthur Hunter to seek enrollment help from The Voice of Your Customer , a minority-owned business in Cincinnati that has counselors assisting with sign-ups . Hunter has health insurance through his wife 's employer , though the two are getting a divorce . He hoped to get his coverage lined up Saturday .`` I do n't want to have a day go by without having it , '' said Hunter , 47 . `` Health and fitness is so important to me  that for me , one of the most important things is to have that health care coverage . ''Anne Filipic , president of Enroll America , said reaching the uninsured naturally will get harder from year to year as more people get coverage . Part of the challenge this period , she said , is for organizers not just to connect people to health insurance but also to make sure those enrolled keep their coverage and make any necessary updates .`` This year , we really have to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time , '' Filipic said .___Associated Press writer Sean Carlin in Philadelphia contributed to this report ."
1	"COLUMBUS Ohio ( Reuters ) - In the struggle within the Republican Party between the conservative Tea Party flank and moderates , Ohio Governor John Kasich is seeking to position himself as someone who can appeal to both sides .Kasich , a potential 2016 presidential contender , touts his zeal for tax cuts and balanced budgets . But he also says the Republican Party should be run from the bottom up , rather than the top down ,  and do more to help the poor , mentally ill and incarcerated .I think our actions have to reflect our rhetoric ,  Kasich told Reuters in an interview as he campaigned for Republican candidates in the industrial city of Youngstown ahead of Tuesday 's midterm elections . So when we say were a party of opportunity , there should be ( opportunity ) ,  he said , adding that in Ohio , Republicans will leave no one behind.His message is an updated version of former President George W. Bush 's mantra of `` compassionate conservative . '' It is unclear if it would resonate well enough with Republican voters and donors to make Kasich a serious contender for the partys presidential nomination .But in Ohio , a presidential battleground state , voters seem receptive . Polls show that in Kasich 's campaign to retain the governor 's office , he has a double-digit lead over Democratic challenger Ed FitzGerald ahead of Tuesdays vote .When asked if he will seek the presidency , Kasich insisted he is focused on being governor . But he made clear he believes Ohios brand of Republicanism could play well nationally .Im hopeful that the things we are doing in the state will influence some of the strains of the Republican Party ,  he said , referring to differing currents within the party .During a three-day bus tour last week , Kasich emphasized caring for people with addictions , assisting the disabled and reducing offender recidivism .Republican candidates on the tour made stops on Thursday at a factory in rural Richland County , a family-owned deli west of Cleveland , a church in an Akron suburb and an air compressor distributor in the Democratic stronghold of Youngstown .At Dearing Compressor and Pump Co. , which has grappled with years of layoffs at auto and steel plants , Kasich told workers of his upbringing outside Pittsburgh by parents who were Democrats , suggesting his brand of Republican policies can work for Democrats too .In 1980 , my dad thought about the country ... he voted for Ronald Reagan , lots of Democrats did ,  Kasich said to the subdued but polite crowd .OHIO SUCCESSES COULD BE SPRINGBOARDKasich , 62 , is a former U.S. congressman who won a tight race for governor against incumbent Democrat Ted Strickland in 2010 . After leaving the U.S. House of Representatives in 2001 he worked for the investment bank Lehman Brothers until its 2008 bankruptcy , a role highlighted by Strickland during the 2010 campaign . As he was leaving the House , he briefly explored a White House bid but had difficulty raising money .Kasich at times speaks in an offhanded manner . Shortly after being elected governor , he said to a group of state environmental workers that a police officer who ticketed him was an idiot ,  angering the law enforcement officers union . A spokesman apologized for his word choice and Kasich later met with the officer and apologized to him in person .Public employees unions are still smarting over a Kasich-backed law early in his tenure to curb collective bargaining . Voters repealed the measure and Kasich opted to move onto other issues .Kasich often cites how Ohio has built up nearly $ 1.5 billion in savings in its Rainy Day Fund ,  how the state 's unemployment rate is 5.6 percent , below the 5.9 percent nationwide unemployment rate , and how its credit rating has improved . The figures would support his image as a fiscal conservative during a White House bid .A new health office has allowed Ohio to reduce Medicaid spending , even while extending coverage to hundreds of thousands of additional low-income residents under the President Barack Obama 's Affordable Care Act .Kasich moved ahead with Medicaid expansion despite opposition from the Republican-controlled legislature . Many other Republican governors opted out of the expansion , an element of Obamacare . If Kasich decides to run for president , that could be heavy baggage in a primary , given the antipathy toward the law among Tea Party voters .Strategists say Kasich would have to play to the middle to be a viable White House contender . Texas Senator Ted Cruz and Kentucky Senator Rand Paul would draw grassroots support from the partys conservative and libertarian wings .But the middle could be crowded . Potential candidates such as New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush are far better known nationally than Kasich and might amass campaign cash more easily .( Reporting By Amanda Becker ; Additional reporting by Gabriel Debenedetti in Washington ; Editing by Caren Bohan and Frances Kerry )"
1	"CONWAY , Ark .  Former President Bill Clinton urged voters in his home state Monday not to use the midterm election as a protest against the White House , as he toured the state to help Democrats ' efforts to prevent a GOP takeover in Arkansas .Clinton kicked off a series of rallies in Arkansas on Monday , praising Democratic candidates in close races for U.S. Senate , House and governor as people willing to work with both parties for the good of the state . He also criticized Republicans ' efforts to tie Democrats to President Barack Obama , who lost Arkansas in the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections and remains deeply unpopular in the state .`` They want you to make this a protest vote , '' Clinton told a crowd gathered at the University of Central Arkansas campus . `` All three of these races , they 're saying 'you may like these guys , but hey , you know what you 've got to do . You 've got to vote against the president . After all , it 's your last shot . ' ''Clinton appeared with Democratic U.S. Sen. Mark Pryor , who is locked in a tight and expensive fight for a third term against Republican U.S. Rep. Tom Cotton . The race could decide which party controls the U.S. Senate next year . Former North Little Rock Mayor Pat Hays , who is running for a central Arkansas congressional seat , and gubernatorial nominee and former U.S. Rep. Mike Ross , also shared the stage with Clinton .Noting that the president only has two years left on his term , Clinton added : `` It 's a pretty good scam is n't it ? Give me a six year job for a two-year protest . That 's Mark Pryor 's opponent 's message . ''Clinton 's visit comes as Republicans in Arkansas and other key states are seizing on the president 's recent remarks that though he 's not on the ballot , his policies are . A spokesman for Cotton cited those remarks as he downplayed Clinton 's visit and continued trying to paint Pryor as too closely aligned with Obama .`` We 're not bothered by President Clinton 's support of Senator Pryor , '' Cotton spokesman David Ray said in an email . `` What bothers us , and should bother all Arkansans , is Senator Pryor 's lock-step support of President Obama 's agenda , which he has supported 93 percent of the time -- including on Obamacare , the failed stimulus bill , the Wall Street bailout , judicial nominees -- you name it . ''Pryor , the only Democrat in the state 's federal delegation , accused Cotton of representing out-of-state groups more than the voters  a common theme during his re-election bid .`` He has his billionaires , but you know what I have ? I have you , '' Pryor said . `` I have the people of this state and that 's how we win this race . ''Clinton remains a beloved figure in Arkansas , where his presidential library is located and where the Little Rock airport is named for him and former first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton .He also boasts longstanding ties with the state 's top candidates this year . Pryor 's father , David , is a former governor and U.S. senator who was Clinton 's mentor . Ross got his start in politics driving Clinton around the state during the 1982 gubernatorial campaign . Hays is a longtime friend and supporter of Clintons .And James Lee Witt , who headed the Federal Emergency Management Agency under Clinton , is running for the south Arkansas congressional seat Cotton now holds .Clinton 's visit comes after a string of high-profile Republican surrogates campaigned in the state , including former Florida Gov . Jeb Bush and former presidential nominee Mitt Romney . The visits were designed in part to highlight the president 's unpopularity in Arkansas .Clinton also used his speech to praise Democratic Gov . Mike Beebe , who has remained popular in the state despite Republicans ' recent gains , and compared the state 's top candidates to him .Clinton also planned to headline a rally in Jonesboro on Monday , and two more in northwest Arkansas on Tuesday . The tour kicked off on the deadline to register to vote for the Nov. 4 election , and two weeks before early voting begins .`` Every vote counts , '' Beebe said . `` A big turnout means these folks win .

1	"Casey B. Mulligan is an economics professor at the University of Chicago . He is the author of The Redistribution Recession : How Labor Market Distortions Contracted the Economy.From a tax perspective , the Affordable Care Act is in a different league than the Massachusetts health reform law passed in 2006 .The federal government and other advocates of Obamacare have dismissed concerns that the coming labor market contraction would be significant , or even noticeable , by pointing to Massachusettss experience with its so-called Romneycare system , also designed to expand insurance coverage . Because the Massachusetts labor market did not noticeably contract relative to the rest of the nation after its system went into effect , an official of the federal Department of Health and Human Services told The Washington Examiner that the experience in Massachusetts suggested that the health care law will improve the affordability and accessibility of health care without significantly affecting the labor market.Prof. David Cutler of Harvard recently addressed , on this blog , concerns about possibly adverse tax effects , saying , Additional data from Massachusetts , where a state law was the precursor to the Affordable Care Act , suggests that the fears are overblown and at this point the evidence overwhelmingly suggests no need for major worry. This position assumes that the Massachusetts system increased marginal labor income tax rates in the state by roughly the same magnitude that the Affordable Care Act will increase them in the United States ( by marginal labor income tax rate , I mean the extra taxes paid , and subsidies forgone , as the result of working , expressed as a ratio to the total compensation from working ) . This assumption is no longer necessary , because the methods I have used to measure marginal tax rates from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 , unemployment insurance expansions and the Affordable Care Act can also be applied to the Massachusetts health reform law . The results are shown in the chart below .The left bar shows that the Massachusetts law did , on average , increase marginal tax rates and thereby reduce the reward to working . But the impact was well under one percentage point , and for that reason its probably not surprising that , relative to other states that were not experiencing health reform , the Massachusetts labor market did not change noticeably after the law went into effect .The right bar shows the impact of the Affordable Care Act on nationwide marginal tax rates : it increases national rates about 12 times as much as the Massachusetts law increased rates . Earlier this year I explained why the Massachusetts law was so different from a tax perspective : among other things , its employer penalty is an order of magnitude less , the states population is not the same as the national population , and Massachusetts had already been helping unemployed people with health insurance .It follows that the effect of the Affordable Care Act on employment and work hours would be roughly 12 times as great as the effect of the Massachusetts law . That doesnt by itself tell us the exact impact of the national law because we dont have a precise estimate of the impact in Massachusetts , except that it was small . For example , if the Massachusetts law reduced employment by 0.1 percent , the Affordable Care Acts effect would be roughly 1.2 percent ; not small . If the Massachusetts laws effect were 0.25 percent ( still small ) , the Affordable Care Acts effect would be 3 percent : again , not small . The bottom line was that it was wrong to expect the two laws to have had the same effects .Call me gloomy , but Im one economist who thinks that adding , on average , five percentage points to marginal tax rates will noticeably depress the labor market , while adding a few tenths of a point in Massachusetts did not ."

This is all about spending taxpayer money , and the question is whether that money should be spent directly to help people or run through a set of private middlemen .And despite some feeble claims to the contrary , privatizing Medicaid will end up requiring more , not less , government spending , because theres overwhelming evidence that Medicaid is much cheaper than private insurance .

The answer is , raw political power . Letting the medical-industrial complex continue to get away with a lot of overcharging was , in effect , a price President Obama had to pay to get health reform passed . And since the reward was that tens of millions more Americans would gain insurance , it was a price worth paying .But why would you insist on privatizing a health program that is already public , and that does a much better job than the private sector of controlling costs ? The answer is pretty obvious : the flip side of higher taxpayer costs is higher medical-industry profits .So ignore all the talk about too much government spending and too much aid to moochers who dont deserve it .

Lynn Westmoreland ( @ RepWestmoreland ) 1 Oct 14The Obama administration said last week that HealthCare.gov was being redesigned so that 70 percent of consumers would be able to use shorter and simpler application forms . So far , 7.3 million people have bought private insurance through the exchanges , have paid their premiums and are still enrolled in the program ."
1	"DALLAS  Senator Ted Cruz , after two days of bedevilment over his birthplace and eligibility for the presidency , returned to form on Tuesday night with a rally here before the conservative faithful aimed at ginning up support to defund President Obamas health care overhaul .Youre here because now is the single best time we have to defund Obamacare ,  Mr. Cruz said to raucous applause at a cavernous ballroom at the Hilton Anatole hotel . This is a fight we can win.The event was part of Heritage Action for Americas Defund Obamacare tour , which began Monday in Fayetteville , Ark. , and will make stops in nine cities . But Mr. Cruz is only appearing at the Dallas rally , and he drew a standing ovation from a crowd of roughly a thousand people .The tour is timed to the expiration at the end of September of the continuing resolution that finances the government , and Mr. Cruz said Tuesday night that he would call on House members to approve every penny of the federal government , everything in its entirety , except Obamacare.What has to happen after that is weve got to do something that conservatives havent done in a long time ,  he said . Weve got to stand up and win the argument.Speaking to reporters before the rally , Mr. Cruz , a Republican and the junior senator from Texas , said he did not want to shut down the government  I want to defund Obamacare.Jim DeMint , a former senator from South Carolina who is now the president of the Heritage Foundation , speaking to reporters before the event , echoed Mr. Cruzs basic message . This could be one of the most destructive laws that has ever been imposed on the American people , and now is probably the last best chance we have to actually stop it ,  he said .He praised Mr. Cruz for taking the lead in the fight , even when victory was hardly assured .All you have to do is mention Ted Cruzs name in any forum   we did last night in Fayetteville   and the crowd is on their feet cheering , because they dont necessarily expect him to win , but they do appreciate someone willing to stand up to the status quo in Washington to do what he promised ,  Mr. DeMint said .Mr. Cruz was interrupted several times by angry protesters , but he was unfazed , saying that he would be happy to visit with them later .He closed his remarks by reappropriating Mr. Obamas signature campaign refrain of Yes We Can.Can we stop the I.R.S . ?  he asked . Can we mobilize grass-roots America ? And can we defund Obamacare ? Yes , we can !  came the eager reply , before Mr. Cruz concluded , That , my friends , is change we can believe in.But even in Dallas , Mr. Cruz could not escape questions stemming from a report in The Dallas Morning News on Monday that because he was born in Calgary , Alberta , he held both Canadian and American citizenship . He was forced before the rally to reiterate to reporters eager to discuss the matter that he had been an American since birth.On Monday , Mr. Cruz  the child of an American mother and a Cuban-born father who moved to Texas from Canada when he was 4  renounced his Canadian citizenship . Nothing against Canada ,  he said . But as a United States senator , he added , I believe I should be only an American.It may not be quite the same as printing up signs or fashioning a presidential campaign Web site , but the announcement was widely seen by analysts as another step leading to his entry in the 2016 Republican primary race .It is a novel episode in the annals of presidential politics . Looming over his prospects are questions about his eligibility to run , given his place of birth .Mr. Cruz , 42 , maintains that because his mother was born in Delaware , he is a natural-born citizen and has the constitutional right to serve as president , and few legal scholars believe his eligibility could be seriously challenged in court . But the issue has been raised before .Senator John McCain , Republican of Arizona , was born in the Panama Canal Zone to American parents and faced a few questions about his birthplace when he was his partys presidential nominee in 2008 .But it is because of Mr. Obama that Mr. Cruz is confronting not just a constitutional issue but also a political one .Suspicions about Mr. Obamas background have long flourished on the fringes of American politics , so much so that the so-called birthers who doubt he was born in Hawaii led the president to release his birth certificate in 2011 .Mr. Cruz , wanting to pre-empt any such questions about his own origins , released his own birth certificate  dated Dec. 22 , 1970 .Mr. Cruz may have had another motivation in releasing his birth certificate and renouncing his foreign ties : Canada is not particularly beloved by American conservatives .National Review , the conservative magazine , memorably ran a cover in 2007 depicting a group of Mounties with the headline Wimps !  The article inside complained about the countrys whiny and weak anti-Americanism."
1	"DALLAS  Republican Sen. Ted Cruz sounds increasingly like he 's made up his mind to run for president in 2016 , telling an influential gathering of conservative activists Saturday that `` we are part of a grassroots fire that is sweeping this country . ''`` I 'm convinced we 're going to win in 2014 , and 2016 is going to be even better , '' the Texas Republican said during a summit of Americans for Prosperity , the political arm of the billionaire GOP donors Charles and David Koch . `` And in the year 2017 , a Republican president in the Rose Garden is going to sign a bill repealing every word of Obamacare . ''Cruz joked about inviting President Barack Obama to the border to see where thousands of unaccompanied immigrant children have poured into the U.S . The president declined such an invitation from Texas Gov . Rick Perry .`` I figured out the only way there is a chance in heaven he might come , I 'm inviting him to come to a golf course , '' Cruz said .Cruz offered a way to deal with Islamic State militants in Iraq . `` ISIS says they want to go back and reject modernity , '' he said . `` Well , I think we should help them . We ought to bomb them back to the stone age . ''When the crowd of more than 3,000 at a hotel ballroom serenaded him with calls of `` Run Ted , Run ! '' he offered a quip : `` Oddly enough , that 's the same thing my wife , Heidi , says to me when I go to the gym . ''Cruz ignored direct questions about a presidential campaign when he met with reporters after the speech .He told the conservatives , `` Each of you are here because we are part of a grassroots fire that is sweeping this country '' and added : `` We are building an army . ''Two other possible 2016 presidential hopefuls , Perry and Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky , spoke to the summit on Friday ."
1	"DENVER  Republican congressman Cory Gardner defeated the Democratic incumbent in Colorado 's U.S. Senate race on Tuesday , handing Republicans a big win in a swing state where the Democratic governor was also narrowly trailing his challenger .Senator Mark Udall 's re-election had looked fairly safe until February , when Gardner , 40 , said he was leaving a secure seat in the U.S. House of Representatives to take on the first-term senator .`` We won this election because we asked Coloradans ... to look ahead to a future that is brighter , '' Gardner told jubilant supporters at Republican campaign headquarters .`` We can fix this nation 's problems together . ... What is happening in Washington is n't working and it has to stop . ''Democrats said their Republican rivals made Colorado `` Ground Zero '' in their battle for the U.S. Senate , and the 64-year-old Udall was seen as vulnerable because of his support for the Affordable Care Act , or Obamacare , which was highly unpopular in the state .As Republican supporters cheered when it became clear the party would win control of the U.S. Senate on Tuesday night , fire marshals had to ask some revelers to leave , saying the room at a suburban Denver hotel was too crowded .With 83 percent of precincts reporting , Gardner had 50.6 percent of the vote to Udall 's 44 percent , according to the state 's flagship newspaper , the Denver Post . The son of a tractor salesman from a conservative eastern Colorado farming district , Gardner won the newspaper 's endorsement last month .Udall , whose father once sought the Democratic presidential nomination and whose cousin is a Democratic senator from New Mexico , had followed a successful strategy used by Colorado Democrats in the past by putting women 's issues front and center .But his bid to paint Gardner as an extremist on abortion appeared to have backfired , with the Post calling it an `` obnoxious one-issue campaign '' that insulted voters .Udall said in a concession speech that serving in the Senate had been `` the greatest privilege of my life . ''Governor John Hickenlooper , a former Denver mayor and brew-pub magnate who has been spoken of as a possible Democratic vice presidential candidate in 2016 , was fighting to fend off a challenge from former Republican U.S. Representative Bob Beauprez .With 86 percent of precincts reporting , Beauprez led with 48.0 percent of votes to Hickenlooper 's 47.5 percent .Both candidates urged supporters to go home and get some rest as a trickle of results showed the governor narrowing the gap with his rival to just a few thousand votes .`` Do not lose heart . Get a little sleep , '' Hickenlooper said .The governor , who ran for a second term on Colorado 's strong economic performance under his watch , has faced controversies over a proposed school reform tax increase and stricter gun laws introduced after a movie theater shooting in a Denver suburb and the Sandy Hook school shooting in Connecticut .Beauprez , who lost a governor 's race eight years ago , has also criticized Hickenlooper 's backing for a renewable energy mandate , as well as a failed $ 950 million tax hike for education reform proposed by the state 's Democratic-led Legislature .( Additional reporting by Rick Wilking in Denver , and Anna Yukhananov and Susan Cornwell in Washington ; Editing by Doina Chiacu , Eric Walsh , Peter Cooney and Ken Wills )"
1	"DENVER  Republicans posted sweeping gains in state houses across the nation on Tuesday , taking control of the most state legislatures in nearly 100 years and approaching a record number of governors seats  a critical development at a time when most major policy has been coming out of states , rather than Washington .With final tallies still being compiled , the Republicans now control both houses of the legislatures of 29 states , the highest number since 1920 . By contrast , Democrats now control both chambers in just 11 states . The Republicans netted at least two governors seats  while holding off strong challenges from Democrats in places like Wisconsin and Florida  leaving the party with at least 31 governorships , the highest since 1998 .It was a worst-case scenario for the Democrats ,  said Tim Storey , an elections analyst at the National Conference of State Legislatures . Republican voters turned out better , were more enthusiastic , they just swamped the Democrats . The anti-Obama mood was too strong even for many Democratic candidates who were well funded and had run equally active campaigns . In the state legislatures , the Democrats were overwhelmed by the environment.With the states acting as laboratories for legislation that can not advance in Washington , policy changes are likely on a variety of issues . What theyre going to do now is move forward a Republican set of policies  lower taxes and a focus on job creation ,  Mr. Storey said . It will be much harder to see expansions of Medicaid . And there may be fewer restrictions for gun owners.The results suggested a backlash by voters to what had been a record-high number of states under the full control of a single party , at least when it came to Democrats . Going into the election , Democrats held both houses of the Legislature and the governors seat in 13 states ; that number has been reduced to seven , though a few legislative races are still being tallied .`` The voters have asked for divided government ,  said Bruce Rauner , the Republican governor-elect in Illinois  Mr. Obamas home state , where Democrats had held sole control of the state capital for more than a decade . For the first time in many years , well have a Republican governor and a Democratic legislature.In Minnesota , Gov . Mark Dayton , a Democrat , was re-elected , but Republicans took control of the state House , ending the Democrats two years of full control of the state capital . I think what we probably learned is that Minnesotans believe that the Democrats overreached in the last two years  on taxes , on spending , and in other areas ,  said Kurt Daudt , who had been the Republicans minority leader in the House .Republicans lost the governors seat in Pennsylvania , a state that had been under single-party control before Tuesday . But they put two more states under their single-party rule . Republicans seized both houses in Nevada , the home state of Senator Harry Reid , the Senate Democratic leader , and a place that Democrats have viewed as moving in their direction . Brian Sandoval , the Republican governor , was easily re-elected . They also won the governorship in Arkansas , putting that state into the single-party control category .Republicans will go into next year holding full party control in at least 23 states , the same as this year , though they could end up with 24 , depending on whether they continue holding Alaska , where votes were still being tallied in the governors race . A rare bright spot for Democrats on an otherwise bleak night was that they kept Republicans from taking over chambers in Kentucky and Iowa .Republicans hailed the results as evidence of public support of an agenda , played out in states like Wisconsin , that included scaling back union pension plans and the political power of unions and trying to combat President Obamas health care plan .Obamacare was a big driver in many of these races ,  said Phil Cox , the executive director of the Republican Governors Association . And thats certainly going to be on the table.On Tuesday afternoon , Pat Hickey , who has been the Republican minority leader in the Nevada Assembly , said his party now had a historic opportunity as well as challenge to be able to implement some of the reforms and remedies that weve argued for many sessions , if not decades.Mr. Hickey said the newly Republican-held capital might tackle education issues and a restructuring of the state tax system , as well as examine collective bargaining rules and pensions . All of these things will be on the table ,  he said .In Minnesota , where Republicans took control of the state House , Paul Thissen , a Democrat who will no longer be speaker , said he expected the change would stall hopes Democrats had for the coming year , including the possibility of more spending on transportation and efforts to expand worker protections like paid parental leave .In another measure of the shift in power , Republicans are poised to control 67 to 69 legislative chambers , up from 59 before the election , according to officials in both parties .Matthew Walters , the president of the Republican State Leadership Committee , said that the historic high for legislative seats held by Republicans was 4,001 in 1928 , and that the high for chambers controlled was 64 in 1920 . We are confident that once all the final recounts are done , that we will be at a new all-time Republican high for chambers and a new all-time high of Republican seats in state legislatures ,  he said .The showing in some ways echoed the Republican victories in the last midterm elections in 2010 , when Republicans also made significant gains in state houses . But Michael Sargeant , the executive director of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee , a group that tries to elect Democrats to state legislatures , said he was confident that the party would pick up many of the seats it lost in the 2016 presidential election , which is what happened in 2012 .Dont take this as if we were joyous ,  he said . We are not at all . But we thought this could have been worse . We held the Iowa Senate . We held the Maine House . Those were big targets for Republicans.In one sense , the Republican victories in state houses may prove to be less consequential than the ones of 2010 ; those legislatures were the ones that drew district lines as part of the nations reapportionment process , giving the party what has proved to be a big advantage in Congressional and some statehouse races that could last through 2020 ."
1	"DENVER  What was once a `` fly-over '' Senate race in Colorado has become one of the nation 's most closely watched contests , with a young Republican congressman who is leaving a safe seat in the U.S. House fiercely attacking Democratic incumbent Mark Udall .As mail-in ballots headed to post boxes across the state this week , Udall 's path to re-election appeared steeper after he failed to win the endorsement of the state 's flagship newspaper . Polls show a race that 's too close to call .`` It 's a toss-up . ... There 's no one single issue that defines the race , '' said Floyd Ciruli , a Denver-based independent pollster , adding that various polls show each candidate with a slight lead .A poll by SurveyUSA and the Denver Post released on Monday showed U.S. Representative Cory Gardner ahead of Udall , 45 percent to 43 percent .Democrats say Republicans have made politically purple Colorado ground zero in next month 's general election as they seek to wrest control of the U.S. Senate from Democrats .Udall , 64 , is seen as potentially vulnerable because of his support for the Affordable Care Act , known as Obamacare , and because his 40-year-old rival has strong name recognition .In a bombshell editorial on Friday , the traditionally liberal Denver Post backed Gardner , though it lauded Udall as `` a fine man with good intentions . ''It said Udall was not seen as a leader in Washington and complained his team spent a `` shocking amount of energy and money '' unfairly trying to persuade voters that Gardner wants to outlaw birth control .`` His obnoxious one-issue campaign is an insult to those he seeks to convince , '' the newspaper said .Udall , who is running for a second term , has followed a well-trod tactic of Colorado Democrats by putting women 's issues front and center . At a candidates ' debate last week , one of the moderators noted that some pundits have dubbed him `` Mark Uterus . ''`` If Congressman Gardner had n't built his entire political career on limiting women 's reproductive choices , we would n't be having this discussion today , '' Udall said , adding that more than half his ads have dealt with other issues .Gardner , who is campaigning as a moderate conservative , says it is outrageous to suggest he wants to ban birth control , including over-the-counter contraceptives .In the past , Gardner has backed `` personhood '' initiatives in Colorado , which defined a person as a human being from the point of conception . He says he has since changed his mind .TRACTOR SALESMAN 'S SONSo concerned are Democrats about Udall 's fate that President Barack Obama urged Colorado voters to consider the race as important as the 2008 presidential battle , in which Colorado helped put Obama in the White House .On Monday , former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton headlined a fundraiser for Udall in Denver , then posed for the cameras with the senator at the city 's newly refurbished Union Station .Democrats in the state can be vulnerable : Last year , voters recalled two Democratic state legislators who approved tighter gun laws introduced after shooting rampages there and in Connecticut . A third resigned after being targeted .Until early this year it appeared Udall would face a Tea Party favorite , Weld County District Attorney Ken Buck . But after Gardner , a two-term congressman , said he would give up his seat in February to mount a challenge , Buck bowed out , saying he would seek Gardner 's House seat . [ ID : nL1N0LW0I3 ]Gardner , who represented a conservative eastern Colorado farming district , is the son of a tractor salesman . His ads have hailed his co-sponsorship of a 2007 bill to help fund clean energy projects , though critics say the bill , which was repealed five years after passage , was badly worded and ineffective .His campaign has sounded increasingly confident since polls in September began showing him narrowly leading Udall .Gardner has mocked Udall for skipping a Denver fundraiser led by Obama in July ( Udall pleaded official duties in Washington ) . And in a much-talked-about TV spot , he took a jab at his rival 's influential family ties .`` He 's a nice guy who will never change the Senate , '' Gardner said . `` Eighteen years in politics , and he 's got two cousins who are senators too . ''Udall 's father , the late Morris `` Mo '' Udall , was a U.S. representative from Arizona who sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 1976 . A cousin , Tom Udall , is a Democratic senator from New Mexico , and a second cousin , Mike Lee , is a Republican senator from Utah .Figures released last week show Gardner out-raised Udall in the third quarter , $ 4.3 million to $ 4 million .`` Money is not the end-all , '' Ciruli said . `` But it does show that GOP donors think this is a winnable race .

1	"DES MOINES , Iowa  Republican Senate candidate Joni Ernst has canceled a meeting with The Des Moines Register 's editorial board , saying her time was better spent campaigning in Iowa .Editors at the newspaper said Ernst 's campaign notified them Wednesday night that she would n't attend the Thursday meeting . Publisher Rick Green said he was disappointed .`` Undecided voters I talk to want Sen. Ernst to break through the rhetoric and cacophony of campaign ads about hogs , Obamacare and balanced budgets . It 's a time for sharing specifics , '' Green said in a statement .Ernst , a state lawmaker and lieutenant colonel in the Iowa National Guard , is locked in a tight race against Democratic U.S. Rep. Bruce Braley . She said she was focused on talking to voters .`` I have got a tight schedule , '' Ernst said before a campaign event Thursday . `` What I need to do is really reach out to undecided voters . So we decided we 're going to drive on and get out to those counties and make sure I 'm connecting with actual people one on one . ''Ernst spokeswoman Gretchen Hamel issued a statement saying the Register 's recent editorials make the newspaper 's position `` perfectly clear . '' The paper , which endorsed Ernst in the five-way Republican primary , has run several editorial pieces criticizing Ernst 's policy positions .Ernst has met with editors at Nebraska 's Omaha World-Herald , whose readership extends into western Iowa , and at the Sioux City Journal . The Cedar Rapids Gazette endorsed Braley on Sunday and wrote that Ernst did not find time to meet with their editorial board . Editors in the Quad Cities and Dubuque said they have thus far unsuccessfully sought meetings .Hamel said the campaign may still find time for the other papers .Braley 's spokesman says the congressman has accepted all editorial board invitations ."

1	"Dana Milbank has an interesting piece today , on two levels .He begins:When will the criticism of Obamacare finally end ?Ive done some research on the question , and by my calculations , judging from current trends , this will happen approximately . . . never .He then goes on to compare Obamacare to the auto bailout , which at this point looks like a rousing success  but continues to be lambasted by the right , because it shouldnt have worked , and therefore cant have worked .Its a clever and apt comparison . But its something else , too : Milbank may be funny , but hes not Shrill ( TM ) . So when you see him asking how conservatives will react to Obamacares success , its a strong signal that the press is catching up to the reality that December is not October , and that the news  while there are still many troubles  is increasingly positive . Actually , so is Darrel Issas angry rebuke to a health care official : You need to watch more Fox News.One thing this says is that GOP expectations that Obamacares collapse will lead them to triumph are way off . More generally , current polling  which reflects press coverage over the past couple of months , not the months to comes  is probably a very bad guide to future attitudes ."
1	"Despite strong dislike of President Obamas handling of health care , a majority of people in three Southern states  Kentucky , Louisiana and North Carolina  would rather that Congress improve his signature health care law than repeal and replace it , according to a New York Times Upshot/Kaiser Family Foundation poll .The poll also found that a majority of Kentucky residents  and a plurality in a fourth state , Arkansas  said they thought the health care marketplace in their state was working well , even as they expressed strong disapproval of the health care law . More than twice as many Kentuckians say their state exchange is working well than say it is not .The findings in the four states  all with political races that could tip the balance of power in the Senate  underscore the complex and often contradictory views of Mr. Obamas principal domestic legislation four years after it became law .Most people still loathe the law . Questions about it may evoke associations with an unpopular president , the remoteness of Washington from ordinary Americans and extra costs in family budgets . But majorities say they do not want it taken away , even in states that lean Republican in presidential elections .And when it comes to how the law is working , people give it much higher marks in the state that runs its own exchange  Kentucky . Arkansas , which has a partnership exchange with the federal government , is also ranked more positively .One of the poll respondents , Bonnie Broome , who works as a project manager for AT & T in New Orleans , said that the law was cumbersome ,  but that it seemed here to stay . Im a Republican , but Im tired of them saying Repeal , repeal , repeal , '  Ms. Broome , 53 , said in a follow-up interview . They need to make it better.The poll also highlighted problems with the federal governments implementation of the law . In Louisiana and North Carolina , where the federal government operates the insurance marketplaces because state officials opted not to establish their own , people give them more negative marks .Well , I went on the Internet and tried and tried and tried to enroll , and it wouldnt let me through and I finally ended up calling ,  said Teddy Taylor , 45 , a truck driver in Wilkesboro , N.C .Debate over the law is expected to dominate the midterm elections . Attacks on the law are featuring prominently in campaigns across the country , and Republican lawmakers have continued to push for the laws replacement . Mr. Obama cites the millions who have signed up for insurance as evidence of the laws success .Opposition to the president runs deep in the four states . In Arkansas , for example , 64 percent of respondents said they disapproved of his handling of health care . Still , the poll revealed that 60 percent of people in North Carolina and 52 percent of people in Louisiana and Kentucky would rather the law be made better than taken away . In Arkansas , 48 percent were in favor of improvements and 46 percent for repealing the law and replacing it .National polls have identified the sentiment before , but the fact that it surfaced in four states that voted Republican in the last election underscored just how deeply it is held .Democrats in Congress have requested changes to the law , arguing that earlier major pieces of social legislation , like Medicare , underwent revisions . But Republicans , who control the House , have refused to allow fixes , pushing for repeal and replacement .Views fell along predictably partisan lines , with large shares of Republicans in all four states preferring repeal and replacement and most Democrats opting for improvements . Independents were much more evenly divided , and in North Carolina and Louisiana , majorities preferred improvements .Perhaps more surprising were views on Medicaid , the medical program for the poor that only about half the states expanded under the law . When asked what states should do about Medicaid , the respondents offered substantial support for expansion .In Arkansas , a majority backed it , while less than a quarter opted for what the state actually chose  a private option under which the state used federal money to purchase private insurance for the poor through the new health care marketplace . Even among Republicans in the state , half supported Medicaid expansion while 21 percent liked the private option . In Louisiana and North Carolina , more than half of people agreed that their state should expand Medicaid and use federal funding to cover most of the cost .While the health law has punched a hole in Mr. Obamas approval rating , it does not seem to have substantially harmed the Democratic governors of Arkansas and Kentucky , who have approval rates of 65 percent and 55 percent respectively , though they backed the law . In contrast , their Republican counterparts in Louisiana and North Carolina are both at 41 percent approval .The law is complicated and the polls findings showed the continuing confusion about it , including in Louisiana and North Carolina , which did not take money from the federal government to promote it . Only about 44 percent of people in Louisiana knew that the law provides financial help to low-income people to purchase insurance .I think what would make it better would be to make it easier to understand ,  said Shirley Bates , a Republican from Ringgold , La. , who is unemployed . I live with my mother and we dont have a computer and we just get what we hear on the TV and from talking to others.It appears from the poll that the news media did not help much . A majority of respondents in all four states said media coverage of the law had focused on politics and controversies , instead of on how the law might impact people .Majorities in each state said the law had had no effect on them personally . Still , among those who said they had been touched by it , about twice as many said they had been hurt by the law as helped .Among those who said the law hurt had them , a majority in each state said it had increased their costs . About three in 10 people said they know someone who had lost coverage because of the law , and about a quarter in each state said they knew someone who had lost a job or had hours cut .I was just shocked by how much the premium actually went up ,  said Jack Hutson , 43 , a disabled veteran from White Hall , Ark . But the outcome was not all bad : His brother got insurance through the law and has managed to get a hernia fixed .Interviews were conducted by landline and cellphone from April 8 to 15 among a total sample of 4,152 adults in the four states with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points in each state ."
1	"During college , Lauren Braun worked at a health clinic in Peru , where she spent an inordinate amount of time tracking down mothers in an effort to get them to bring their children in for vaccinations . The experience was frustrating , but through it Braun came up with a business plan : Make silicone bracelets that function as punch cards , to remind mothers about upcoming appointments . Back in the United States , she consulted with mentors and perfected the idea , but then , she set it aside after graduation , going to work for a large health-insurance company , taking a salary and benefits over the uncertain life of an entrepreneur .A year and a half later , she got word that her bracelet company , Alma Sana , might have a life after all : The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation had awarded her $ 100,000 to test the idea . Braun was O.K . with the 60 percent pay cut she would take by quitting her day job . But she did not want to lose her health insurance .Were it not for Obamacare , Braun , 25 , would be confronting a phenomenon that economists call job lock : when people stay in jobs they dislike , or dont want , solely to keep their health coverage . A Harvard Business School study in 2008 estimated that 11 million workers are affected by this dilemma . Other studies show that when people dont have to worry about health insurance , they are up to 25 percent more likely to change jobs . Obamacare was designed , in part , to fix this inefficiency in the labor market , and thanks to that association , job lock has become a political lightning rod .In a sense , Obamacare amounts to a massive transfer of risk . Under the old system , if you quit your job and couldnt get health insurance , you courted financial ruin every time you did something as mundane as riding your bike or playing pickup basketball . Now that risk is distributed to everyone who buys health insurance ( including the government ) . Free of the massive financial risk of being alive , unemployed Americans can more easily take on risks associated with doing what they want to do .Though this is a good thing for people like Braun , it doesnt look good for the labor force as a whole  at least on the surface . In February , the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the Affordable Care Act would reduce employment by the equivalent of 2.5 million full-time jobs . Opponents seized on this as evidence that Obamacare is a job killer . But thats not what the C.B.O . meant . The estimated reduction stems almost entirely from a net decline in the amount of labor that workers choose to supply , rather than from a net drop in businesses demand for labor ,  the report says . In other words , if people work less , it will be by choice .It may seem counterintuitive , but from an economics perspective , this is a good thing , because it encourages the labor force to allocate itself more efficiently . Older workers will finally be able to retire , leaving openings for younger workers . People will switch to jobs that better suit their talents . Parents will be able to spend more time with their families . Such changes dont always make people wealthier , but they make people happier .This is allowing people to not have to stay in overworked , dead-end jobs that are probably making them sicker , any longer than they need to ,  says John de Graaf , executive director of Take Back Your Time , an organization dedicated to reducing overwork . De Graaf says that people who work long hours with little control over their schedules are more likely to suffer ill health effects like heart disease . So increasing their choices , he says , may save more money on health than the act itself.The health care law does contain some perverse incentives , which might make some people less productive . Low-income workers , who stand to lose their insurance subsidies if they earn too much , might drop out of full-time jobs .Conservative critics of Obamacare have latched onto this , and have been quick to mock the very notion that workers are locked to their jobs . Youre not being fired ,  tweeted David Burge , the conservative blogger and humorist . Youre just being freed from the job lock that keeps you from stardom in interpretive dance.But in reality , many Republicans have long talked about the need to liberate workers from job lock , and conservative arguments against the Affordable Care Act willfully ignore the fact that giving workers more freedom benefits a favorite constituency : Would-be entrepreneurs . These future innovators might just be chained to their corporate gigs , unable to boost the economy with small-business hiring . Access to health insurance outside of work should enable them to take the leap .James Bailey , a graduate student in economics at Temple University , came up with a clever way to test that theory : he looked at what happened to 19- to 25-year-olds when the Affordable Care Act made it possible for them to stay on their parents health insurance plans , beginning in 2010 . Those who got the coverage , he found , were two to three times more likely to go into business for themselves . And that increase was largely driven by women , who are generally more risk-averse than men .Women are more sensitive to the safety net in general ,  says Sarah Hamersma , an economist at Syracuse University . She found that when states expanded Medicaid eligibility , single mothers who had insurance through their employers were more likely to change jobs . That was true even if they did not qualify for Medicaid , suggesting that just knowing the safety net was there encouraged them to take risks . If part of what causes the wage gap between men and women is that women seek jobs with greater flexibility ( and lower pay ) , then more self-employment might help fix that .Still , having the government equalize risk cuts both ways . With Alma Sanas initial feasibility study complete , Lauren Braun is currently spending a few months in Germany , where the safety net is robust . Entrepreneurs there tell her they are envious of Americans . Theres a lot fewer investors here ,  Braun says . In part , thats because theres less wealth , fewer millionaires and fewer angel investors ( or , in the case of her benefactor , the Gates Foundation , people with so much money they just give it away ) .Our economy needs risk-takers in order to grow . Thats why the government creates programs to mitigate risk . For example , insuring student loans softens the risk of investing in an education . The bankruptcy system lessens the risk of starting a business .When Braun got the grant to start Alma Sana , the Gates Foundations generosity might have been pointless had it not been possible for her to go on her parents health plan . Without that , she says : I would have had to have gotten a different full-time job in addition to doing this , and that would have been really challenging . Ive worked 12 hours a day from the beginning of this grant period. Meanwhile , the bracelets , which cost just pennies to make , could save thousands of lives and millions of dollars in wasted vaccines  or her startup might fail entirely . Thats a gamble Braun chose to take ."
1	"During the run-up to this mornings Supreme Court health care ruling , liberals insisted over and over again that a decision overturning Obamacare would represently a nakedly political move by the courts conservatives , rather than a decision motivated by an honest , principled interpretation of the Constitution and the law . Which makes it ironic that  upon first reading , at least  Obamacare seems to have been saved by Chief Justice Robertss decision to put political considerations ahead of a straightforward reading of the health care bill .The four liberal justices determined that an individual mandate to purchase health insurance was a plausible extension of the Congresss Commerce Clause power . Given the ever-expansive liberal view of federal power and the long-running liberal commitment to a living ,  evolving Constitution , this was a perfectly principled decision . The conservative bloc , joined by Justice Kennedy , determined that such a mandate was an indefensible extension of that same power  and again , for all the liberal sturm und drang about partisanship ,  given conservative premises about the Constitution and the limits it places on federal power this was an entirely plausible and principled view as well .Chief Justice Roberts , though , agreed with the conservatives on the merits of the Commerce Clause issue , but ruled that because the mandate  despite being explicitly described as a penalty  could be construed as a tax instead , it should be allowed to stand . He mustered constitutional rather than political arguments for this construal , of course  citing , for instance , a prior decision in which the Court stated that every reasonable construction must be resorted to , in order to save a statute from unconstitutionality. But to my admittedly non-expert eyes , Robertss attempt at a reasonable construction looks more like a re-construction , and his ruling reads as a decision made much , much more out of deference to the legislative and executive branches than out of a straightforward application of the Chief Justices views of the Constitution to the plain language of the statute .This will not be a popular view among conservatives today , but I think that such deference is a defensible way for a restraint-minded Supreme Court Justice to approach his role in our republic . Nonetheless , liberals who waxed hysterical about a politicized court need to reckon with the fact that the most political of all the opinions on the health care law was the one that ultimately upheld it ."

1	"ERWIN , N.C.  Eleven years after becoming a national TV sensation , Clay Aiken still attracts a crowd in central North Carolina . In an hour he could only get a block or so down the street during an old textile town 's fall festival while fans stopped to talk and take pictures .`` I ca n't believe you 're here ! '' exclaimed Suzanne Strickland , 23 , after she and her mother left their craft booth at Erwin Denim Days . `` I saw you watching 'American Idol ' ! ''Finishing second for Congress wo n't cut it for the 2003 runner-up on the Fox show that vaulted him to a singing career and another second-place finish on NBC 's `` Celebrity Apprentice . '' Rather , he would just be another Democratic candidate who failed to beat the odds on North Carolina 's congressional map since Republicans redrew it and shifted the delegation 's makeup to the right .While national Democratic groups have n't arrived with financial support , Aiken believes there 's a path to victory in the U-shaped 2nd District over Republican Rep. Renee Ellmers . He 's trying to attract independent and Republican voters who recall his appearances as a crooner , and he 's hoping to catch breaks on the waves of unhappiness with Republican state government and gridlocked Washington politics .`` People are very dissatisfied with Congress in general and getting absolutely nothing done , '' Aiken said in an interview . He said Ellmers , a nurse , is wrongly fixated on repealing President Barack Obama 's signature health care law , rather than fixing its problems . `` If after three or four years , you still have n't gotten anything done , then what are you getting paid for ? ''Ellmers , who like Aiken was a first-time candidate four years ago when she upset Democratic Rep. Bob Etheridge , is throwing political inexperience back at Aiken and suggesting he 's role-playing to win votes .`` He 's an entertainer . He 's an actor , '' Ellmers , 50 , said in an interview after addressing the Kiwanis Club in Apex earlier this month . `` He believes that he can change costume and get into character and speak to whichever group and win them over . ''Ellmers is surely favored in a district anchored by Fort Bragg , affluent suburbs west of Raleigh , retirees near the famous Pinehurst golf resort and solid red south of Greensboro . The 2011 redistricting made the district swing more Republican , as Mitt Romney received nearly 58 percent of the 2012 presidential vote there , according to an analysis by the business advocacy group the North Carolina Chamber .If the race were competitive , outside groups would be investing in Aiken 's candidacy , said North Carolina Chamber political director Nathan Babcock , but he expected they wo n't because they 've got more pressing races .Scott Falmlen , a longtime Democratic political consultant in Raleigh , believes there 's a recipe for Democratic success in the district and says Aiken is following it well . But Falmlen is n't willing to predict a victory . Aiken raised more than $ 1 million for his campaign since February , benefiting from Broadway and Los Angeles events along the way . He hired veteran strategists and scheduled a bus trip through the district in the campaign 's final three weeks . Ellmers , who has raised more than $ 1.8 million this cycle , is battling anti-incumbent sentiment .Aiken has `` presented himself as a very credible candidate and I think some people wondered whether that would be the case , '' said Falmlen , who is n't working with Aiken . `` He comes across as knowledgeable of the issues . ''During a Saturday in the 2nd District , Aiken , 35 , engaged well-wishers as they browsed jewelry and ate barbecue , stopping for photos and hugs . But he also discussed veterans ' medical care and Medicaid expansion . He gave stickers to GOP voters that read `` Republaiken , '' wordplay on his name and the opposition party .Ellmers `` has done absolutely nothing and I 'm ready for a change , '' said registered Republican Peter de Young , 67 , of Pinehurst , who met Aiken at a street fair in Cameron .Ellmers , who frequents cable news shows and heads the Republican Women 's Policy Committee , blames Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid for refusing to consider House legislation . `` I ca n't force the Senate to act , but the American people can , '' she said , suggesting they should turn the Senate majority Republican next month .Aiken has tried to distance himself from Obama , saying he disagrees with him on issues and believes several changes should be made to the president 's signature health care law . But during their lone televised debate , Ellmers contended that , in the end , `` you support Obamacare . ''Aiken is a gay man running in a largely conservative district . Among passers-by in Erwin , it was n't an issue . `` That 's his choice , that 's his life . It does n't affect me at all , '' said Susan Boggs , 38 , of Erwin .Aiken supports gay marriage while Ellmers does not , though she publicly opposed the 2012 constitutional amendment in North Carolina that banned gay marriage . Both said during their debate that the issue of same-sex marriage , which is being decided in federal courts across the country , is out of their hands .Aiken received almost 12 million votes nationwide while narrowly losing to `` Idol '' winner Ruben Studdard in 2003 . This year , he edged out a well-known local businessman in the Democratic primary . It may take the ardent support of local `` Claymates ''  Aiken 's fan base during his `` Idol '' run to win the title of congressman ."
1	"Eduardo Porter is getting a lot of attention for his piece in todays paper suggesting that what Republicans fear most is that Obamacare might succeed . He deserves it : its a very good piece . But I guess Im surprised that so many people seem to find this a surprising and new insight . I thought it was obvious . Heres a column I wrote back in July predicting more or less what is now happening , for exactly the reason Porter gives : GOP panic over the prospect of successful health reform .And lets be clear : the health reform fight has always been about more than health reform . Liberals have long viewed health reform as the opening wedge , a sort of proof of concept , in a campaign to strengthen the US safety net and reduce income inequality ; that was basically what I was urging in Conscience of a Liberal , which gave its title to this blog .Conversely , the right has long opposed health reform for exactly the same reason : it might , in the publics mind , legitimate further government intervention to increase economic security .But lets also be clear that these positions are not symmetric . Liberals favored health reform both because it would work and because it might enhance their ability to push for other policies ; conservatives were and are determined to kill health reform even though it would work  in fact , precisely because it would work  because it might weaken the rest of their agenda . Basically , liberals wanted to do something good that would enlighten the public ; conservatives want to prevent something good because they want to keep voters in the dark .Now , if Obamacare turns out to be the dismal failure every Republican insists , at least publicly , it will be , it will redound to the rights benefit . But thats not going to happen , and the behavior of the GOP shows that at some level they know thats not going to happen .So my plot is working , mwahahahaha . Although I didnt consider the side effect  benefit or cost ?  that health reform would drive conservatives stark raving mad ."
1	"Enroll America is an organization with a big job : to find the uninsured around the country and persuade them to sign up for health insurance . It needs a good way to find them .The organization realized early that it would need a detailed picture of just who was uninsured in the country and where they lived . The model they built underlies the maps and demographic summaries in The Upshots article today on who was helped most by Obamacare . Enroll , which is financed by charitable foundations , health care companies and private individuals , enlisted the help of data professionals who worked in the Obama campaigns get-out-the-vote effort . It partnered with the data group Civis Analytics , which has worked extensively with political campaigns to find potential voters and persuade them to vote for particular candidates .The group wanted to be ready for outreach efforts in 2013 before the major coverage expansion provisions of the Affordable Care Act went live in January of this year . It wanted to persuade people to sign up during the open enrollment period , which began last October .To start , it conducted a huge phone survey of 12,000 adults around the country who use cellphones and land lines , asking people 10 basic questions in either English or Spanish . Then it folded in publicly available data about those individuals and their communities , using commercial databases and statistics from the census . It considered about 500 variables ; the final model used a smaller number , 30 , that together made a strong prediction . The goal was to create a score for each person that reflected the odds that the person would be uninsured .Then Enroll started sharing the scores with its workers and partners working in local communities . It found that neighborhood data was more useful than individual scores . Outreach workers focused on groups at the ZIP code level . With door-to-door canvassing , it helps to pick the neighborhoods where the greatest number of door knocks will find a person who is uninsured . In addition to door-knocking , and mailing fliers , the organization and its partners also bought targeted advertising and pursued community-organizing activities , like educating members of the clergy in communities with a lot of churchgoing uninsured people .We started using the model initially to try to get to people at an individual level , and there was a degree of accuracy there ,  said Gregg Ross , Enrolls organizing director in North Carolina , one of 11 states where the group made a big push . Once we started using it for this geographic targeting and coupling it with our knowledge of the communities , we were finding that upward of 80 percent of the people we contacted were uninsured.Rosss high hit rate mirrored that of other Enroll workers and volunteers , and is one of the signs that the model is accurate . If the model was sending them to neighborhoods where they were not finding many uninsured people , it might suggest a glitch in the data . Over all , Enrolls data team said that , at the neighborhood level , their door knocks last year varied by only about one percentage point from what the model was predicting .Enroll then repeated the whole survey-and-model process this summer to capture 2014 numbers , though its survey group was smaller  about 8,000 people . Its objective was to measure its results  just how many people signed up in the places it was targeting with personal contact  and to help develop its strategy for the second year of open enrollment .Its efforts also provide a window into where the Affordable Care Act is having the biggest impact on the uninsured rate around the country . That was the part that was particularly interesting to The Upshot . For the 2014 model , the most powerful variable was someones 2013 uninsured score . But Enroll also examined 200 other variables and ended up with a model that included last years score and about 15 other facts about each person .One of the reasons the Enroll data is so fascinating is because , more than any other public data source , it gives us a much more rich and detailed picture of who has insurance and how that is changing .But that also means that its hard to check the Enroll data against other measurements for accuracy . Its important to understand that a model like Enrolls is different from simple observations of peoples personal characteristics and insurance status , like those measured by the Census Bureau . The census is working to capture this same type of detailed picture of insurance status and other demographic characteristics , but because of its huge sample size and careful process , its data is published slowly . A full picture of who had insurance in 2014 isnt expected until September of next year . Enroll did crosscheck its 2013 findings against the 2012 census numbers and found sufficient overlap ; 2012 and 2013 were very similar years for the uninsured rate .The Enroll story is roughly consistent with several private surveys that have been published . Like large , random telephone surveys by Gallup and the Commonwealth Fund , Enroll measured a five-percentage-point drop in the uninsured rate between 2013 and 2014 , or a reduction of about 10 million people . But its uninsured rates in both years were slightly lower than those of the other groups .Enrolls data team members said that they know the base file they used to make phone calls included fewer men , fewer Hispanics and fewer poor people than the census measures because those people were harder to find and survey . That undercounting may explain its lower uninsured numbers . Its state-level insurance rate changes were also roughly comparable to state-level survey results from Gallup , the only organization with 50-state numbers , though there are some discrepancies .The differences between the other surveys and Enrolls numbers mean that there may be some inaccuracies in the Enroll model . It may also mean that there are inaccuracies in the private polls . But theres no reason to think that Enrolls numbers are deliberately biased . Though many of the people working on the model were advocates for President Obama and are supporters of the Affordable Care Act , their organizations motivation is to find the most uninsured people to target , not to paint a particular portrait of how the law is performing .If we built a systematic bias into it , we would literally be handicapping our own organization ,  said Matthew Saniie , Enrolls analytics and data director . Thats not smart : One great story versus handicapping the efforts of thousands of people across the country doesnt balance itself out."
1	"Et tu , C.D.C . ?For years , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been the most trusted agency in the federal government . In 2003 , when Gallup did a survey to determine what the public thought of various federal agencies , the C.D.C . topped the list , with 66 percent of respondents describing it as excellent or good.Last year , a similar Gallup poll showed that the C.D.C . 's approval rating had dropped to 60 percent , which was still better than any other agency . The C.D.C . has seen the country through SARS and the swine flu virus . The general perception was not only that it did important , apolitical work , but that it was highly competent . I used to call the C.D.C . the shining star of federal agencies ,  says Lawrence O. Gostin , a global health expert at Georgetown Law .And then came Ebola .The Ebola outbreak is not exactly enhancing the C.D.C . 's reputation for competence . At first , the agency reassured the public that American hospitals were ready to handle any Ebola cases that came their way . That has turned out not to be the case . When Thomas Eric Duncan was diagnosed with Ebola in Dallas , the C.D.C . did not immediately fly in an expert team  something that the C.D.C . director , Tom Frieden , now says it should have done . Most recently , the C.D.C . appears to have allowed one of the Dallas nurses who helped Duncan to take a flight from Ohio to Texas even though she had a slightly raised temperature . When it became clear that she had contracted the virus  the second nurse to do so  Frieden was forced to admit that letting her on the plane was a mistake .Meanwhile , Frieden , a highly respected public health expert , had to walk back some of his remarks . Congress  including Democrats  appears dismayed by the mistakes . Perhaps the biggest one the C.D.C . made was that its voluntary guidelines for treating Ebola patients were too lax . In The Times a few days ago , Donald G. McNeil quoted several experts saying the protocols established by the C.D.C . were , in the words of one , absolutely irresponsible and dead wrong. One important protocol is having a site supervisor watching for errors . The C.D.C . has now included that guideline .Are there extenuating circumstances ? To hear infectious disease specialists tell it , the answer is yes . Like all federal agencies , the C.D.C . saw significant cuts to its funding thanks to sequestration . Another expert , Marc Lipsitch of the Harvard School of Public Health , told me in an email that because the chances of Ebola being imported to the U.S. were considered low , preparing for it was not considered a good use of scarce public money . The budget cuts ,  he wrote , have directly reduced preparedness.In addition , the C.D.C. , like many federal agencies , had its mission transformed after 9/11 . Julie Gerberding , an appointee of the Bush administration , changed its emphasis to bioterrorism and other potential security threats . She also brought in efficiency experts who were anathema to scientists ,  says Laurie Garrett , a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations and the author of the seminal 1994 book , The Coming Plague. Morale plummeted , and many of its best scientists fled .Fair enough . But it is also true that the C.D.C . was too hubristic in its approach to Ebola , and the consequence is that its staff now looks like bumblers . They never challenged their own assumptions ,  says Dr. Richard Wenzel , an infectious disease specialist at Virginia Commonwealth University . This is an unforgiving virus ,  he added , about which there is a lot we dont know. The C.D.C . 's unfortunate habit of saying things as if they were certainties only to have to acknowledge that its judgment was questionable , says Wenzel , can cause people to lose faith in the public health system.When you think about it , many of the Obama administrations scandals have been failures of competence . The Secret Service let a man leap over the White House fence and get into the White House . The Veterans Health Administration covered up unconscionable delays in treating veterans . The error-ridden rollout of the Obamacare website was a nightmare for people trying to sign up for health insurance . The Republican right takes it as an article of faith that the national government cant do anything right . Problems like these only help promote that idea .And now comes the C.D.C .  the most trusted agency in government  thrust in a role for which it was designed : advising us and protecting us from a potential contagion . With every new mistake , it becomes , in the public eye , just another federal agency that cant get it right ."
1	"Ever since they emerged in the early 1800s , political parties have been a target of public scorn . But they have always had their defenders  a smaller , less influential camp that holds that parties are more beneficial than harmful because they play an essential role in mediating political disputes .The anti-party forces fitfully succeed in enacting laws and rules to restrain party organizations and bosses , including the adoption of referendum and recall procedures ; requirements that states pick delegates to the national conventions through primaries and caucuses ; bans on closed-door meetings ; the prohibition of legislative earmarks ; and legislation that restricts the size and source of contributions to the national political parties .The intensity of polarized politics at every level of government now puts the dispute over political parties at the center of a debate among office holders , political scientists , legal experts and partisan activists . Is it possible that strengthening the parties could lessen polarization ?The pro-party camp contends that many reforms have unintentionally fostered polarization : diminishing the clout of parties and party leaders undermines their role as a force for moderation and compromise .Nathaniel Persily , a professor of law at Stanford , is a proponent of strong , well-financed parties . Polarization , he wrote in an email to me , is a cost of many of these good government reforms . It is almost an intended cost if you think about it. Why ? Persily argues that the purpose ofIn Strengthening Parties ,  a chapter in the forthcoming volume Solutions to Political Polarization in America ,  Persily contends that in the case of campaign finance , the good good-government reforms that have been tried have , if anything , made things worse.The claim that reforms have made things worse is based on the interaction between the 2002 McCain-Feingold Act , which regulated campaign finance , and two 2010 court decisions , the Supreme Court ruling in Citizens United and the Court of Appeals for the D.C . Circuit decision Speechnow.org v. F.E.C .The McCain-Feingold Act prohibited political parties from accepting unlimited contributions from corporations , unions and rich people , which had come to be called soft money.The federal court decisions , in contrast , explicitly allowed independent political groups  including both super PACs and politically active nonprofits  to accept all forms of soft money .Pro-party advocates argue that McCain-Feingold in particular has undermined political parties , while court rulings have empowered donors and independent committees , many of whom have agendas more polarizing than those of the parties .At a Bipartisan Policy Center conference in Washington earlier this month organized to explore the current campaign finance situation , Ray La Raja , a political scientist at the University of Massachusetts , made a case , like Persily , in support of political parties:La Raja , who has been working with Brian F. Schaffner , another UMass political scientist , presented slides comparing states that limit contributions to political parties with states without such limits . In the states without limits , a much higher proportion of the total contributions to candidates , especially to centrist-moderate candidates , comes from the parties than it does in states with limits . In addition , the degree of ideological polarization between Republicans and Democrats in legislatures in states without limits is substantially lower than it is in states with limits , as Figure 1 demonstrates .Thomas E. Mann , a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who is a strong supporter of McCain-Feingold , disagrees with Persily and La Raja . At the conference , and in later email exchanges , Mann made a number of key points .First of all , Mann contends , Republicans are the driving force behind polarization . Their opposition to Democratic proposals is based less on ideological principle than on a strategic political decision to oppose President Obama on every front , even when he takes a position previously advocated by conservatives . Examples of the latter include the individual mandate under Obamacare and end-of-life counseling .Much of the acrimony and gridlock is not a consequence of ideological issues or campaign finance , Mann told participants at the conference . Instead , he argues , its strategic  its all about capturing a majority in the House and Senate , and the White House.According to Mann,Michael Barber , a political scientist at Brigham Young University who supports strong political parties , provided evidence to the conference that altering campaign finance laws has significant costs and benefits  trade-offs in every direction .Barber presented slides that showed that individual contributors to candidates are strikingly ideological and partisan , thus fueling polarization . That is , contributions from traditional PACs , which give relatively small amounts directly to candidates , are focused on the goal of gaining access , and thus are far more politically centrist ( Figure 2 ) .In a working paper on the impact that campaign finance regulation has on state elected officials , Barber found that legislators who raise more money from individuals are more likely to be ideologically extreme ,  while higher limits on contributions from PACs yield more ideologically moderate legislators.One interpretation of Barbers findings is that a reduction in the number of contributions from individual donors , including small donors , would diminish ideological conflict . This would mean , in effect , abandoning the long-sought goal of increasing participation in the campaign finance process . Conversely , by this reasoning , advocates of increased participation by small donors will have to tolerate exacerbated polarization and gridlock if they are successful .I asked Barber in an email about these conflicts , and he wrote thatNot an attractive option for either side . Reformers and party loyalists both face what Persily describes as a devils choice.McCain-Feingold does appear to have contributed to a decline in Republican Party fund-raising , and to the end of rising cash totals for Democratic Party committees . According to the Campaign Finance Institute , Democratic Party fund-raising grew from $ 229.8 million in 1992 to $ 626.5 million in 2000 , the last presidential election year in which soft money contributions were permitted . Since then , Democratic totals have remained virtually level , reaching $ 631.1 million in 2012 ( all these figures are adjusted for inflation ) .On the Republican side , the post-McCain-Feingold election years have produced a substantial decline in donations , which fell to $ 697.7 million in 2012 from $ 815.3 million in 2000 .But insofar as the parties are struggling , it is far more the result of court rulings that have led to an explosion of outside spending , which , in key battleground contests in the current election cycle , often eclipses spending by the parties .Experts who are at the heart of these developments argue that the courts over the past four years have tipped the balance in favor of independent political committees . Bob Bauer , a prominent Democratic campaign finance lawyer who spoke at the Washington conference , noted that there are enormous differences between parties and outside groups ,  but the legal system now privileges the groups.The result is a distorted balance of financial and political power with the least accountable organizations gaining the most leverage over our campaigns . And yet , as we try to fix that problem and to address the general disrepute into which American politics has fallen , we have to think hard about how the unintended consequences of prior efforts at reform have helped to bring us where we are now ."

Instead , he argues , its strategic  its all about capturing a majority in the House and Senate , and the White House.According to Mann,Michael Barber , a political scientist at Brigham Young University who supports strong political parties , provided evidence to the conference that altering campaign finance laws has significant costs and benefits  trade-offs in every direction .Barber presented slides that showed that individual contributors to candidates are strikingly ideological and partisan , thus fueling polarization . That is , contributions from traditional PACs , which give relatively small amounts directly to candidates , are focused on the goal of gaining access , and thus are far more politically centrist ( Figure 2 ) .In a working paper on the impact that campaign finance regulation has on state elected officials , Barber found that legislators who raise more money from individuals are more likely to be ideologically extreme ,  while higher limits on contributions from PACs yield more ideologically moderate legislators.One interpretation of Barbers findings is that a reduction in the number of contributions from individual donors , including small donors , would diminish ideological conflict . This would mean , in effect , abandoning the long-sought goal of increasing participation in the campaign finance process . Conversely , by this reasoning , advocates of increased participation by small donors will have to tolerate exacerbated polarization and gridlock if they are successful .I asked Barber in an email about these conflicts , and he wrote thatNot an attractive option for either side . Reformers and party loyalists both face what Persily describes as a devils choice.McCain-Feingold does appear to have contributed to a decline in Republican Party fund-raising , and to the end of rising cash totals for Democratic Party committees . According to the Campaign Finance Institute , Democratic Party fund-raising grew from $ 229.8 million in 1992 to $ 626.5 million in 2000 , the last presidential election year in which soft money contributions were permitted . Since then , Democratic totals have remained virtually level , reaching $ 631.1 million in 2012 ( all these figures are adjusted for inflation ) .On the Republican side , the post-McCain-Feingold election years have produced a substantial decline in donations , which fell to $ 697.7 million in 2012 from $ 815.3 million in 2000 .But insofar as the parties are struggling , it is far more the result of court rulings that have led to an explosion of outside spending , which , in key battleground contests in the current election cycle , often eclipses spending by the parties .Experts who are at the heart of these developments argue that the courts over the past four years have tipped the balance in favor of independent political committees . Bob Bauer , a prominent Democratic campaign finance lawyer who spoke at the Washington conference , noted that there are enormous differences between parties and outside groups ,  but the legal system now privileges the groups.The result is a distorted balance of financial and political power with the least accountable organizations gaining the most leverage over our campaigns . And yet , as we try to fix that problem and to address the general disrepute into which American politics has fallen , we have to think hard about how the unintended consequences of prior efforts at reform have helped to bring us where we are now ."
1	"Ezra Klein is puzzled ( or at least says he is ; I suspect he understands it perfectly ) by Republican hypocrisy on health care . For many years the GOP has advocated things that are supposed to bring the magic of the marketplace and individual incentives to health care : higher deductibles to give people skin in the game , competition among private insurers via exchanges  competition that would include reducing costs by limiting networks  and , of course , for cuts in Medicare . Now the GOP complains bitterly that some Obamacare policies have high deductibles , that it relies on the horror of exchanges , that some networks are limited , and that there are cuts in Medicare .Klein suggests that Republicans are really upset by other aspects of Obamacare , but are going after the easy targets even though theyre attacking their own ideas . In a sense hes right , but as I said , I suspect that he knows that the issue is both bigger and simpler than he says .What underlies what Jonathan Chait calls the Heritage uncertainty principle ? He describes it thus:Conservative health-care-policy ideas reside in an uncertain state of quasi-existence . You can describe the policies in the abstract , sometimes even in detail , but any attempt to reproduce them in physical form will cause such proposals to disappear instantly . Its not so much an issue of hypocrisy ,  as Klein frames it , as a deeper metaphysical question of whether conservative health-care policies actually exist .The question should be posed to better-trained philosophical minds than my own . I would posit that conservative health-care policies do not exist in any real form . Call it the Heritage Uncertainty Principle.Well , actually its pretty simple . The purpose of most health care reform is to help the unfortunate  people with pre-existing conditions , people who dont get insurance through their jobs , people who just dont earn enough to afford insurance . Cost control is also part of the picture , but not the dominant part . And what were seeing right now , in any case , seems to confirm a point some of us have been making for a long time : controlling costs and expanding access are complementary targets , because you cant sell things like cost-saving measures for Medicaid and limits on deductibility of premiums unless theyre part of a larger scheme to make the system fairer and more comprehensive .And heres the thing : Republicans dont want to help the unfortunate . Theyll propound health-care ideas that will , they claim , help those with preexisting conditions and so on  but those arent really proposals , theyre diversionary tactics designed to stall real health reform . Chait finds Newt Gingrich more or less explicitly admitting this .Hence the rage of the right . Here they were , with a whole raft of ideas they could throw out , like chaff thrown out to confuse enemy radar , to divert and confuse any attempt to actually provide insurance to the uninsured . And those dastardly Democrats have gone ahead and actually incorporated those ideas into real reform .Once you realize this , you also realize that people who warn that by opposing Obamacare Republicans are undermining their own proposals are missing the point . Yes , the Ryan plan to privatize Medicare looks a lot like Obamacare  but Ryan comes to Medicare not to save it , but to bury it , so the question of whether his plan could work is irrelevant .Theres no mystery here ; its just top-down class warfare as usual ."
1	"FOR the second time in four years , the Republican Party has won a sweeping midterm victory without having a policy agenda to match . The party has a more-than-comfortable House majority , a solid Senate edge , and it faces a lame-duck president sealed in a bubble of sour self-regard .

Now , unlike then , actual flesh-and-blood Republican politicians have proposed substantial policy ideas on issues as diverse as health care and transportation , higher education and taxes , the safety net and sentencing reform . The party as a whole hasnt rallied around these proposals , but theyre there and waiting to be taken up .The bad news for Republicans is that Americas permanent campaign is about to shift into a higher gear , because with the midterms over You Know What is coming next .

And that hope seems most likely to be realized if the primary field is winnowed early , and we end up with a contest that gives special prominence to Marco Rubio and Rand Paul .Rubio and Paul are not necessarily the most qualified of the Republican contenders  they are relatively young , they lack executive experience , and their legislative records are modest . But they are both deeply engaged with the challenges that would await a Republican president in a way that most of their potential rivals currently are not .Those rivals have either been out of national politics for a while ( Jeb Bush , Mike Huckabee ) , or they have been wrestling with state-level issues that dont necessarily map onto national policy debates .

But Rubio and Paul are well ahead when it comes to thinking seriously about what a 21st-century conservatism should stand for and pursue .Seriously , and differently . Rubio has gone further than any other likely 2016 contender in embracing whats been dubbed reform conservatism  a vision of domestic policy that would overhaul the tax code and safety net to support work , family and upward mobility . For the Florida senator , the details of that vision include tax reform that would expand the child tax credit , more substantial wage subsidies for childless adults , a Social Security reform that would open the programs Thrift Savings Plan for federal employees to more Americans  and a reform of Obamacare ( still in the planning stages ) that would try to cover similar numbers with less-comprehensive coverage .Paul , meanwhile , embodies a more libertarian approach to conservative reform , in which the Republican Party would shed its party of the rich branding and reach out to new constituencies ( minority voters and millennials , especially ) by focusing on issues  criminal justice reform , civil liberties , corporate welfare  where a critique of big or heavy-handed government might be unexpectedly resonant .There is overlap between his vision and Rubios , particularly on combating crony capitalism . But there is also a real philosophical difference between the two men on how much government should do to address social problems .On foreign policy their contrast sharpens , because Paul casts himself as the heir to the realist tradition in Republican foreign policy , while Rubios record and statements are more in line with the neoconservatism of the Bush era . To use specific Obama-era examples , a Paul-led G.O.P . would presumably oppose Libya-style humanitarian interventions and eschew gambits like our effort to aid Syrias rebels , while a Rubio-led G.O.P . might be willing to put American boots on the ground in both situations . These are not small differences , and they might be magnified in larger crises .This is the point in the column when I would normally signal , subtly or clumsily , whose vision I find more attractive over all . But the reality is that Im divided . I admire Pauls outreach to minority voters , and I was very skeptical of the immigration bill Rubio shepherded through the Senate last year . But I have agreed with practically every domestic policy stance the Florida senator has taken since , and his reform agenda seems more sensible on substance and more plausible as politics than Pauls more stringent libertarianism .But then on foreign policy my sympathies reverse . Pauls ties to his fathers more paranoid worldview are problematic , but the realism and restraint hes championing seem wiser than the G.O.P.s frequent interventionist tilt .

1	"FROM the moment the ink dried on March 23 , 2010 , Republicans said they intended to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act . They have voted more than 40 times to wipe the law from the books . But Republicans have never gotten around to describing , in detail , the set of policies they believe should replace Obamacare . That is , until yesterday .After nearly four years , we finally have a Republican counterproposal : the Patient Choice , Affordability , Responsibility and Empowerment ( or Patient CARE ) Act .Senators Tom Coburn , Richard Burr and Orrin Hatch deserve credit for developing this plan . Putting together a proposal to reform the American health care system is hard and politically courageous . And while it is lacking in important details , this plan contains some interesting ideas that might have enabled bipartisan compromises had they been offered in 2009 , when I was a health care adviser to the Obama administration and the Affordable Care Act was being debated . For instance , the plan would shift many low-income adults from Medicaid to subsidized private insurance . There are some Democrats who could certainly have supported such a proposal , if it had been offered as part of a deal to enact a bipartisan bill .Despite all the heated rhetoric from Republicans about Obamacare laying ruin to America , the plan would actually keep some of the laws key provisions . It would preserve some subsidies for lower-income people to buy private insurance , though it would change the way they are calculated . Those $ 700 billion worth of Medicare savings Mitt Romney denounced during the 2012 campaign ? Republicans would keep them . Allowing young adults to stay on their parents plan until age 26 ? Republicans would keep that , too . And the ban on lifetime insurance caps , so people with very expensive diseases dont lose insurance ? Republicans wouldnt touch it .But in other crucial ways , the Republican plan is different . First , Obamacares absolute ban on withholding coverage from people with pre-existing conditions would be rolled back . Those who remained continuously insured would stay protected , so they couldnt be charged higher rates or be excluded entirely . But if their insurance lapsed , health insurance companies could charge more or refuse to cover them .Second , it would shrink the Medicaid expansion . Pregnant women , children and families below the poverty line would still be eligible , but childless adults would not . States would be given a fixed amount per person enrolled in Medicaid to reduce spending .Third , the Republicans would provide tax credits for people to buy insurance , but only for families earning up to $ 70,650 per year . ( The Affordable Care Acts subsidies go to families earning up to $ 94,200 . ) And employees of large companies , even if those companies did not offer health insurance , would be exempt , regardless of income .The largest difference is in cost control . Currently , employer-sponsored health insurance is tax free ; the Republican plan would make employees pay income tax on at least 35 percent of what their company pays for their plan . The idea is to make patients pay more for their coverage , giving them an incentive to choose cheaper health insurance plans with more deductibles and co-payments , which , in turn , would encourage them to shop around for cheaper tests and treatments and forgo unnecessary ones .On a more individual level , this is what the Republican plan means : If you are one of the 150 million Americans who get their health insurance through an employer-sponsored plan , get ready for a big tax increase . For a family in the 28 percent tax bracket ( earning around $ 150,000 per year ) , according to my calculations , it would add up to about $ 1,470 per year .Heres how you get that number : In 2013 , the average employer-sponsored insurance plan cost $ 16,351 for a family of four . On average , employers pay 72 percent of that premium , or $ 11,786 . The Republican plan taxes 35 percent of the employer contribution , meaning that an additional $ 4,125 would be counted as income and subject to both payroll and income taxes . So that family would pay about $ 1,154 in income taxes and $ 316 in payroll taxes  $ 1,470 per year . Obviously , people would pay even more if their health-insurance premium was higher , if they were in a higher tax bracket , or if their state had an income tax .People who dont get insurance through their employer would also be likely to pay more . The Republican plan would provide the unemployed , people in the individual market and those working for small businesses that dont provide health insurance a tax credit to buy private insurance . But the credit increases only by age , not by need  which means people with lower incomes would pay much more than they would under Obamacare . For example , under the Republican plan , a 30-year-old man living in New York City earning $ 35,000 a year would pay the full price of insurance , roughly $ 4,383 for a typical plan . Under Obamacare , he would pay $ 3,325 . A 30-year-old earning $ 25,000 would get a $ 1,560 tax credit and pay roughly $ 2,823 under the Republican plan , but pay only $ 1,728 under Obamacare .In addition , the proposed plan would take us back to the old days when insurance companies could charge women more than men for the same health plan . And older people would also be penalized . Under the Affordable Care Act , insurance companies are allowed to charge 64-year-olds only three times what they charge 21-year-olds . But the Republican plan allows insurance companies to charge 64-year-olds five times more . So a 64-year-old individual could pay as much as $ 21,900 for a plan that costs a 21-year-old only $ 4,380 .The plan would bring back many insurance company shenanigans . For instance , the decision to roll back the ban on excluding those with pre-existing conditions sounds O.K . in theory : individuals moving from one health plan to another  regardless of whether it was in the individual , small group , or large employer markets  could not be medically underwritten ,  meaning charged higher premiums based on a disease , and denied a plan based on a pre-existing condition if they were continuously enrolled in a health plan. So if you lose your job and therefore your employer-sponsored health insurance , you would not be excluded for a pre-existing condition if you immediately bought your own insurance . But if there were a gap in coverage , insurance companies could deny you coverage .What if the paperwork you filled out is lost ? The history of insurance companies tricks for denying coverage to high-cost patients  like revoking the insurance of a cancer patient who failed to disclose that she had back problems  does not inspire confidence .Finally , there is the issue of prevention . The Affordable Care Act made preventive services free . To save money , Republicans want to reverse that , so that Americans will behave like cost-conscious consumers  getting their blood tests at a cheaper laboratory or their CT scans at the cheaper imaging center . The problem is that mountains of evidence show that when patients have to pay , prevention is the first thing to go , in part because people arent suffering pain or other symptoms , and the benefits of preventive services are typically years away . Saving money by cutting back these services makes no economic sense in the long-term .There are many other problematic things the Republican plan does , like eliminate the health laws taxes on health insurance , drug and device companies ; allow insurance companies to sell plans that dont cover maternity , mental health or other types of care ; and allow insurance companies to impose annual limits on benefits .We finally got the replace part of the Republicans pledge to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act . Now that Americans have the chance to examine the alternative , it might help them see the advantages of Obamacare ."
1	"For almost two months , the debacle of healthcare.gov allowed conservatives to live the life they always wanted . Health reform was a dismal failure ; Obama would go down in history as a laughingstock ; government cant do anything ; viva Ayn Rand !Meanwhile , the technicians were working on what was always a technical IT problem , not a problem with the fundamental structure of the law . And while things are far from completely fixed , the crisis is clearly over . Obamacare will have millions of beneficiaries by the time open enrollment ends ; it will add many more in the 2015 cycle . Health reform is pretty much irreversible at this point . Its even possible that memories of the initial botch will have faded enough by next November that Obamacare becomes a political plus in the midterms .That , at least , is how things look from where I sit . Apparently , however , many people on the right are still stuck on the notion that Obamacare is doomed , indeed that its collapsing as we speak . The latest version is the supposed death spiral of young people not signing up .As Ryan Cooper says , dont count on it . There are lots of good reasons for the young to sign up , including the fact that its the law . And pay no attention to polls suggesting that the young are now down on the whole thing  those polls are colored by the IT mess of October-November , which is not where we are now .Still , thats their line . And when you see a pundit making pronouncements on the state of affairs , you can get a good sense of his true political affiliations by where he comes out on this question . If a supposedly centrist pundit writes and talks as if Obamacare were in a doom loop , as opposed to the reality of ongoing recovery , you know which camp hes really in ."
1	"For more than five hours sometime next March , nine Supreme Court justices will hear arguments on the constitutionality of the individual health care mandate that President Obama pushed through Congress in early 2010 .It will very likely be an excruciating five hours for Mitt Romney .The courts move to hear the health care case next year  with a decision expected by June  will force a high-profile public debate over the individual mandate just as Mr. Romney may be trying to close out his battle for the Republican presidential nomination .For any other candidate in his position , that would be an opportunity to become the face of the Republican opposition to a health care law that the party has demonized . Representative Michele Bachmann , who has made vowing to repeal the law a pillar of her campaign , seized on it Monday .I urge the court to strike down the law and rule it unconstitutional ,  she declared in a statement . Furthermore , I call on President Obama and Congress to cease enforcement of the remaining provisions of Obamacare immediately until the Supreme Court rules on its constitutionality.You can imagine if Mrs. Bachmann were the partys nominee , she might be out there with a big anti-Obamacare sign , marching with protesters on the steps of the court building as the arguments are being made .Mr. Romney , by contrast , was silent on Monday , issuing no statements on the courts announcement . A spokeswoman for his campaign did not respond to e-mails seeking comment on the issue .No issue has dogged Mr. Romney more throughout the presidential campaign than health care . His efforts to pass an individual mandate in Massachusetts while he was governor have been repeatedly used by his rivals  Republican and Democratic  to try to undermine his candidacy .So far , those efforts have failed to sidetrack Mr. Romneys march to the Republican nomination ; he remains at the top of most surveys , nationally and in several of the important early states .And yet Mr. Romneys history on the issue creates a lost opportunity for his party if they choose him to be their standard-bearer in the campaign for the White House against Mr. Obama . By championing his own similar proposal , Mr. Romney can only be so effective at making the case against Mr. Obamas plan .That is not to say he has not tried . In several debates , and on the trail , Mr. Romney has adopted the Obamacare must go rhetoric of his rivals .Obamacare is wrong ,  he said during the recent debate hosted by CNBC . Ill repeal it . Ill get it done.But if he becomes the nominee , he will take up that mantle after months of being hammered by the left and the right as a conflicted messenger on the subject .From the right , he has been criticized by his rivals for the nomination , who point to early editions of his book No Apologies ,  in which he indicated that he believed the Massachusetts health care plan could be a model for the country . That notion was removed in later editions .Rick Santorum , the former senator from Pennsylvania , jabbed at Mr. Romneys health care credentials in the same debate , stating that I was always for having the government out of the health care business and for a bottom-up , consumer-driven health care , which is different than Governor Romney and some of the other people on this panel.Mr. Obamas campaign has been equally relentless in pointing out that the Mr. Romneys plan in Massachusetts was an inspiration for the federal health care law that eventually passed .And Mr. Romneys candidacy even inspired the creation of a group dedicated to pointing out supportive things he has said about individual mandates and other parts of Mr. Obamas health care law . The idea ? To make it harder for Mr. Romney to criticize the law later .Eddie Vale , a spokesman for the group , called Protect Your Care , last week called it a health care trap for Republicans . He argued that the more the party stokes voter anger about health care , the more it is a rebuke to Mr. Romney .If he is the nominee this is going to keep happening to them ad nauseam ,  Mr. Vale wrote in an e-mail to reporters .It is possible that Republicans could have the last laugh if they nominate Mr. Romney . Of all of the Republican candidates , he is the one most able to moderate his position on health care during a general election battle with Mr. Obama .If the court strikes down the health care law in June  just a couple of months before the Republican nominee gets formally selected at the national convention in Tampa , Fla.  Mr. Romney could make the argument to independents and disaffected Democrats that state-level plans , like the one he supported in Massachusetts , represents a better hope for actually getting something done on health care .But that would come along with a danger for Mr. Romney  that he is seen as once again changing his position on an important issue . His rhetoric opposing the law from the primary campaign will be hard to square with a more moderate position in the general election .And Mr. Obamas campaign is certainly ready to accuse him of being a flip-flopper ."

The idea ? To make it harder for Mr. Romney to criticize the law later .Eddie Vale , a spokesman for the group , called Protect Your Care , last week called it a health care trap for Republicans . He argued that the more the party stokes voter anger about health care , the more it is a rebuke to Mr. Romney .If he is the nominee this is going to keep happening to them ad nauseam ,  Mr. Vale wrote in an e-mail to reporters .It is possible that Republicans could have the last laugh if they nominate Mr. Romney . Of all of the Republican candidates , he is the one most able to moderate his position on health care during a general election battle with Mr. Obama .If the court strikes down the health care law in June  just a couple of months before the Republican nominee gets formally selected at the national convention in Tampa , Fla.  Mr. Romney could make the argument to independents and disaffected Democrats that state-level plans , like the one he supported in Massachusetts , represents a better hope for actually getting something done on health care .But that would come along with a danger for Mr. Romney  that he is seen as once again changing his position on an important issue . His rhetoric opposing the law from the primary campaign will be hard to square with a more moderate position in the general election .And Mr. Obamas campaign is certainly ready to accuse him of being a flip-flopper ."
1	"Fresh from his own re-election victory and his partys powerful showing nationwide , Senator Mitch McConnell on Wednesday pledged to break the stalemate in Washington as newly empowered congressional Republicans moved quickly to demonstrate that they can get things done . Were going to pass legislation ,  Mr. McConnell said at a news conference in Louisville , Ky. This gridlock and dysfunction can be ended.Despite their new majority in the Senate and an expanded one in the House , Republicans face multiple difficulties , not the least of which are internal divisions . But they say they know they have to deliver or face a backlash in 2016 .I think it really becomes important to appear to want to be a governing party rather than a complaining party ,  said Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri , a member of the party leadership . My belief is we have about six months before the American people check that box one way or the other.Anticipating for months that they would take the Senate and pad their majority in the House , Republicans have been quietly discussing their agenda and approach after regularly accusing Democrats , led by Senator Harry Reid of Nevada , the majority leader , of thwarting their priorities .They say they will focus on balancing the budget , restoring an orderly process for spending bills , revising if not repealing the health care law and enacting a major overhaul of the tax code  ambitious goals , given years of stalemate and discord .Before taking up the issue of immigration , Republicans are likely to see what unilateral action President Obama undertakes , and how the country reacts to it .Senate Republicans also intend to use their control of committees to bring new scrutiny to the White House , federal agencies and Mr. Obamas expanding use of executive authority . Mr. McConnell , who will succeed Mr. Reid as majority leader when the new Congress convenes in January , has also promised wholesale changes in the way the Senate operates , including a five-day workweek , more floor debate and empowered committee chairmen .Republicans say they intend to force Mr. Obama to make choices on bills passed by the House that Senate Democrats have been able to keep from his desk , potentially touching off the presidents first extensive use of the veto after six years in office .Some Democrats who have been frustrated by the stalemate in the Senate say they are open to cooperating with Republicans .Right now , we are helping destroy each other ,  said Senator Joe Manchin III , a centrist Democrat from West Virginia . I would like to think we can work together . Id like to get my amendments in debate.In gaining control of the Senate , however , Republicans ousted some of the red-state Democrats most inclined to work with them , such as Senator Mark Pryor of Arkansas , reducing the number of potential Democratic allies .Other tensions may complicate their efforts . Mr. McConnell , with few votes to spare , will have to balance the views of a handful of more moderate Republicans , such as Senator Susan Collins of Maine , with those of unyielding conservatives such as Senator Ted Cruz of Texas , who following the election said Republicans should press their advantage as hard as possible .Mr. McConnell will also have to contend with the competing interests of Mr. Cruz and at least two other Republican senators expected to run for president  Rand Paul of Kentucky and Marco Rubio of Florida  and those of senators up for re-election in 2016 in swing states like Illinois , New Hampshire , Pennsylvania and Wisconsin .As for legislation , the partys leaders in Congress are eying five major priorities:ENERGY Approving the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada could be fertile ground for agreement with Democrats who have differed with the White House on the issue . Combining the pipeline with new energy exports , expanded exploration and added efficiency could result in a bipartisan consensus on energy policy .On a conference call last week , Speaker John A. Boehner assured his members that he was prepared to move quickly , along with Mitch McConnell , to make clear that the new Congress will be about jobs and the economy ,  according to an official familiar with the speakers remarks .Im talking about bills to green-light construction of the Keystone pipeline and increase exports of American-made liquefied natural gas ; to restore the 40-hour workweek for American workers that was undone by Obamacare ; to encourage American employers to hire more of our veterans ,  Mr. Boehner said , according to the official .BUDGET AND SPENDING Republican leaders in both the House and Senate say that reaching a deal on a budget will be crucial not only to prove that they can do it , but also to allow conservatives to put their imprint on a nonbinding fiscal plan .Senator Jeff Sessions , the conservative Alabama Republican who will lead the Budget Committee , has had his staff looking at federal spending for months to find places to cut in hopes of proposing a budget that would be balanced in as little as a decade . But despite wide sentiment among Republicans for cuts , a divide exists within the party .Some Republicans would like to reverse a series of Pentagon spending constraints put in place through earlier budget deals with Democrats , arguing that the military is being strained at a time when it is being required to fight the continuing threat of Islamic terrorism in the Middle East . Mr . Sessions has expressed reservations about easing the spending limits on the Pentagon , and doing so would make balancing the budget harder and require even more to be cut from politically sensitive social programs .But reaching a budget deal is also essential to putting in place a set of procedural shortcuts that would allow Republicans to force through changes in the health care law and a tax package on a simple majority vote , avoiding the threat of a Democratic filibuster .If they can enact a budget , Republicans hope to return to reviewing what traditionally have been 12 separate annual spending bills and reinvigorating a process that has all but collapsed by putting the bills on the floor and allowing senators to amend them .In March , for the first time since Mr. Obama took office , Republicans will also have to find a way to pass an increase in the debt limit as the majority party  a difficult task given that the debt limit has become such a lightning rod for conservatives who object to any increase in federal borrowing power . Mr. McConnell suggested on Wednesday that Republicans would address the debt limit in the budget .TAXES A sweeping overhaul of the entire tax code is another top priority for the new majority , one that at least in theory has some Democratic support . And much of the spadework has already been done  at the Treasury Department , the House Ways and Means Committee , which is likely to be led by Paul D. Ryan , Republican of Wisconsin , and the Senate Finance Committee , which will now have Senator Orrin G. Hatch , Republican of Utah , as its chairman . Mr. Hatch will replace Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon , a Democrat who is also a tax overhaul advocate and could be instrumental in the debate .The key to a deal will be the Obama administration . Treasury officials have already developed a detailed plan to simplify the corporate tax code and lower the corporate tax rate to 28 percent from 35 percent . Republicans want it closer to 25 percent and have repeatedly said any tax overhaul must include reductions in the individual tax rates , which apply to many small businesses . It looms as a difficult negotiation , but it is possible Mr. Obama could take a page from President Ronald Reagan , who worked with Democrats to pass the 1986 Tax Reform Act .HEALTH CARE It is a delicate topic , but top Republicans acknowledge they can not repeal the Affordable Care Act , particularly with Mr. Obama able to veto any such effort . They will no doubt take some repeal votes , but their initial focus could be on smaller changes .For instance , a medical device tax used to pay for the law is opposed by lawmakers from both parties who represent manufacturers , and a repeal of the tax could pass Congress . And another group of Republicans and Democrats has also called for returning the health laws definition of full-time work to 40 hours from 30 , arguing that the lower limit is forcing too many people out of work because of employers efforts to comply with the law . Mr. Boehner singled out that measure as one that he would like to see advance .TRADE This is one area where the Obama administration and Republicans have a good chance of finding common ground . Republicans are enthusiastic advocates of increased trade , and the president is eager to get the added authority to negotiate new trade deals and win approval of a trade agreement with nations on the Pacific Rim . The main obstacle could be Democrats , many of whom are skeptical of trade deals that labor warns could cost American jobs . But a significant segment of Democrats back trade expansion , and a deal could probably be found if both congressional Republicans and the White House both press for it .Over all , those on both sides of the aisle agree that the change in Senate control presents a chance to curb the gridlock that has consumed Congress , but it also holds peril for Republicans if they fail to deliver .They have a golden opportunity ,  Mr. Manchin , the Democratic senator from West Virginia , said . If they get that and fail miserably , it is very bleak for them in 2016."
1	"Gov . Sean Parnell on Friday rejected calls to expand Medicaid in Alaska , citing cost concerns and prompting an outcry from critics who say the decision will leave thousands of Alaskans without care . Mr. Parnell , a Republican , said he believes a costly Medicaid expansion , especially on top of the broken Obamacare system , is a hot mess. The governor faced pressure from health , advocacy and business organizations to expand Medicaid under the federal health care law . For states that do , on Jan. 1 the federal law will increase Medicaid eligibility to those making up to 138 percent of the federal poverty line , which in Alaska would be about $ 19,800 . The federal government is expected to cover the cost for the first three years , through 2016 , and the bulk of the cost indefinitely , with the states contributing . Studies have suggested that 26,000 to 40,000 people would have benefited ."
1	"Greg Sargent finds Marco Rubio trying to redefine the nature of budget blackmail , declaring that its not about Republicans threatening to shut down the government unless Obama defunds heath reform ; its about Obama threatening to shut down the government unless he gets to implement the law . No , really . Rubio:I think the real question is : Is Barack Obama willing to shut down the government over ObamaCare ? In essence , I think we should pay our military . I think we should fund the government . I just dont think we should fund ObamaCare . And what the President is saying is we either fund ObamaCare or we dont fund anything . And I think thats an unreasonable position . And thats the position hes taken and the Democrats have taken .So , where have I heard that before ?

1	"HARRISBURG Pennsylvania ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obamas plan to extend health coverage to millions of poor Americans remains highly contentious , yet it is gaining momentum among several initially reluctant states where financial pragmatism is trumping ideology .Up to a dozen states , including several led by Republicans , could move forward with plans to expand coverage under Medicaid after the November elections . They take their cue from Pennsylvania and other states that have won Washington 's approval to add commercial innovations to the 50-year-old government program to make it more palatable to conservatives .Obama 's original idea of using tax money to expand Medicaid has long been a hot button for Republicans who portray the whole Obamacare healthcare overhaul as a form of socialism encroaching on American values of free enterprise and self-reliance . Texas Governor Rick Perry once said expanding Medicaid would be similar to `` adding a thousand people to the Titanic.But two things have led to a change of heart for some Republican politicians .Most of the 27 states that are already expanding the program have begun to reap billions in federal subsidies for insurers , hospitals and healthcare providers , putting politicians elsewhere under intense pressure to follow suit .As demonstrated by Pennsylvania 's deal with Washington , the Obama administration has also proved willing to accept tweaks that give the private sector a greater role in providing healthcare and place new responsibilities on beneficiaries .All of that has got as many as nine states talking to the administration about potential expansion terms , with the possibility of up to three more joining the fray depending on November 's election outcomes . As a result , there could be even more pressure on Republican states that have opted out , providing critical mass for an initiative central to Obamacare .Heading into the final two years of his presidency , Obama wants to cement his legacy , a big part of which is his pledge to reduce the number of uninsured Americans .NEW WAVEPennsylvanias the leading edge of what could be a new wave of expanding states ,  said Deborah Bachrach , a Medicaid expert at the law and consulting firm Manatt , Phelps & Phillips .This would marginalize the non-expansion states to the considerable detriment of their citizens and put pressure on those who oppose expansion ,  she said .Some states with Republican governors , such as Indiana , are negotiating with Washington for agreements that could pass political muster with conservatives back home . Others such as North Carolina , South Dakota and Wyoming are exploring options .In Florida , Wisconsin and Maine , the outcome of the Nov. 4 election could bring a shift on Medicaid if Democrats win gubernatorial races there .Administration officials have said they are committed to working with all states to expand the scheme and noted that the number of the uninsured has declined much more in states that have expanded Medicaid coverage .A possible new wave of expansion comes as prospects for the broad Obamacare reform are also looking up . After a rocky start a year ago , research suggests that more than 10 million people have gained health coverage under the law .But that momentum could get lost if Republicans win control of the U.S. Senate and begin pressuring Obama to scale back the reform .Pennsylvania 's turbulent journey into the Medicaid fold offers a possible template for others , including the possibility of a political reversal if Republican Governor Tom Corbett loses his reelection bid . In polls , he is well behind Democratic challenger Tom Wolf , who favors expanding Medicaid and keeping its traditional structure intact .Corbett , who took part in a Supreme Court challenge to the Medicaid expansion , had opposed enlarging a government program without substantial change . A pro-Medicaid coalition of more than 100 groups responded with intense lobbying during the budget approval process in early 2013 .We had advocacy days , drive-ins , invited lawmakers in to talk about whats important , encouraged people to talk to their local chambers of commerce and organized educational opportunities ,  said Paula Bussard , policy chief at the Hospital & Healthsystem Association of Pennsylvania , which represents 250 institutions .A study by the RAND Corp predicted a $ 3 billion economic boost and the creation of 35,000 jobs  big advantages for a state that has struggled for decades to make up for jobs lost from the decline of the coal and steel industries.Corbett met in Washington with former U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius in April 2013 and a year of intensive talks followed .Pennsylvania won approval for only a handful of the two dozen innovations it sought , such as permission to offer benefits through private insurers and impose premium charges on beneficiaries who earn more than the federal poverty level .The program will also include incentives for beneficiaries to practice healthy behavior including screenings and set benefit packages according to commercial standards .Pennsylvania officials say that while a compromise proved possible , that did not mean convergence in political positions .The administration comes from a different philosophical background ,  said Jennifer Branstetter , Corbetts policy chief . They want to make sure that the programs there for everybody . And we want to make sure its there if you need it . ''Other Republican-led states hope the Obama administration will allow even greater flexibility .The hope is that they 'll be less interested in the purity of their original vision and be more interested in cutting deals to get some of these things done , '' said Tony Venhuizen , spokesman for South Dakotas Republican Governor Dennis Daugaard , who has been open to a Medicaid expansion .In some states , pro-expansion politicians are trying to win conservative support by pushing market-based innovations that over time could trim the cost of traditional Medicaid .`` Eventually , they could meld together , '' said Nebraska Senator Kathy Campbell , a Republican who has helped lead discussions with Washington .But while the turning tide on Medicaid bodes well for Obamacare , Republicans refuse to concede any points in the ideological battle around the healthcare model .( Reporting by David Morgan ; Editing by Caren Bohan and Tomasz Janowski )"
1	"HIAWASSEE , Ga.  Towns County , set in a spectacular corner of the Blue Ridge Mountains of north Georgia , is extremely rugged terrain for Democrats . The last Democratic president it supported was Jimmy Carter , and Mitt Romney won 79 percent of the vote two years ago . But last week Michelle Nunn , the Democratic candidate for Senate , drew an overflow crowd at a big park pavilion here and left it cheering . The effectiveness of her appeal has been one of this seasons biggest surprises .Ms. Nunn seems to have figured out that what Southern Democrats and centrists really want goes beyond specific policy demands . Her platform is the usual mix for a Southern Democrat , combining party-line liberalism  higher minimum wage , equal pay for women , universal pre-K , immigration reform  with more conservative promises like a balanced budget , building the Keystone XL pipeline and cutting regulations . But the core of her campaign message speaks to a yearning for a pre-Tea Party era when members of the two parties still talked to each other , bargained , compromised and managed to work things out with a minimum of vituperation .That era was never quite as cheerful or productive as it is now nostalgically depicted , and it is unlikely to reappear anytime soon . But its return has been conjured up as a real possibility by Ms. Nunn , in part because it is personified by her father , former Senator Sam Nunn , whose pro-military centrism is remembered with affection here .Mr. Nunn , looking trim and vigorous at 76 , campaigned with his daughter here , and she repeatedly invoked him as the inspiration for the kind of senator she hopes to be .I carry the family values that I learned from my own father ,  she told the crowd , contrasting him with Senator Ted Cruz of Texas , who campaigned last week with her Republican opponent , David Perdue .Ted Cruz !  she said , drawing immediate boos . Hes the architect of shutting down the government . Hes a perfect example of the dysfunction in Washington , and we dont need any more of that . What we need is people to come together and sit around tables like this and get things done that matter in the lives of people.This pitch , delivered swiftly but with a light Georgia drawl , has kept her a few points ahead of Mr. Perdue in the polls in a very close race , and could reverse the long exile of Georgia Democrats from the Senate and major statewide office . She has been helped , too , by the nature of Mr. Perdues hyperpartisan campaign , which rests almost entirely on linking Ms. Nunn to the failed presidency of Barack Obama in every speech and most ads .She supports Obamacare ,  Mr. Perdue said as a point of attack at a recent debate . But when he announced , immediately after winning the primary , that I will prosecute the failed record of the last six years of Barack Obama ,  he gave Ms. Nunn a talking point she uses at every stop .We have enough prosecutors in the other party ,  she said here . What we could use is a few more problem-solvers.Mr. Perdues biggest vulnerability is his record as a chief executive of several major companies . In a 2005 deposition that someone leaked to Politico this month , he admitted that he spent most of his career outsourcing . That essentially meant sending American jobs overseas to cut costs . The Nunn campaign put out a powerful ad featuring several of the nearly 8,000 workers who lost their jobs when Pillowtex , a North Carolina textile company that Mr. Perdue ran , went bankrupt while he walked away with $ 1.7 million .Ms. Nunn , by contrast , has run several nonprofit groups , most recently the Points of Light organization , which she frequently notes was founded by President George Bush .In an interview , she said she was convinced her background would help her find common ground with less partisan Republican senators like Johnny Isakson of Georgia and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee .But even moderate Republicans dont run on promises to compromise with Democrats . If she becomes one of the rare Deep South Democrats in the Senate , she may find fewer hands reaching back across the aisle than she imagined ."
1	"HUNTERSVILLE , N.C.  The crowd that swamped a recent GOP candidates ' forum at a suburban Charlotte sports bar testified to Republicans ' hopes of defeating North Carolina 's first-term Democratic senator and moving closer to controlling the U.S. Senate .After years of voting Republican for presidents and Democratic for governors , North Carolina now rivals Ohio as a toss-up . No state plays a bigger role this year in whether Democrats will hold their Senate majority . And no Democratic senator has drawn more attack ads than Kay Hagan .She 's trying to stop a four-year Republican surge that turned North Carolina 's government sharply rightward and dealt President Barack Obama his only 2012 defeat in a fully contested state .As in many places , Republicans want to focus the campaign overwhelmingly on Obama and his health care overhaul . Without waiting for Republican voters to pick a nominee from a crowded field , a conservative group has spent nearly $ 6 million attacking Hagan for supporting the national health care law .`` This is the most toxic issue I 've seen in my political life , '' says Sen. Richard Burr , R-N.C. , who entered Congress 19 years ago . He predicts the health law  and Obama 's overall unpopularity  will sink Hagan , a lawyer and state legislator who seemingly came from nowhere to oust GOP Sen. Elizabeth Dole six years ago .Burr and many other well-established Republicans support Thom Tillis in the May 6 primary . He 's the North Carolina House speaker , and a corporate consultant from the Charlotte area .Battling Tillis , however , are feisty leaders of the tea party and conservative Christian movements . Sen. Rand Paul , R-Ky. , has endorsed one , and former Arkansas Gov . Mike Huckabee has endorsed the other .Tillis has more money and a better organization . But Democrats hope the others can hold him below 40 percent in the primary . That would force a runoff in which Tillis might be battered , and possibly beaten , by anti-establishment enthusiasm .`` You 've got the Republican civil war playing out right here , '' says Raleigh Democratic activist Thomas Mills . `` You 've got your tea partyers , your Christian conservatives and your bankers and country clubbers . ''After 20 years of enduring Democratic governors and a mostly Democratic legislature , North Carolina Republicans took total control of the government in the 2010 and 2012 elections . They poured pent-up energies into slashing taxes , spending and unemployment benefits , curbing Islamic `` sharia law '' and limiting abortion . Their new voting requirements  among the nation 's strictest  are most likely to affect poor and minority voters , who mainly vote Democratic .The changes shocked North Carolina liberals and many moderates accustomed to a more balanced brand of conservatism , notwithstanding Jesse Helms ' 30-year Senate career . North Carolina , they said , is n't South Carolina .Obama made southern history in 2008 , ending long GOP-win streaks in North Carolina and Virginia . Some people feel Hagan rode his coattails , but she won by a much larger margin .Virginia has kept narrowly trending Democratic . Democrats now hold the state 's governorship , state Senate and both U.S. Senate seats .North Carolina , however , shifted right again . After huge state GOP victories in 2010 , Mitt Romney bested Obama in 2012 . Republican Pat McCrory was easily elected governor when the Democratic incumbent did n't run .In North Carolina , `` 2008 was an aberration , '' said GOP consultant Marc Rotterman . `` North Carolina is a center-right state , '' he said , and most voters are content with the GOP-led legislature 's work .`` The problem for Hagan , '' Rotterman said , `` is Obamcare is an albatross around her neck . ''Like fellow Democratic senators in Arkansas and Louisiana , Hagan is trying to limit the law 's damage , including the discredited claim that almost everyone could keep insurance policies they liked . She says she quickly called for inquiries into the botched computer enrollments .Hagan says Republicans want to repeal the law without providing an alternative , letting insurers once again reject policy-seekers with pre-existing medical conditions . As for the attack ads , she said in an interview , billionaire conservatives from other states `` are trying to buy this election , '' which `` is not for sale . ''Establishment Republicans including prominent fundraiser Karl Rove see Tillis , 53 , as the sensible , pro-business type of conservative that North Carolinians like . But Democrats say Tillis is hardly distinguishable from his more openly ideological rivals .Tillis is following a front-runner 's strategy in the primary , focusing on raising money and skipping candidate forums .Both he and Hagan are cautious around reporters . In a 10-minute interview in his Raleigh office , Tillis said he thought the October federal government shutdown  triggered by House conservatives demanding more spending cuts  `` was well-intentioned but poorly executed . ''Tillis rejected Hagan 's complaints about a Republican-driven $ 500 million cut in state education spending . North Carolina 's GOP legislators inherited a large structural deficit , he said , and `` now we 're seeing the benefits of the tough decisions we made , '' in the form of job growth .In an earlier Associated Press interview , Tillis said he `` showcased the tea party and the principles as one of the things that we need to focus on '' when he became House speaker . As for his tea party and conservative Christian rivals , he said , `` to a large extent they 're talking about doing what we 've been doing . ''Such talk does n't satisfy tea party activist Greg Brannon , an obstetrician from Cary , N.C. , and Charlotte minister Mark Harris . They are Tillis ' top rivals for the nomination .They joined another contender , former Army nurse Heather Grant , at the Huntersville forum . It drew more than 100 people to a spot near Tillis ' home . An empty chair labeled `` Thom Tillis '' mocked his absence .Republicans taunt Hagan for sticking to Senate business in Washington when Obama recently visited Raleigh .Hagan declined to say whether she would campaign with Obama . However , she said , `` I welcome the president to come to North Carolina anytime . ''Republicans say they welcome him too .___Associated Press writer Gary Robertson in Raleigh contributed to this report ."
1	"Has anyone else noticed how much the GOP position on Obamacare resembles the classic borscht belt joke about the two ladies at a Catskills resort ? Lady # 1 : The food here is so terrible , its inedible !  Lady # 2 : And the portions are so small !  Republican # 1 : Obamacare is slavery !  Republican # 2 : And its so hard to sign up ! "
1	"Have you been following the news about Obamacare ? The Affordable Care Act has receded from the front page , but information about how its going keeps coming in  and almost all the news is good . Indeed , health reform has been on a roll ever since March , when it became clear that enrollment would surpass expectations despite the teething problems of the federal website .Whats interesting about this success story is that it has been accompanied at every step by cries of impending disaster . At this point , by my reckoning , the enemies of health reform are 0 for 6 . That is , they made at least six distinct predictions about how Obamacare would fail  every one of which turned out to be wrong .To err is human ,  wrote Seneca . To persist is diabolical. Everyone makes incorrect predictions . But to be that consistently , grossly wrong takes special effort . So whats this all about ?Many readers wont be surprised by the answer : Its about politics and ideology , not analysis . But while this observation isnt particularly startling , its worth pointing out just how completely ideology has trumped evidence in the health policy debate .And Im not just talking about the politicians ; Im talking about the wonks . Its remarkable how many supposed experts on health care made claims about Obamacare that were clearly unsupportable . For example , remember rate shock ? Last fall , when we got our first information about insurance premiums , conservative health care analysts raced to claim that consumers were facing a huge increase in their expenses . It was obvious , even at the time , that these claims were misleading ; we now know that the great majority of Americans buying insurance through the new exchanges are getting coverage quite cheaply .Or remember claims that young people wouldnt sign up , so that Obamacare would experience a death spiral of surging costs and shrinking enrollment ? Its not happening : a new survey by Gallup finds both that a lot of people have gained insurance through the program and that the age mix of the new enrollees looks pretty good .What was especially odd about the incessant predictions of health-reform disaster was that we already knew , or should have known , that a program along the lines of the Affordable Care Act was likely to work . Obamacare was closely modeled on Romneycare , which has been working in Massachusetts since 2006 , and it bears a strong family resemblance to successful systems abroad , for example in Switzerland . Why should the system have been unworkable for America ?But a firm conviction that the government cant do anything useful  a dogmatic belief in public-sector incompetence  is now a central part of American conservatism , and the incompetence dogma has evidently made rational analysis of policy issues impossible .It wasnt always thus . If you go back two decades , to the last great fight over health reform , conservatives seem to have been relatively clearheaded about the policy prospects , albeit deeply cynical . For example , William Kristols famous 1993 memo urging Republicans to kill the Clinton health plan warned explicitly that Clintoncare , if implemented , might well be perceived as successful , which would , in turn , strike a punishing blow against Republican claims to defend the middle class by restraining government. So it was crucial to make sure that reform never happened . In effect , Mr. Kristol was telling insiders that tales of government incompetence are something you peddle to voters to get them to support tax cuts and deregulation , not something you necessarily believe yourself .But that was before conservatives had fully retreated into their own intellectual universe . Fox News didnt exist yet ; policy analysts at right-wing think tanks had often begun their careers in relatively nonpolitical jobs . It was still possible to entertain the notion that reality wasnt what you wanted it to be .Its different now . Its hard to think of anyone on the American right who even considered the possibility that Obamacare might work , or at any rate who was willing to admit that possibility in public . Instead , even the supposed experts kept peddling improbable tales of looming disaster long after their chance of actually stopping health reform was past , and they peddled these tales not just to the rubes but to each other .And lets be clear : While it has been funny watching the right-wing cling to its delusions about health reform , its also scary . After all , these people retain considerable ability to engage in policy mischief , and one of these days they may regain the White House . And you really , really dont want people who reject facts they dont like in that position . I mean , they might do unthinkable things , like starting a war for no good reason . Oh , wait ."
1	"Health care as a necessity comes only after food , shelter and income security . The mismanagement of the website HealthCare.gov and the cancellation of millions of policies pushes an underlying question out into the open : Is the federal government capable of managing the provision of a fundamental service through an extraordinarily complex system ?This system requires coordination of over 288 policy options ( an average of eight insurers are competing for business in 36 states ) , each with three or more levels of coverage , while simultaneously calculating beneficiary income , tax credit eligibility , subsidy levels , deductibles , not to mention protecting applicant privacy , insuring web security and managing a host of other data points .A malfunction at any one of these junctures could prove fatal .In enacting the Affordable Care Act , President Obama and his Democratic supporters in Congress took on the task of creating a set of information technologies that has to interconnect with the I.R.S . ; the Departments of Labor , Treasury , Veterans Affairs and Homeland Security ; the Social Security administration ; state governments ; insurers ; employers ; hospitals ; and practitioners in the private sector .Robert Charette , president of the ITABHI Corporation  a tech firm specializing in risk management  describes the problems:HealthCare.gov is a huge system of systems and its extremely difficult to manage these things even in the best of times . Thats mostly because you have so many different interfaces with so many different assumptions controlling how the individual systems operate . And theyre rarely built with enough flexibility to be used by lots of other systems . If you take a look at the IRS systems , the Department of Homeland Security systems , or any of the other ones were talking about , they were never created to be connected to something like HealthCare.gov.The seven million people officials initially estimated would sign up for the Obamacare insurance exchanges this year are putting their well-being and that of their families in the hands of government bureaucracies armed with demonstrably inadequate technological expertise.The chaos surrounding efforts to activate HealthCare.gov reinforces a key conservative meme : that whatever the test is , government will fail it . Insofar as voters experience their interaction with government as frustrating and unreliable , the brunt of political damage will hit Democrats , both as the party of government and as the party of Obamacare.Cumulatively , recent developments surrounding the rollout of Obamacare strengthen the most damaging conservative portrayals of liberalism and of big government  that on one hand government is too much a part of our lives , too invasive , too big , too scary , too regulatory , too in your face , and on the other hand it is incompetent , bureaucratic and expropriatory .In addition , the Affordable Care Act can be construed as a transfer of benefits from Medicare , which serves an overwhelmingly white population of the elderly  77 percent of recipients are white  to Obamacare , which will serve a population that is 54.7 percent minority. Over 10 years , according to the Congressional Budget Office , the Affordable Care Act cuts $ 455 billion from the Medicare budget in order to help pay for Obamacare .Those who think that a critical mass of white voters has moved past its resistance to programs shifting tax dollars and other resources from the middle class to poorer minorities merely need to look at the election of 2010 , which demonstrated how readily this resistance can be used politically . The passage of the A.C.A . that year forced such issues to the fore , and Republicans swept the House and state houses across the country . The programs current difficulties have the clear potential to replay events of 2010 in 2014 and possibly 2016 .The dysfunctional A.C.A . portal is not the only liability for Obamacare.In some states , insurance companies operating through new health care state exchanges are excluding key hospitals from coverage . In New Hampshire , for example , as Jonathan Weisman of The Times reported , there is one provider , Anthem Blue Cross , and it has excluded 10 of the states 26 hospitals from participation in the companys coverage .Responding to an email , Drew Altman , the president and C.E.O . of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation , wrote of the A.C.A . :I think the bottom line here is that the winners greatly outnumber the losers in general and in the individual market in Obamacare , but the media and political math is different from the actual math . A significant minority of losers or self-perceived losers and a few high profile bad outcomes ( possibly NH ) are more than enough to cause real political problems.According to Robert J. Blendon , a professor at Harvards School of Public Health , the New Hampshire type of problem is more endemic:This is the next big political story . The president promised people they could keep their doctor and implicitly their hospital . A number of state exchanges are like New Hampshire in that they are offering what are called narrow network plans . Some of these plans exclude coverage at childrens hospitals as well , which means some parents with sick children will have to change their source of care . This too is not what was promised.In the state of Washington , the Seattle Childrens Hospital was initially left off the list of approved care providers by five of the seven insurers operating in Kings County through the state exchange , Healthplanfinder . The hospital was forced to sue state officials in order to gain eligibility .Obama and his party 's elected officials not only have the elections of 2014 and 2016 to worry about , but also the future prospects of the liberal agenda writ large , which had appeared to be slowly gaining momentum before the Obamacare portal snafu ."
1	"Heres a useful resource for tracking the history of the ideas embodied in the Affordable Care Act .The essence of Obamacare , as of Romneycare , is a three-legged stool of regulation and subsidies : community rating requiring insurers to make the same policies available to everyone regardless of health status ; an individual mandate , requiring everyone to purchase insurance , so that healthy people dont opt out ; and subsidies to keep insurance affordable for those with lower incomes .The original Heritage plan from 1989 had all these features .These days , Heritage strives mightily to deny the obvious ; it picks at essentially minor differences between what it used to advocate and the plan Democrats actually passed , and tries to make them seem like a big deal . But this is disinformation . The essential features of the ACA  above all , the mandate  are ideas Republicans used to support ."

1	"How many Americans know how health reform is going ? For that matter , how many people in the news media are following the positive developments ?I suspect that the answer to the first question is Not many ,  while the answer to the second is Possibly even fewer ,  for reasons Ill get to later . And if Im right , its a remarkable thing  an immense policy success is improving the lives of millions of Americans , but its largely slipping under the radar .How is that possible ? Think relentless negativity without accountability . The Affordable Care Act has faced nonstop attacks from partisans and right-wing media , with mainstream news also tending to harp on the acts troubles . Many of the attacks have involved predictions of disaster , none of which have come true . But absence of disaster doesnt make a compelling headline , and the people who falsely predicted doom just keep coming back with dire new warnings .Consider , in particular , the impact of Obamacare on the number of Americans without health insurance . The initial debacle of the federal website produced much glee on the right and many negative reports from the mainstream press as well ; at the beginning of 2014 , many reports confidently asserted that first-year enrollments would fall far short of White House projections .Then came the remarkable late surge in enrollment . Did the pessimists face tough questions about why they got it so wrong ? Of course not . Instead , the same people just came out with a mix of conspiracy theories and new predictions of doom . The administration was cooking the books ,  said Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming ; people who signed up wouldnt actually pay their premiums , declared an array of experts ; more people were losing insurance than gaining it , declared Senator Ted Cruz of Texas .But the great majority of those who signed up did indeed pay up , and we now have multiple independent surveys  from Gallup , the Urban Institute and the Commonwealth Fund  all showing a sharp reduction in the number of uninsured Americans since last fall .Ive been seeing some claims on the right that the dramatic reduction in the number of uninsured was caused by economic recovery , not health reform ( so now conservatives are praising the Obama economy ? ) . But thats pretty lame , and also demonstrably wrong .For one thing , the decline is too sharp to be explained by what is at best a modest improvement in the employment picture . For another , that Urban Institute survey shows a striking difference between the experience in states that expanded Medicaid  which are also , in general , states that have done their best to make health care reform work  and those that refused to let the federal government cover their poor . Sure enough , the decline in uninsured residents has been three times as large in Medicaid-expansion states as in Medicaid-expansion rejecters . Its not the economy ; its the policy , stupid .What about the cost ? Last year there were many claims about rate shock from soaring insurance premiums . But last month the Department of Health and Human Services reported that among those receiving federal subsidies  the great majority of those signing up  the average net premium was only $ 82 a month .Yes , there are losers from Obamacare . If youre young , healthy , and affluent enough that you dont qualify for a subsidy ( and dont get insurance from your employer ) , your premium probably did rise . And if youre rich enough to pay the extra taxes that finance those subsidies , you have taken a financial hit . But its telling that even reforms opponents arent trying to highlight these stories . Instead , they keep looking for older , sicker , middle-class victims , and keep failing to find them .Oh , and according to Commonwealth , the overwhelming majority of the newly insured , including 74 percent of Republicans , are satisfied with their coverage .You might ask why , if health reform is going so well , it continues to poll badly . Its crucial , Id argue , to realize that Obamacare , by design , by and large doesnt affect Americans who already have good insurance . As a result , many peoples views are shaped by the mainly negative coverage in the news media . Still , the latest tracking survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation shows that a rising number of Americans are hearing about reform from family and friends , which means that theyre starting to hear from the programs beneficiaries .And as I suggested earlier , people in the media  especially elite pundits  may be the last to hear the good news , simply because theyre in a socioeconomic bracket in which people generally have good coverage .For the less fortunate , however , the Affordable Care Act has already made a big positive difference . The usual suspects will keep crying failure , but the truth is that health reform is  gasp !  working ."

1	"I fairly often receive mail pleading with me to take a more even tone , to have a respectful discussion with people on the other side rather than calling them fools and knaves . And you know , I do when I can . But the truth is that on most of the big issues confronting us , there just isnt anyone to have a serious discussion with . Ezra Klein offers a nice illustration of this point today , in his takedown of Avik Roy on Obamacare in California .The thing you want to bear in mind is that Roy is widely considered a good example of a reformist conservative , not to mention a health policy wonk . So what does this reform-minded wonk have to say about Obamacare ?Klein tries really hard to keep his temper even ; too hard , I think , because I wonder how many readers will stay with him all the way through . But to cut to the chase , Roy claims that Obamacare will cause soaring insurance rates , using a comparison that is completely fraudulent  and I say fraudulent , not wrong , because he is indeed enough of a policy wonk here to know that he is pulling a fast one .So heres the comparison Roy uses : he points out that the insurance premiums that will apparently be charged on the California exchange will be higher than the lowest rates being offered by some insurers in California right now .As Klein says , this isnt just comparing apples and oranges ; its comparing apples with oranges you cant even buy .Right now , California has a basically unregulated individual market , in which insurers are free to reject whoever they choose , and charge whatever rates they choose . This means that a few young , healthy people with no record of prior medical problems can get cheap plans ; these are , of course , precisely the people who need insurance least , and these plans are cheap not just because theyre only available to the very healthy but because they dont provide much insurance . If youre not healthy or wealthy enough to get by with this kind of insurance , too bad .So looking at these rates tells you nothing at all about the success of a program that offers insurance to everyone , regardless of medical history , and sets fairly high minimum standards for the quality of that insurance .Whats more , this isnt some obscure issue . When people try to explain the logic of ObamaRomneyCare  certainly when I try to explain it  they often start from precisely this point , pointing out that unregulated insurance markets give the healthy and wealthy a pretty good deal but leave everyone else out in the cold , then work from that point toward the three-legged stool of community rating , mandates , and subsidies that supports reform . So Roy has to know that hes making an essentially fraudulent argument  and does it anyway .And Roy is about as good as you get in this stuff : his tone is even , he actually knows something . Nonetheless , he goes for the cheap , misleading shot .I know that a lot of people wish we lived in a country where debates about things like health care policy were serious , honest discussions of debatable points . I like to hope that by the time I retire Ill actually live in a country like that . But right now , and surely for years to come , its basically facts versus fraud ."
1	"I havent been writing about the healthcare.gov thing , for the simple reason that I have nothing to say . Whats going on isnt a policy question : we know from the states with working exchanges ( including California ) that the underlying structure of the law is workable . Instead , its about an implementation botch , which is an incredible mess , and reflects very badly on Obama . But the future of the reform depends not on policy per se but on whether the IT issues can be fixed well enough soon enough , a subject on which I have zero expertise .Of course , that hasnt stopped other people from breathlessly commenting on every twist and turn in the polls , every meaningless vote in the House , and so on . Hey , its a living .But at this point theres enough information coming in to make semi-educated guesses  and it looks to me as if this thing is probably going to stumble through to the finish line . State-run enrollments are mostly going pretty well ; Medicaid expansion is going very well ( and its expanding even in states that have rejected the expansion , because more people are learning theyre eligible . ) And healthcare.gov , while still pretty bad , is starting to look as if it will be good enough in a few weeks for large numbers of people to sign up , either through the exchanges or directly with insurers .If all this is right , by the time open enrollment ends in March , millions of previously uninsured Americans will in fact have received coverage under the law , and reform will be irreversible . Obama personally may never recover his reputation ; Democratic hopes of a wave election in 2014 are probably gone , although you never know . But anyone counting on Obamacare to collapse is probably making a very bad bet ."
1	"I know youre worried about the government shutting down on Oct. 1. Who wouldnt be ? Services suspended , the nations credibility damaged in the eyes of the rest of the world . What serious person would want to let that happen ?Hehehehe .The better to plan your watchful worry , heres a tentative schedule of events:Monday , Sept. 23 : Senate goes into session to consider the House bill that couples funding for the government with defunding Obamacare .House is on vacation . Im serious .Wednesday , Sept. 25 : House comes back from vacation . Early . So stop carping .Thursday , Sept. 26 : Senate is working its way toward a vote on the bill . Whoops ! Somebody just objected to something . May take a little while longer .Friday , Sept. 27 : The House takes up a bill to raise the debt ceiling , thus allowing the government to continue paying its bills . Which is tied to defunding Obamacare , and construction of the Keystone XL pipeline .Saturday , Sept. 28 : The entire planet says : Keystone pipeline ? Sunday , Sept. 29 : Maybe a day or two before , but around here  the Senate strips the Obamacare part from the bill funding the government , passes the bill and sends it back to the House .Sept. 30 : Last minute ! Clock is ticking !Oct. 1 : Best-case scenario  the House passes the bill in the wee small hours of the morning . Everyone breathes a sigh of relief and moves on to the question of whether the governments ability to pay its debts should hinge on the construction of an oil pipe to the Gulf Coast .One thing at a time . About keeping the government running : In the end , itll all be up to the House Republicans  pass a clean bill or dig in their heels and turn off the lights . At that point , House Republicans must stand firm , hold their ground , and continue to listen to the American people ,  said Senator Ted Cruz of Texas .House leaders were less than thrilled with his advice . It was sort of like a guy who left the Alamo at the last minute , yelling Victory or Death !  as he galloped out of sight . Some people believe that Cruz is behind everything crazy going on in Washington right now . This is possibly true , if you work under the reasonable assumption that everything that happens in the world is based on a movie plot .THE CALGARIAN CANDIDATEDuring the Bush administration , agents of the Democratic Party hatch a long-term plot to ensure political ascendancy in the 21st century . Their secret tool : a Canadian-born Texas lawyer who they kidnap and brainwash . The mole  we will call him T.  suddenly emerges out of political obscurity in 2012 , propelled into the U.S. Senate by members of the Texas Republican Party who have also been secretly hypnotized by the Democratic operatives . The only sign of their transformation is a compulsion to say T . is the kindest , bravest , warmest , most wonderful human being Ive ever known in my life over and over again .By the next year , Democrats decide they want to force the Congressional Republicans to behave with breathtaking irresponsibility . Time to pull the trigger ! While T. is standing alone at a Washington costume party , he is approached by a beautiful woman dressed as the Second Amendment . And then ...Actually , the House Republicans have plenty of Tea Party patriots who are perfectly capable of being crazy all by themselves . Representative Ted Yoho of Florida told The Timess Ashley Parker and Jonathan Weisman that he was ready to stick to his guns : It only takes one with passion  look at Rosa Parks , Lech Walesa , Martin Luther King.I am mentioning this partly because it isnt often you hear someone equate eliminating health insurance for the poor with Rosa Parks . Also because I like to write Representative Ted Yoho.The bill the House sent to the Senate on Friday doesnt even make much sense . The defund Obamacare part looks as though it was written by squirrels . If it became law , Obamacare would actually continue to exist . At most , the administration would be crippled in their early efforts to get younger uninsured Americans to sign up for health coverage . ( This would presumably give the opposition more time to run those ads that show a young woman being given a pelvic exam by a monster Uncle Sam doll . ) And , meanwhile , the popular Childrens Health Insurance Program would be thrown into chaos , as well as payments to doctors who treat Medicare patients .But what the heck . No sacrifice is too great when the cause is convincing young adults that they shouldnt buy health coverage .Its an intense moment , even by current political standards . When the Republicans met in conference on Friday , Politico reported , Representative Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania compared John Boehner to Jesus : I dont want this to be like Palm Sunday , where we bring the speaker in on a little donkey and then next Friday , we crucify him.I know , Im having a hard time getting the image out of my mind , too ."
1	"I wrote yesterday about the remarkable way in which not just policies , not just policy ideas , but even the notion of who is a policy expert have been seemingly unaffected by the debacles of the past few years . Today John Taylor offers , unintentionally , a perfect example .Actually , before I get there , a word about self-styled conservative market monetarists : guys , have you noticed who your real policy enemies are ? People like me , Brad DeLong , etc . are skeptical about the Feds ability to offset the effects of fiscal austerity , but we do want it to try . The furious academic opposition to quantitative easing is instead coming from moderate conservative macroeconomists , notably Taylor and Feldstein . So your problem isnt just that the GOPs effective leader on economic issues gets his macro from Francisco DAnconia ; its that even the not-so-silly wing of the party is dead set against what you consider reform .But back to Taylor today ; its another denunciation of quantitative easing . And while Taylor does cite Paul Volcker , who deserves immense respect for past achievements , his main source is  Allan Meltzer . This is the same Allan Meltzer who has been predicting runaway inflation for more than four years , who responded to the failure of any of that to materialize , not by considering the possibility that his analysis was wrong , but that there must be something strange going on . Why , it must be the fault of Obamacare !I dont know what more Meltzer could have done to demonstrate that he has no idea how monetary policy works in a liquidity trap . Yet he hasnt changed his views , still considers himself an expert , and is still treated as such .Incidentally , the Robert Samuelson article in which Meltzer blamed Obamacare for the failure of his inflation predictions also quotes Lorenzo Bini Smaghi at length . I happen to have been part of a group that , sometime in 2010 , received a long lecture from Bini Smaghi about how critics of the Greek plan were just ignorant , and failed to understand how well it was going to work . Ahem ."
1	"IN last weeks column , I wrote about what might happen if the new health care laws Web site remained a festering technological sore for months to come . ( The answer : Nothing good . ) But its still more likely that HealthCare.gov will be fixed by Thanksgiving and millions of Americans will ( finally ) be able to get a real look at what Obamacare is selling them .What will they find ? One way to understand what is being offered is to think in terms of three mores. Insurance  la Obamacare will be more expensive , more subsidized and more comprehensive than what was previously available on the individual market .This may not be obvious if youre struggling to log on to HealthCare.gov . But some of the state-level exchange Web sites are working well enough to enable illuminating window shopping .Take the exchange in my native state , Connecticut . There the more expensive part of the new regime is readily apparent . If you look at Connecticut insurance prices for 2013  that is , pre-Obamacare  on the online clearinghouse eHealthInsurance , monthly premiums for a 30-year-old in good health can start below $ 100 , and under $ 300 for a healthy 60-year-old .On the states new Obamacare-compliant health care exchange , by contrast , nothing is that cheap . The lowest priced ( bronze ) plan for a 30-year-old Connecticut resident has premiums starting at $ 224 a month ; for a 60-year-old , the cheapest plan starts at $ 537 .These premium increases , however , dont tell the whole story , because there are subsidies , which the Connecticut exchange helpfully calculates as well . If our hypothetical 30-year-old makes $ 30,000 a year , for instance , he or she would be eligible for credits that lower the actual cost of the cheapest plan to $ 115 a month . A hypothetical 60-year-old making $ 30,000 would see the cost of the cheapest bronze plan fall to zero . Over all , the premium increases only really bite as subsidies phase out  at incomes above $ 45,000 , or about $ 62,000 for a family of four .They bite , in part , because insurance companies now have to take customers with pre-existing conditions , which drives everyones rates up . But they also bite because buyers are getting more insurance than the older systems cheapest plans offered .Take those low-cost 2013 plans I mentioned above . A typical one  teased at $ 269 a month for a nonsmoking 60-year-old Connecticut man  comes with a $ 5,000 deductible , an annual out-of-pocket limit of $ 12,500 , and all kinds of copays and coverage restrictions .With some grandfathered exceptions , Obamacare makes those kinds of plans illegal . The out-of-pocket limit for individuals is capped at $ 6,500 a year , preventive services are fully covered , and various essential benefits as well .If we ever get beyond the follies of HealthCare.gov , the politics of the rollout will probably be defined by how ( and how vocally ) middle-class Americans just above the subsidy threshold react to this pay more , get more , subsidize other people deal .Some of them will be buying for the first time , spurred by the mandates penalties ; many others will be shopping for a new plan because their previous ones no longer meet Obamacares requirements . Will they be grateful for more comprehensive coverage , even though its being forced on them and has higher premiums attached ? Or will they feel they were misled by the presidents if you like your insurance plan , you will keep it rhetoric , and drive a further backlash against the law in 2014 and beyond ?Where the underlying policy debate is concerned , meanwhile , what you think about the three mores basically determines whether you belong on the left or on the right . To liberals , more is simply better , and the disappearing low-cost plans deserve to vanish , because they left purchasers potentially exposed to way too much financial risk . ( Even the new bronze plans are really too stingy in this view  which is probably why , if you qualify for subsidies , the Connecticut Web site deliberately nudges you toward the pricier silver plans . )Conservatives agree that these cheaper plans create more risk . But they also create a sensitivity to price  and with it , a curb on cost growth  thats rare in a system where third-party payment has made prices opaque , arbitrary and inflated . And for a society that pretty clearly spends far too much on health care , sticking with catastrophic coverage frees up money  thousands for individuals and families , billions for the government  to spend on something other than the insurance-medical complex .Yes , for some that money would ultimately get eaten up , and then some , by unexpected bills . But for others it might be money saved for retirement , money that pays for child care , money used to hire a contractor or buy a house . And for the public sector , it would be money for all the priorities  liberal as well as conservative  that are being undercut by rising health care costs .This is why the laws critics believe Obamacare might be a long-term failure even if it survives its launch troubles and works on its own terms for a while . Its not about the good things the reform delivers : those are real enough . Its about whether there are too many other goods , for too many people , that the laws three mores end up crowding out ."
1	"INDIAN ROCKS BEACH , Florida  The November midterm elections are more than eight months away , but a battle for an open congressional seat in Florida has become a high-stakes test of a crucial question for the fall : how the Republican assault on President Barack Obama 's healthcare overhaul will play at the polls .The race to succeed the late Republican Bill Young in a March 11 special election will not dramatically alter the balance of power in Congress , where Democrats face an uphill battle in November to gain the 17 seats they need to reclaim a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives .Even so , both parties and their big-money backers see the race on the Sunshine State 's Gulf Coast between Republican David Jolly and Democrat Alex Sink as a harbinger of the November 4 elections - a test of voter enthusiasm for campaign themes , ad messages and fundraising appeals .That is why voters in the St. Petersburg area have been bombarded in recent weeks by more than $ 5 million worth of television and radio ads , mailings and automated calls from the candidates and interest groups attacking or defending the healthcare law popularly known as Obamacare .Such spending is extraordinary for a special congressional contest in which the winner will have to run again in November , when the entire 435-seat House will be up for election .A victory by Sink , 65 , a former chief financial officer for the state who narrowly lost a bid for Florida governor in 2010 , could help reassure nervous Democrats that they will be able to neutralize Republican attacks on Obamacare this fall .Jolly , 41 , is a former aide to Young who has been a lobbyist for the past seven years . A win for him in the politically divided district , which Obama narrowly carried in the 2012 presidential election , would be a morale boost for Republicans and signal that their targeting of Obamacare is resonating with voters .`` We 're the testing ground this year , '' said Susan MacManus , a political science professor at the University of South Florida in Tampa . `` Both sides are watching very closely to see how their messages play with voters . ''With approval ratings for Obama and his healthcare law below 50 percent nationwide , Jolly and Republicans have tied Sink to the president and reminded voters of her support for Obamacare , a program designed to help millions of uninsured and underinsured Americans get private health coverage .Republicans say the program is too costly , kills jobs and robs many Americans of healthcare choices . Those arguments have been a constant theme in Republican ads against Sink .Jolly , who favors repealing the law , also has questioned Sink 's commitment to the district , which she moved into last year from neighboring Hillsborough County . Sink lost to Republican Rick Scott by 1 percentage point in the race for governor in 2010 , and Jolly has cast her as an ambitious politician with little interest in Pinellas County .`` Pinellas needs someone to look out for our interests , not President Obama 's , '' Jolly says in one campaign video .Another ad from the National Republican Congressional Committee features images of Sink , Obama and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi .`` Alex Sink 's loyalty is to them , not Florida , '' the narrator says . `` Why else would she continue to support Obamacare ? '''NOT A BILL YOUNG REPUBLICAN 'Sink has countered by attacking Jolly 's work as a lobbyist in Washington and linking him to the conservative Tea Party movement , labeling him an extremist who would threaten Social Security spending . That argument typically plays well in a state that is one of the United States ' retirement havens .Sink 's strategy reflects a tactic Democrats have signaled they will employ in the fall : emphasize the value of Obamacare and other social programs , and remind voters of Republican divisions between compromise-resistant Tea Party conservatives and the party 's more moderate establishment .Jolly calls himself a `` Bill Young Republican , '' invoking the name of the respected moderate who represented the area in Congress for 43 years until his death last year . Sink suggests his views are more in line with Tea Party candidates who she says are far right of America 's political mainstream .Sink , a former banker , also brushed off the idea she is new to the area and says she has done business there for decades . During a visit to a local retirement center , she told residents about working to open the first bank branch at the center .`` I 'm no stranger to Pinellas County , I 've been working here for 25 years , '' she said in an interview in her spartan headquarters in Clearwater . `` I can relate to the issues of seniors , protecting Social Security and Medicare . ''She has criticized Jolly for working as a lobbyist in Washington , including work he did for a client who favored privatizing Social Security . That issue could be key in next month 's election , in which analysts say nearly half of the voters are likely to be at or near retirement age .Jolly says he does not support privatization . `` She has completely fabricated this , '' he said of Sink , acknowledging that the ads against him have been `` effective but wrong . ''`` They spent a million dollars calling me a Washington lobbyist , and they went out and polled and realized they had wasted a million dollars calling me a lobbyist . So now she is playing the extremist card , '' Jolly said .GROUPS SPENDING MILLIONSOutside groups have rushed in to help both sides , spending $ 5.4 million so far . More than $ 3.4 million of that has been spent on Jolly 's behalf , according to figures compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics .The National Republican Congressional Committee has led the spending for Jolly with nearly $ 1.6 million . Other backers include groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , the National Rifle Association and American Crossroads , the group led by former George W. Bush aide Karl Rove .The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has led the charge for Sink , spending nearly $ 1 million on her behalf .The result has been a wave of campaign ads and mailings that has dismayed many residents .`` This local election has just been taken over by outside forces , '' said Kathy Krohn , a Clearwater geologist . `` I hope people still turn out to vote . ''Jolly acknowledged feeling guilty about the ad blitz while meeting with voters this week in Indian Rocks Beach near St. Petersburg . `` You 've seen the commercials . So I 'll start by saying I 'm David Jolly , and I apologize for one more message . '''WE CA N'T GO BACK 'Sink has fought back against Jolly 's Obamacare ads by saying she backed the initial effort to broaden access to healthcare and that any problems with the law should be fixed , rather than used to justify killing the entire law .`` We ca n't go back to where we were . It 's not perfect , so let 's fix it , '' Sink said of the law through which more than 3 million Americans so far have gotten health coverage .Jolly says he would replace Obamacare with measures that would preserve popular parts of the law , such as those preventing people with pre-existing medical conditions from being denied coverage and allowing children up to age 26 to stay on their parents ' health plans .A recent poll by the Tampa Bay Times newspaper found more than two-thirds of each candidates ' supporters said Obamacare was an important factor in determining their support .`` Sink is a very smart woman , but I 'm saddened that she wants Obamacare . It 's ruined our economy , '' said Barbara Koyutis , a real estate agent in Seminole . `` She is just doing what the Democrats want her to do . ''But Bettye Strickland of Largo , a retired state employee who favors Sink , said Obamacare has too many benefits to repeal it .`` She wants to fix what 's wrong with it , not destroy it , and that seems like a smarter approach , '' Strickland said , adding that `` I just tune all of the ( campaign ) ads out . You have to . ''( Editing by David Lindsey and Jonathan Oatis )"

1	"If House Republicans want to fray the Affordable Care Act on the eve of its implementation , defunding it wont work . Theyd be better off stripping or delaying the individual mandate .Thats the conclusion of two recent studies that speak to one of the many moving pieces in this falls vicious budget debate .House Republicans last week passed a bill that would keep on financing the federal government , but not the Affordable Care Act . Specifically , the bill orders : Notwithstanding any other provision of law , no federal funds shall be made available to carry out any provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or a related law . It also retracts the entitlement to benefits  that is , the Medicaid expansion  in the law .If the Senate , with a Democratic majority , passed the bill from the Republican-controlled House as is , the law would be shot . There would be no federal money for the state exchanges , or to cover low-income adults in Medicaid . But theres no way the Senate would pass the House bill . Even if it did , President Obama has vowed a veto .Rather , any defunding would be temporary , because of a government shutdown . On the day the exchanges were due to open , much of the federal government would go offline , including a big portion of the Health and Human Services Department that is running the coverage expansion . But legislative inaction can not gut Obamacare in the way that legislative action could . During a shutdown , implementation would substantially continue .Thats according to a Congressional Research Service report prepared for Senator Tom Coburn , an Oklahoma Republican . In no small part , the reason is that much of the Affordable Care Acts financing comes from mandatory spending , rather than discretionary spending , and a continuing resolution concerns only the latter . Moreover , some of the laws money comes from multiyear or no-year discretionary funds that do not get wrapped up in the continuing-resolution process either . The Health and Human Services Department says its reform implementation fund would not get touched by a lapse in appropriations .That is not to say that a shutdown , especially a long one , would not throw a wrench in health care reform or other programs financed with mandatory money . The Congressional Research Service report , for instance , looks at what happened to Medicare during the shutdowns in 1995 and 1996 . It continued to pay doctors and hospitals . But its financing for its claims-processing vendors came from the discretionary budget . During the shutdown , those vendors kept working with only the expectation that they would get paid later . And during a long shutdown , claims payments might cease as vendors ran out of cash to cover their operating costs ,  the research service report says .Temporary defunding probably would not do much . But Congress could substantially mar the law by stripping or delaying the tax penalties on Americans who decline to buy insurance  the so-called individual mandate. And it is one tactic that Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio is mulling .A new Urban Institute study explains why . Using Congressional Budget Office figures , it shows that delaying the individual mandate for a year would reduce coverage by about 11 million people in 2014 . That would save the government some money . However , the effect on the health insurance marketplace might be profound . Many young and healthy people would decline to buy insurance coverage , with no penalty . The pool of the insured would be relatively sicker . Insurers would be forced to increase rates , as the healthy would do less to cross-subsidize the ill . Premiums would shoot up .Heres the institute on the multibillion-dollar problems that might create:There is significant risk that low exchange enrollment in the first year due to the lack of a mandate could begin an adverse selection cycle which would make it difficult to establish viable risk pools in the exchange in future years . While the Urban Institute estimated that premiums without the mandate could be up to 24 percent higher than with the mandate , that analysis assumed fully effective risk adjustment across the exchange and nonexchange markets . Less effective risk adjustment could lead to even higher premiums in the exchange without the mandate and could dissuade insurers from participating in the new markets ; this could then further dissuade healthier individuals with current nongroup coverage from entering the exchanges , exacerbating the effect in the following years .In short , even a one-year delay in the mandate might cause cost problems throughout the insurance market  and from the perspective of the laws supporters , that might be a lot worse than hassles related to a temporary shutdown ."
1	"If Republicans are in control of both houses of Congress next year  which is looking probable two weeks before the elections  House Speaker John A. Boehner and the Senate Republican leader , Mitch McConnell , could use some guidance from North Carolina : Dont overreach .As of now , in a race that could go either way , the incumbent senator , Kay Hagan , a Democrat , is a slight favorite over the Republican Thom Tillis for one reason : The challenger is speaker of the states Republican-led House of Representatives , which is about as unpopular in North Carolina as Congress .The Hagan campaign calculates it offsets any national tide favoring Republicans by linking Mr. Tillis to the partys rule in Raleigh , the state capital . The senator always refers to her opponent as Speaker Tillis , not Mr. Tillis , Thom Tillis or Tillis . That might be a credential in some states . Not North Carolina .Previously , Republicans were salivating over their prospects in the state . Mr. Tillis turned back right-wing primary challengers and was the strongest general-election candidate . Allies including the Koch brothers and Karl Roves group spent millions assailing , and presumably softening up , Ms. Hagan .But Mr. Tillis is haunted by the unpopular record of the Republicans who control state government . They slashed taxes , especially for the affluent ; cut social services ; prevented the expansion of Medicaid for poor people ; alienated womens rights activists and enacted measures making it harder to vote that principally affected black and young voters .Republicans say Mr. Tillis has finally gotten his footing and is competitive , maybe even a point or two ahead ; private Democratic polling shows a steady advantage for Ms. Hagan of about three points .The Republican candidate passes up no opportunity to link Ms. Hagan to President Barack Obama , whose favorability in the state is about five points below his mediocre national rating . Obamacare , the scandal over substandard care for veterans and gridlock in Washington are portrayed as Obama-Hagan messes .Last week , the Tillis campaign was playing up the role of the president and the Democratic senator in the rise of Islamic State and the handling of a potential Ebola epidemic . Senator Hagan has to be held accountable ,  Mr. Tillis said in an interview in Goldsboro . She has not pounded the table at the Obama incompetence.Similar criticism has been leveled at Democrats elsewhere . But Ms. Hagan has an advantage : She can use Mr. Tilliss unpopular record as fodder for attacks by linking him to the state governments decisions to defund Planned Parenthood , reject pay equity for women , refuse Medicaid expansion and cut voting opportunities . These issues energize the Democratic base , women and minorities . The conflict is most heated on the topic of education , a top issue this year in North Carolina . Mr. Tillis claims Democrats are falsely accusing him of cutting funding for schools , which he says has increased . Democrats say funding didnt keep up with population growth and inflation , so the amount allotted was a reduction .This may be the most expensive race per voter in the United States , with a final tally , counting spending by outside groups , of as much as $ 100 million . With both sides flush , money probably wont be a determining factor .What is critical for Ms. Hagan  Democrats must win this race to have a shot at retaining their Senate majority  is the so-called ground game : the voter identification and turnout effort . Democrats , who report theyll have 10,000 volunteers , are optimistic , especially when it comes to the black community , agitated by Republican action in state government .Republicans say that victory depends on holding the libertarian candidate , a pizza deliveryman who drains more support from Mr. Tillis , to under 5 percent of the vote . Ultimately , though , this race will probably be decided by whether voters on Election Day are thinking about their distaste for Mr. Obama and Washington or their negative feelings about Republicans and Raleigh ."
1	"If only Id checked with you first , Times readers , I could have expanded my list of fallacies about the Affordable Care Act . Thanks to your comments and emails on my column , Ive noted a few more enduring myths that seem worthy of debunking . See below .But first , let me field a bit of incoming flak .An astute reader took issue with my statement that the law will deliver 30 million new customers to the private insurance industry. In fact , some of those 30 million will be poor enough to qualify for Medicaid , and will not end up in the private market . How many ? Because the same Supreme Court case that approved the mandate also allowed states to opt out of expanded Medicaid , its impossible to say . Estimates were that if the states had to participate , roughly half of the 30 million would qualify for Medicaid , but under the Supreme Court ruling the number is likely to be far fewer . ( Were publishing a correction on the 30 million . ) But my point stands that the law , although it imposes new rules on insurers , is not a federal takeover of health insurance . For better or worse , it preserves our private insurance industry and requires that millions of additional customers buy their products .On the job-killer front , I heard from a number of small businessmen who insisted the new law would prevent them from hiring more workers if it increased their payroll to more than 50 employees . Under Obamacare , companies with more than 50 workers are obliged to provide health insurance or pay an annual fine of $ 2,000 per excess worker beyond the first 30roughly a dollar per hour for a full-time employee . I appreciate the visceral reluctance to take on additional costs and paperwork , and can imagine marginal cases where a small company would decide its not worthwhile to grow . But Im skeptical that many savvy businessmen would turn down a good opportunity to expand simply to avoid offering workers health insurance . If the value of the new business is greater than the employers share of an insurance plan or a fine , you go for it , right ? Thats called capitalism .Two other reasons the arguments that Obamacare is a job-killer dont add up:1 . Although small-business lobbies tend not to mention it , businesses with fewer than 25 employees that already offer health insurance will be eligible for new tax credits ; that will free up money for investment .2 . The increased access to health care will create new jobs in the health care industry itself . As Harvard health economist Katherine Baicker has cautioned , expanding the health care sector should not be a goal of reform ; its more important to get the existing system working more efficiently . But providing access to systematic primary care for 30 million newcomers is bound to create new demand , not just for doctors and nurses but ( as Jonathan Gruber of MIT has written ) for assistants and technicians and support staff  precisely the sort of medium-skill jobs that our economy desperately needs. For these and other reasons , most economists who have studied the likely impact on employment say it will be quite small .There is considerableand healthydoubt about how well the Affordable Care Act will accomplish its second major aim , aside from expanding coverage : slowing the raging growth of health care spending . I agree that it will require real vigilance and oversight , and probably some fixes to the law , if Obamacare is to , as the saying goes , bend the cost curve downward . It will require moving more doctors from fee-per-service to salaries , more collaborative care , better electronic sharing of patient information , better controls on in-hospital infections . ( Reforms of medical malpractice law , an issue Obamacare skirted , would help , too . ) The Affordable Care Act takes first steps towards controlling the costs of our bloated system , but they are only first steps .Now , the myths , continued .Myth # 6 : Unions that supported Obama dont have to comply with Obamacare . This allegation , repeated by several readers , harkens back to an anti-Obamacare ad by a Republican campaign group . The website PolitiFact skewered it last year . Briefly , one important provision of the new law forbids insurers from putting a cap of less than $ 750,000 on the care a person can get in one year . Some companies argued that if they complied right away , they would have to raise premiums on their workers or stop offering insurance altogether . To prevent that , the Obama administration government has granted waivers to companies ( and unions ) allowing them to keep the more limited insurance plans in place until 2014 . Politifact said the waivers have been granted to both companies and unions , with no pattern of special treatment .Myth # 7 : Obamacare creates a secretive board of bureaucrats with power to cut off grandpas dialysis or grandmas chemotherapy . You dont hear the phrase death panels much any more , but variations of that fallacy persist , like sightings of Sasquatch . The new law establishes an Independent Payment Advisory Board of health care professionals to propose ways to curb the growth of Medicare spending . It operates in public and makes systemic recommendations , which Congress can overrule . The board can reduce the amount Medicare pays health care providers for services and propose innovations to cut waste . It has no say in the treatment of any individual ; it can not change eligibility for Medicare , reduce benefits or raise premiums .Myth # 8 : Obamacare is a distraction from the main issue , which is jobs . This is the flip side of Myth # 1 , that Obamacare is a job-killer . You hear critics , right and left , saying that Obama took his eye off the ballthe economywhen he set out to push the health care act through Congress . TV anchors are constantly showing us polling results in which voters identify issues that matter most to them , with health care ranking a distant second or third to the economy or jobs. The implication is that health insurance is a side issue , unworthy of so much attention . But health insurance is inseparable from the larger discussion , both as a matter of economics and as a matter of psychology . Containing the cost of health care is integral to the fate of our economy . And the current dependency on employers for health insurance contributes mightily to the fear of losing a job ."
1	"Image taken down by requestI suggested yesterday that were probably heading for a turning point in the health reform discussion . Conservatives are operating on the assumption that its an irredeemable disaster that they can ride all the way to 2016 ; but the facts on the ground are getting better by the day , and Obamacare will turn into a Benghazi-type affair where Republicans are screaming about a scandal nobody else cares about .And its already starting to happen .White House officials are sounding increasingly upbeat . They could be deluded or spinning ; but after what happened two months ago one suspects that the last thing they want is to inflate expectations unduly .Meanwhile , media coverage is shifting fast . Its still mostly trying for equivalence  each positive story of people being helped matched by a negative story of people hurt . But the stories dont actually match up at all .Small example : earlier today I found myself trapped in a place with CNN on in the background , showing a fair-and-balanced account of losers and winners . First , the loser : a guy who admits that Obamacare has gotten him a plan cheaper than the insurance he had , but who has found that his current allergist is off-network . Annoying , no doubt ; but there are other allergists , and this particular one probably didnt help the case by saying that hes thinking of refusing to take Medicare patients , too .And in any case , insurance with restricted networks is hardly something new to Obamacare .Then , the winners : a couple with no insurance at all , because her premium would have been prohibitive and he has a preexisting condition that wont let him buy any kind of insurance at all  but now both covered , at a very affordable price , by Covered California .I dont know about you , but these dont sound to me like equivalent stories .At this rate , the whole horrors-of-Obamacare meme will be gone in weeks , not months . But the GOP echo chamber wont be able to let it go ."
1	"Imagine you are President Obama . You have about two more years in office , but your agenda is dead on arrival in the Republican-controlled Congress that takes over in January . What do you do ?One obvious strategy is to search for areas of common ground . However , the prospects for resolving existing stalemates in Washington on issues like immigration reform are unclear ( though deals on trade or tax reform are under discussion ) .Instead , Mr. Obama may seek to bring new issues into the conversation . Thats what he did Monday when he called on the Federal Communications Commission to promote net neutrality ,  which would prevent preferential treatment of content online by Internet providers . The statement was seen as an effort to influence forthcoming rules from the commission , which is headed by an Obama appointee but operates independently .However , the Presidents increasingly public embrace of net neutrality ( which he has supported since his 2008 campaign ) could come at a significant cost . Though Congress is already divided along party lines on the issue , Mr. Obamas advocacy could strengthen Republican opposition to the issue .Presidential position-taking on issues like net neutrality can polarize sentiment in Congress . For instance , Ted Cruz , a Republican senator and a possible 2016 presidential contender , quickly condemned net neutrality as Obamacare for the Internet. Mr. Cruzs negative reaction was echoed by House Speaker John Boehner and Mitch McConnell , who will become the Senate majority leader in January .President Obama may instead hope to go outside Congress , mobilizing sentiment like that expressed by Matthew Inman on the popular Internet cartoon The Oatmeal , or the comedian John Oliver , whose previous segment on the issue has attracted millions of views on YouTube .But efforts to mobilize the public on the issue are unlikely to succeed , as the political scientist Phil Arena noted on Twitter . Many Americans dont know what net neutrality is or understand the debate over the issue . Thats why polling shows variable support depending on how the questions are framed . As people get increasingly partisan cues  Mr. Obama is for it , Republicans are against it  they are likely to follow their preferred party , which will further strengthen the partisan divide on the issue .Mr. Obamas best hope is that his advocacy will pressure the F.C.C . to take a more aggressive approach . Even then , however , the commission answers more to Congress , which controls its budget and the laws under which it operates than to the president , as Edward Wyatt noted in The New York Times on Monday . With Republicans growing in strength on Capitol Hill , they might devote more legislative effort to opposing F.C.C . rule-making on the issue , restrict funding , or use other tools to hinder the agency , countering Mr. Obama . Already , congressional Republicans have issued a letter challenging the F.C.C . 's authority on this issue and scheduled an oversight hearing in the House .If the G.O.P . embraces opposition to net neutrality as part of its agenda , Mr. Obamas party may come to see the downside of the bully pulpit that so many have demanded that he use ."
1	"Imagine you decide to replace the engine of a car . You have two goals : To make the car go faster , you put in a more powerful engine , say eight cylinders rather than six . But you also want to make it more fuel efficient , so you add some sophisticated new technologies to cut back on its gas guzzling .But this is untested technology , so you dont have any idea which of these changes will prove to have a greater impact . Will the car consume more fuel because it is has become more powerful ? Or will the fuel efficiency improvements be effective enough that it uses less fuel despite the bigger engine . You wont find out until you take the car for a drive .And that , in a nutshell , is why we have no idea how quickly the American economy is growing this year .The United States has overhauled its health care system , which accounts for one-sixth of the engine of the economy . But President Obamas health reform legislation has two sets of goals . It aims to expand health coverage to millions of Americans without insurance . And it aims to make the American health care system more efficient , to force doctors and hospitals to deliver care in a more cost-effective way .As it turns out , the question of which of those efforts is more successful will have an outsize impact on the overall growth rate of the economy . That was one of the big lessons from new revisions to gross domestic product data earlier this week , which showed a surprise drop in health care spending ; earlier releases of the first-quarter data showed a large gain . That swing was a major reason the economy shrank at a 2.9 percent annual rate in the first three months of the year , its worst performance in five years .But what it really shows is how the implementation of health reform is going to cloud our understanding of the economy for some time to come .In normal times , health spending is the boring part of the G.D.P . report . It almost always grows : The first-quarter contraction was only the fourth quarterly decline in the last 80 quarters ( thats going back to 1994 ) . Health spending reduced overall G.D.P . growth by only 0.16 of a percentage point . That isnt that much in the scheme of things , but it was the most the health sector had subtracted from overall growth since the start of 1982 .In other words , when economy-watchers  analysts , journalists and others  parse the quarterly economic reports , health care is usually part of the boring backdrop while we focus on sexier sectors that show more volatility , like capital expenditures by businesses . ( As an aside , the fact that we consider trends in business equipment spending to be sexy is a reason you may not want to invite an economics reporter to your next cocktail party ) .But until the dust settles from Obamacare implementation , that has changed . The uncertainty around how the health law will affect spending patterns means that we may be in a period where quarter-to-quarter volatility in economic growth is driven by the micro details of how the health insurance law is working on the ground , rather than any broad momentum ( or lack thereof ) in the economy .What should we be rooting for ? This is an area where what is good for the country in the short run is at odds with what is good in the long run . It would be great to see a stronger recovery from the last recession , the kind of 4 or 5 percent growth that would put Americans back to work in a big way .But the United States also has the most expensive health care system in the world , without producing better health outcomes . If the nation succeeds at reducing health care costs while also getting coverage for more people , it will be a huge win for the countrys long-term competitiveness . Over time , the dollars that arent being spent on overpriced or unneeded health services can go to other stuff that makes lives better : houses , college education , restaurant meals and the like .The frustrating thing is that if that adjustment continues , it will do so while the economy is still far from full employment . Thats what happened in the first quarter : Health spending fell ( yay ! ) , but nothing else rose to take its place ( boo ! ) . It implies that we need to start seeing stronger growth in everything else to achieve robust growth even as the adjustment in the health care sector plays out ."
1	"In December 2012 , 56 percent of Americans approved of President Obamas leadership . About 40 percent disapproved .Today , those numbers are almost precisely reversed , a fact that Democrats were made keenly aware of in the fall campaign and in the midterm elections .The publics confidence is gone , and it doesnt seem to be coming back ,  says Ross Douthat at The New York Times .So what happened ?Mr. Douthat offers not a unified theory but four partial ones : Republican intransigence , an incomplete economic recovery from the Great Recession , Obamacare and foreign policy crises .Indeed , partial theories are popular among observers , and many land on similar issues . In an account of Obamas second term , Juliet Eilperin and David Nakamura , writing at The Washington Post , detail what amounts to a war of attrition between the White House and Congress , with each side blaming the other for a lack of progress on legislation of any kind .What all the parties had to show for it , after multiple failures on policy and a government shutdown , was nothing but disapproval , The Post reporters write : The presidents approval ratings took a nose dive , and Congresss were even worse.For Andrew Sullivan at The Dish , a fanatically obstructionist and increasingly extreme GOP wanted to undermine the president with a strategy hatched privately before Obama even took office.They judged early on that the real promise of Obama  his ambition to transcend the old politics in favor of pragmatic reform  could be killed if they simply refused to play along ,  Mr. Sullivan writes .On the economy , Peter Foster at The Telegraph says : Since Mr. Obama took office facing the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression , unemployment has fallen from 10 percent to 6 percent and American businesses have created 10 million new jobs  thats more than Japan , Europe and every other advanced economy combined.Problem is , he adds , many of those jobs are McJobs  that is , low-paid and part-time work that dont leave people feeling better off. On top of that , in numerical terms , G.D.P . has risen by 8 percent since Mr. Obama took office , but median household incomes are down.Mr. Douthat agrees : Even with the improving employment picture this recovery is still basically a disappointment , especially for the middle class ,  and adds that it isnt necessarily a case study in the economy not mattering . Its an example of voter patience persisting for a while , and finally running out.The most persuasive answer to the question  where did Obama go wrong ?  was the botched roll-out of healthcare.gov ,  Mr. Sullivan says . No one else can be blamed for this , and it hit the presidents ratings like a ten-ton truck.Mr. Douthat points to competence as a general concern for the public with this administration and identifies the roll-out as a key moment : The health care law is Obamas signature issue , it remains largely unpopular ( even if support for full repeal is weak ) , and its initial stumbling coincided with the sharpest second-term drop in the presidents approval.Yet for Mr. Sullivan , this is only the start of the narrative : What this superficial version of events misses is what happened next . The truth is : the Obama team subsequently achieved a near-miraculous rescue of Obamacare , achieved real success in enrollment , and have seen core healthcare costs slow down in such a way that could yet shift our long-term fiscal liabilities for the better.Still , as Mr. Foster points out , Like George W. Bush after Hurricane Katrina , Mr. Obamas approval numbers never recovered from the sight of his flagship piece of legislation capsizing so ignominiously before it had even left the harbour.Mr. Douthat suggests that the president had an edge that Democratic politicians often lack : The public trusted him on foreign policy.But , he writes , one crisis after another  Syria , Ukraine , ISIS , Ebola  eroded that trust and made Obamas position irrecoverable.While acknowledging that Mr. Obamas refusal to engage in the theatrical parts of the presidency looks terrible during crises ,  Danny Vinik at The New Republic , like Mr. Sullivan , defends the president on issues like ISIS , at least on substantive grounds : Its more important that the president craft effective policy responses to crises . Obama has done that  and the media coverage has missed it completely , focusing instead on Obamas rhetorical shortcomings and downplaying his policy successes.Conor Friedersdorf at The Atlantic has an entirely different log of reasons to disapprove of Mr. Obamas performance . His list includes warrantless wiretapping , a failure to punish illegal torture , a costly and ruinous war on drugs , the unacknowledged moral costs of drone strikes , the presidents secret kill list ,  an out-of-control national-security state and the presidents persecution of whistle-blowers and journalists whove worked with them .Confronted with all of those transgressions , more than four in 10 Americans still approve of the job Obama is doing ,  Mr. Friedersdorf writes . And most of them are loyal Democrats . Partisanship and tribalism are overriding the moral compass of too many liberals.For Elias Isquith at Salon , the root of the presidents problems is not to be found in specific events or issues but in his temperament . Many moderates see Obamas penchant for working from within the system rather than trying to disrupt it as a real plus .But , he asks , was this temperamental conservatism the wrong fit for the current era , when major reforms are so desperately needed ?Mr. Isquith turns back to a 2009 Harpers article by Kevin Baker , predicting that Mr. Obama would fail , because he would be unable to seize the radical moment at hand.For Mr. Isquith , Rather than recognize how ideological and partisan realignment and polarization had effectively changed the rules of the Senate ,  the president went looking for consensus where none existed .At this point , there is no question that President Obama will fall short of initial expectations ,  Mr. Isquith says . But more than the failure to pass any one particular bill , the disappointment stems from the presidents dogged insistence on being a reformer during a radical era.But perhaps our focus on the presidency is itself skewed . The presidency is the central element in our political system , but as Aaron David Miller writes , maybe the problem is our expectation of the presidency itself .He argues at Foreign Policy ( and in his book The End of Greatness : Why America Cant Have ( and Doesnt Want ) Another Great President ) : The centrality of the presidency must be reconciled with the limitations of the office and the constraints that bind it . The presidency has always been an implausible , some might even say an impossible , job . But the following mix of challenges and constraints  some old , some new  has made the post-World War II presidency harder still : constitutional and practical constraints on the office itself ; the presidents expanding reach and responsibilities ; the expanding role of a government we trust less , even when we demand more from it ; Americas global role ; and an intrusive , omnipresent , and nonstop media.Greatness in the presidency is too rare to be relevant in our modern times and  driven as it is in our political system by big crisis  too risky and dangerous to be desirable . Our continued search for idealized presidents raises our expectations and theirs , skews presidential performance , and leads to an impossible standard that can only frustrate and disappoint . To sum up : We can no longer have a truly great president , we seldom need one , and , as irrational as it sounds , we may not want one , either.He concludes : Historic greatness in the presidency has gone the way of the dodo . And it is unlikely to return any time soon."
1	"In a rare fit of realism on Tuesday , Senator Mitch McConnell , the Republican leader , admitted he would be unable to repeal the Affordable Care Act if Republicans win the Senate next week and he becomes majority leader . That would take 60 votes , he said , and no one thinks Republicans will get that many .But conservatives reacted with anger to what they considered a demonstration of weakness , and on Thursday Mr. McConnell was forced to backtrack . Yes , his spokesman told The Washington Examiner , Mr. McConnell remains committed to the full repeal of Obamacare with only a simple majority , through a parliamentary procedure known as reconciliation .Those two comments are a pretty good indication of what life will be like in Congress if Republicans gain control of the Senate in Tuesdays election , and if Mr. McConnell wins his race in Kentucky . Its not just that they are committed to time-wasting , obstructionist promises like repeal of health care reform , which everyone knows President Obama would veto . The bigger problem is that the partys leaders have continually proved unable to resist pressure from the radical right , which may very well grow in the next session of Congress .Tea Party loyalists like Senator Ted Cruz of Texas already have far too much sway over the Republican caucus , but if they become the majority , things could become worse . The Republican Senate candidate in Iowa , Joni Ernst , wants to ban abortions and same-sex marriage and impeach the president . In Georgia , David Perdue , the Republican candidate , said his biggest task is to prosecute the failed record of the Obama administration . Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas , a three-term incumbent in a tough race for re-election , promised voters that a Republican majority means a stop to the Obama agenda.A Republican majority wouldnt really be able to reverse Mr. Obamas most significant accomplishments , but in the act of trying , it could do a great deal of damage . Mr. McConnell has already made it clear how he would proceed : He intends to attach his demands to required spending bills , forcing the president to choose between accepting Republican policies and vetoing spending bills , which could lead to shutting down all or part of the government .Those demands could take the form of riders aimed at blocking an array of environmental activities  everything from limiting carbon pollution from power plants to protecting clean water  and at repealing new consumer protections and restrictions on financial institutions . There would be no minimum-wage increase , or big investments in education , or immigration reform .Republicans would also be certain to block Mr. Obamas choices for judgeships  all but guaranteeing a judicial crisis unless the president agreed to conservative choices  as well as his executive appointments , starting with a new attorney general . Its hard to imagine a Congress less productive than this one , but obstructionism could actually get worse if a new majority took hold ."

In one case , I encountered vast amounts of paperwork , mind-numbing bureaucracy , and extremely frustrating delays . In the other , my needs were met quickly and politely .So far , then , its DMV 1 , private health system ( and I have very good insurance ) 0 ."
1	"In an ideal world , ads for congressional candidates would not look like promos for Homeland.But there they are ! Grainy shots of barbed-wire , terrorist training camps and men in Arab garb firing large weapons , overlaid with scary sound clips from cable news . ( Are they coming for us ?  )O.K. , were scared enough . We already had the Iraqi prime minister free-associating about terrorists in the subways this week . We dont need to be told that if we vote for the wrong candidate in November , its curtains .In an election year , theres certainly a lot of foreign policy to debate . Should Congress be voting on whether were going to war ? Which of the candidates think we should send American troops ? Should we really be arming Syrian rebels ?You will be stunned to hear that none of these issues are the subject of campaign ads . What were getting is stuff like:Staci Appel  Passports for Terrorists ( Iowa )Dan Maffei Puts Us at Risk ( New York )Michelle Nunns own plan says she funded organizations linked to terrorists. ( Georgia )That last one comes from Republican Senate candidate David Perdue . We dont have time here to follow the intricate , pothole-paved path that led the Perdue camp to that conclusion . But to get there you have to be prepared to believe that Points of Light , a charity founded by George H. W. Bush , has been assisting Hamas .The Republican fear-mongering has several aims . One is to remind voters that the Democratic candidate in question belongs to the same party as Barack Obama . This is totally fair . It may get boring , but it is not against the rules .Theme 2 is that Candidate X is making it easier for Americans who trained as terrorists overseas to get back into the country and blow something up .Staci Appel , a candidate for Congress in Des Moines , fell into a deep hole during a debate when her Republican opponent said that if he were in office , hed be urging our State Department to revoke the passports of people who have admitted they belong to terrorist organizations .Since urging is pretty much all members of Congress do these days , it sounds like a relatively harmless way to pass the time . However , Appel demurred , and said we need to make sure that we work through the system.Perhaps she misunderstood what he was saying . But you know what happened next . The poor woman was eventually forced to run her own ad announcing that she Supports Revoking Passports for Terrorists.Meanwhile , up in New Hampshire , Republican Senate candidate Scott Brown has been bragging that when he was last in office  during a previous incarnation as the senator from Massachusetts  he sponsored a bill to revoke the citizenship of anyone who gives aid to a terrorist group .Thats a lot different from passports . You can certainly try somebody for treason , but theres no way to just decree that an American is no longer an American . The founding fathers were very clear on that point . If you resurrected James Madison and showed him Obamacare and citizenship-stripping , I can guarantee you which one would freak him out .The most popular terrorism-connected campaign theme is overall border security , since it allows conservative candidates to roll up ISIS terrorists with illegal Hispanic immigrants . Shes for amnesty , while terrorism experts say our border breakdown could provide an entry for groups like ISIS !  announced that David Perdue ad against Michelle Nunn in Georgia . Some experts believe that even at this early hour , Perdue has wrapped up the title of Worst Commercial of the Campaign .The terrorism experts ,  by the way , are actually the Texas Department of Public Safety .Brown took up the same theme this week , lacing into both President Obama and his opponent , Senator Jeanne Shaheen , for a passive , pathetic attitude on protecting the borders .This was during his first foreign affairs speech as a candidate in New Hampshire . Shaheens campaign took the occasion to remind the world that when he was representing Massachusetts , Brown had boasted about his secret meetings with kings and queens ,  which appear to have all been fictional .Except for citizenship-revoking , Browns speech was general in the extreme . It would be great to hear some specifics .Right now the United States spends more on border security than on all the rest of its criminal law enforcement agencies combined . Under President Obama , the Department of Homeland Security has constructed nearly 650 miles of fences . The number of border patrol agents has doubled to more than 20,000 . They patrol every mile of the border every day , aided by 10 drones .When candidates announce they want to beef up border security , how much more do you think they want to spend ? Should there be an agent every 500 feet ? A line of officers holding hands from the Pacific to the Gulf of Mexico ? Inquiring minds want to know .Maybe they could put it in an ad ."
1	"In response to polling data showing that the Affordable Care Act has become more popular , a prominent Republican pollster said that he expected Republicans to change how they talked about the law .After the primaries , expect a shift in Republican candidates rhetoric against Obamacare ,  said Bill McInturff , a partner in Public Opinion Strategies . Only few want to repeal the law ,  he said of voters . Most want to fix and keep it.Mr. McInturff , speaking at the annual conference of the American Association for Public Opinion Research in Anaheim , Calif. , was referring to results from survey work his firm does with Hart Research Associates for NBC News and The Wall Street Journal .Mr. McInturff said he still believed the law would hurt Democrats in the midterm campaign . President Obamas personal ratings suffered last November after the rollout of the health-care plan . Although there has been some recovery , Mr. McInturff does not believe there will be enough time before the midterm elections to repair the damage . He added that Mr. Obamas incorrect assertion that people could keep their health-care plan if they wanted had appeared to be particularly harmful .It will take two or three years for the law to shake out ,  he said . If the law is perceived as working , it will help the Democrats ; if it is perceived as not working , the Republicans will benefit."

1	"Independent , educated and socially-progressive voters who might be persuaded to vote for the G.O.P .Discussing how best to reinvigorate the Republican party , Michael J. Petrilli argued in The Wall Street Journal:"
1	"It goes without saying that Obamacare had a disastrous rollout . But its not October any more . Enrollment is rising fast , and administration officials  who have every reason not to overpromise after what happened last time  are sounding increasingly confident .Yet as Greg Sargent notes , right-wing pundits , from Bill Kristol to the WSJ , have clearly decided that the GOP will win big in 2014 by running against the Obamacare debacle . The possibility that it might not be perceived as a debacle by November  that it might even be perceived as a qualified success  doesnt seem to figure at all in their thinking .Why the disconnect ? Well , its feeling to me a lot like the later months of the 2012 campaign , when the polls clearly pointed to an Obama win but Republicans lived in a closed information loop where such information was excluded  the only polls they heard about were unskewed to remove the unwelcome information .So right now I see a lot of analyses that take the October-November average enrollment and present it as the shape of things to come  see , enrollment is far behind the predicted pace , and its mainly Medicaid ! No acknowledgment of the reality that these numbers are weighed down by a non-functional website thats pretty functional now , that the pace has accelerated dramatically , and that experience in Massachusetts tells us to expect a surge of enrollment , especially among healthy Americans , as the deadline for avoiding the penalty approaches .Meanwhile , polling on health reform is already improving , even though a majority of voters dont yet know how much better the signup process is working .Obviously a lot of things can happen in the months ahead . But 2014 may be more like 2012 than anyone imagines ."

1	"It goes without saying that the rollout of Obamacare was an epic disaster . But what kind of disaster was it ? Was it a failure of management , messing up the initial implementation of a fundamentally sound policy ? Or was it a demonstration that the Affordable Care Act is inherently unworkable ?We know what each side of the partisan divide wants you to believe . The Obama administration is telling the public that everything will eventually be fixed , and urging Congressional Democrats to keep their nerve . Republicans , on the other hand , are declaring the program an irredeemable failure , which must be scrapped and replaced with ... well , they dont really want to replace it with anything .At a time like this , you really want a controlled experiment . What would happen if we unveiled a program that looked like Obamacare , in a place that looked like America , but with competent project management that produced a working website ?Well , your wish is granted . Ladies and gentlemen , I give you California .Now , California isnt the only place where Obamacare is looking pretty good . A number of states that are running their own online health exchanges instead of relying on HealthCare.gov are doing well . Kentuckys Kynect is a huge success ; so is Access Health CT in Connecticut . New York is doing O.K . And we shouldnt forget that Massachusetts has had an Obamacare-like program since 2006 , put into effect by a guy named Mitt Romney .California is , however , an especially useful test case . First of all , its huge : if a system can work for 38 million people , it can work for America as a whole . Also , its hard to argue that California has had any special advantages other than that of having a government that actually wants to help the uninsured . When Massachusetts put Romneycare into effect , it already had a relatively low number of uninsured residents . California , however , came into health reform with 22 percent of its nonelderly population uninsured , compared with a national average of 18 percent .Finally , the California authorities have been especially forthcoming with data tracking the progress of enrollment . And the numbers are increasingly encouraging .For one thing , enrollment is surging . At this point , more than 10,000 applications are being completed per day , putting the state well on track to meet its overall targets for 2014 coverage . Just imagine , by the way , how different press coverage would be right now if Obama officials had produced a comparable success , and around 100,000 people a day were signing up nationwide .Equally important is the information on who is enrolling . To work as planned , health reform has to produce a balanced risk pool  that is , it must sign up young , healthy Americans as well as their older , less healthy compatriots . And so far , so good : in October , 22.5 percent of California enrollees were between the ages of 18 and 34 , slightly above that groups share of the population .What we have in California , then , is a proof of concept . Yes , Obamacare is workable  in fact , done right , it works just fine .The bad news , of course , is that most Americans arent lucky enough to live in states in which Obamacare has , in fact , been done right . Theyre stuck either with HealthCare.gov or with one of the state exchanges , like Oregons , that have similar or worse problems . Will they ever get to experience successful health reform ?The answer is , probably yes . There wont be a moment when the clouds suddenly lift , but the exchanges are gradually getting better  a point inadvertently illustrated a few days ago by John Boehner , the speaker of the House . Mr. Boehner staged a publicity stunt in which he tried to sign up on the D.C. health exchange , then triumphantly posted an entry on his blog declaring that he had been unsuccessful . At the bottom of his post , however , is a postscript admitting that the health exchange had called back a few hours later ,  and that he is now enrolled .And maybe the transaction would have proceeded faster if Mr. Boehners office hadnt , according to the D.C. exchange , put its agent  who was calling to help finish the enrollment  on hold for 35 minutes , listening to lots of patriotic hold music.There will also probably be growing use of workarounds  for example , encouraging people to go directly to insurers . This will temporarily defeat one of the purposes of the exchanges , which was to make price comparisons easy , but it will be good enough as a short-term patch . And one shouldnt forget that the insurance industry has a big financial stake in the success of Obamacare , and will soon be pitching in with big efforts to sign people up .Again , Obamacares rollout was a disaster . But in California we can see what health reform will look like , beyond the glitches . And its going to work ."
1	"It has not escaped the notice of political analysts that 72 percent of whites without college degrees  a rough proxy for what we used to call the white working class  believe that the U.S. economic system generally favors the wealthy. Or that on Nov. 4 , these same men and women voted for Republican House candidates 64-34 .Similarly , the overwhelmingly white electorates of Alaska , Arkansas , Nebraska and South Dakota voted decisively in referendums to raise the minimum wage while simultaneously voting for Republicans , whose party has adamantly rejected legislation to raise the minimum wage .There is an ongoing debate among politicians , political scientists and partisans of both parties over the dismal support of Democratic candidates among whites . Does it result from ideological differences , racial animosity or a perception among many whites that they are excluded from a coalition of minorities , the poor , single women of all races , gays and other previously marginalized constituencies ?Arguably , the poor Democratic showing among whites does not represent naked race prejudice , as Obamas election and re-election attest . But it can be seen as a reflection of substantial material interests that affect the very voters who carry greater weight in low turnout midterm Congressional elections .Whites as a whole , who made up 75 percent of this years electorate , voted for Republican House candidates by a 24-point margin , 62-38 , the exact same margin by which they supported Republican candidates in the 2010 midterms . In 2006 , when opposition to President George W. Bush was intense , Republicans won white voters by eight points , 52-44 .The opposition of whites to the Democratic Party is visible not only in voting behavior , but in general opposition to key Democratic policy initiatives , most tellingly in hostility toward the Affordable Care Act . A November 2013 National Journal poll found , for example , that 58 percent of whites said Obamacare would make things worse for people like you and your family ,  more than double the 25 percent that said that Obamacare would make things better .Asked whether the Affordable Care Act would make things better or worse for the country at large , 60 percent of whites said worse and 35 percent of whites said better .Obamacare shifts health care benefits and tax burdens from upper-income Americans to lower-income Americans , and from largely white constituencies to beneficiaries disproportionately made up of racial and ethnic minorities . The program increases levies on the overwhelmingly white affluent by raising taxes on households making more than $ 250,000 .To achieve its goals , Obamacare reduces spending on Medicare by $ 500 billion over 10 years , according to the Medicare board of trustees , which oversees the finances of the program . Medicare serves a population that is 77 percent white . Even as reductions in Medicare spending fall disproportionately on white voters , the savings are being used to finance Obamacare , which includes a substantial expansion of Medicaid . Medicaid recipients are overwhelmingly poor and , in 2013 , were 41 percent white and 59 percent minority .In addition to expanding Medicaid , the overall goal of Obamacare is to provide health coverage for the uninsured , a population that , in 2010 when the program was enacted , was 47 percent white , and 53 percent black , Hispanic , Asian-American and other minorities .Its not hard to see , then , why a majority of white midterm voters withheld support from Democrats and cast their votes for Republicans .Republicans are not satisfied with winning 62 percent of the white vote . To counter the demographic growth of Democratic constituencies whose votes threaten Republican success in high-turnout presidential elections , Republicans have begun a concerted effort to rupture the partisan loyalty of the remaining white Democratic voters . Their main target is socially liberal , fiscally conservative suburbanites , the weakest reeds in the Democratic coalition . These middle-income white voters do not share the acute economic needs of so-called downscale Democratic voters and they are less reliant on government services .The Republican strategy to win over these more culturally tolerant , but still financially pressed , white voters is to continue to focus on material concerns  on anxiety about rising tax burdens , for example  while downplaying the preoccupation of many of the most visible Republicans with social , moral and cultural repression .The current effectiveness of the anti-tax strategy was demonstrated in the unexpected victory of Larry Hogan , the Republican gubernatorial candidate in deep blue Maryland , who defeated Anthony Brown , the highly favored Democratic lieutenant governor .The average Marylander sees a governor and legislature willing to impose record tax increases on the rest of us that we dont need , dont want and cant afford ,  Hogan declared at the start of his campaign and repeated relentlessly until Election Day .Hogan won by decisively carrying all the majority white suburbs surrounding Baltimore city , including Howard County , a former bastion of suburban Democratic strength .In Colorado , Cory Gardner , the Republican Senate nominee , joined the Republican assault on Obamacare and taxes:Significantly , Gardner also stiff-armed the Christian right on issues of contraception and abortion in his successful two-point win over Mark Udall , the Democratic incumbent . Gardner highlighted a more culturally tolerant approach when he endorsed over the counter access to the morning after pill  a form of contraception many in the right to life movement consider a form of abortion  and when he renounced past sponsorship of a personhood constitutional amendment titled The Life Begins at Conception Act.In a mea culpa comment rarely heard in campaigns , Gardner told The Denver Post:Despite this , not only did the Christian right stick with Gardner , but white evangelicals provided his margin of victory . These religious voters , who made up 25 percent of the Colorado midterm electorate , voted for Gardner over Udall by a resounding 70 points , 83 to 13 . This margin was enough to compensate for Udalls 20-point victory , 57 percent to 37 percent , among the remaining 75 percent of the Colorado electorate .The clear implication of these results for Republican candidates running in 2016 and beyond is that you can break with conservative orthodoxy on some issues to better appeal to a general election electorate without paying the price of losing white Christian support .If Republicans are successful in toning down their candidates , it will take from Democrats a weapon that has proved highly successful in state and federal elections : demonizing Republican Party candidates as a collection of knuckle-dragging Neanderthals .The Democrats portrayal of Republicans has served to motivate both Democratic voters and donors , especially suburban white Democrats , by tapping into their anger and fear of a morally intrusive Republican Party .Anger in politics can play a particularly vital role , motivating some people to participate in ways they might ordinarily not ,  according to Nicholas Valentino , a professor of communication studies and political science at the University of Michigan , and the lead author of Election Nights Alright for Fighting : The Role of Emotions in Political Participation ,  a 2011 study of voter motivation .A Democratic tactic designed to focus on mobilizing white voters  the sustained effort led by Senator Harry Reid to demonize the Koch brothers  has not yet , by most accounts , paid off .As they have after past Election Day defeats , Democrats can hope for Republican infighting between the establishment and Tea Party wings . Such internecine conflict , in fact , has already begun .Democrats can also count on greater voter participation by their loyalists in a presidential year , and on advantageous demographic trends : The share of the electorate held by older and working-class whites , the core of the Republican Party , diminishes every year , while Democratic constituencies continue to grow .In the aftermath of the 2012 election , the obligation to change fell upon the Republican Party . With the support of Karl Rove , the Republican National Committee , under its chairman , Reince Priebus , pulled the party to the center , with Priebus producing the famous autopsy report calling for political moderation . To the surprise of many , the partys candidates this year took key suggestions to heart .Insofar as the Republican Party successfully sandpapers its sharp edges , the necessity for change will now shift to the Democrats . Most recently , this kind of metamorphosis was accomplished by Bill Clintons 1992 Southern governors strategy presidential campaign when he defied liberal orthodoxy on such issues as welfare and the death penalty .One question presents itself : how transformative a political leader is Hillary Clinton ? Can she avoid entrapment by divisive issues of key importance to competing wings of the center-left coalition : L.G.B.T . rights ; marijuana legalization ; climate change ; gun control ; racial profiling ; fracking ; pension rights for public employee unions ; citizenship for undocumented immigrants ; and the ever pressing social welfare needs of the countrys poor ?In May 2008 , with Obama taking the lead , Hillary Clinton committed to continue the race for the nurse on her second shift , for the worker on the line , for the waitress on her feet , for the small-business owner , the farmer , the teacher , the coal miner , the trucker , the soldier , the veteran.As James Oliphant , the National Journals White House correspondent wrote:The white vote in the years since 1992 has become consistently more committed to Republican candidates . Mitt Romney carried whites by a 20-point margin , 59-39 , larger than either John McCain , 12 points , or George W. Bush , 17 points .Clinton has her work cut out for her , especially if the Republican nominee heeds the advice of party leaders and makes a concerted effort to further erode  by whatever means necessary  white Democratic support ."
1	"Its pretty clear that the implementation of Obamacare will set the tone for how Americans think about government for years to come . There are two large questions to be settled , which you might call the questions of competence and coercion .The first is whether the government is competent enough to manage large programs . Can the administration get the website to work , set rules for the right insurance products or impose efficiency measures to restrain costs ?These are still open questions . Democrats see the early messiness as the temporary teething pains inevitable to a new large enterprise . Republicans see them as the first stages in the unraveling of an unworkable Rube Goldberg machine . But the fact is that we cant yet know who is right . Over the next few years , the implementation will either go more smoothly and build faith in federal competence or go as it has been and destroy it .But were already getting a clearer answer on the question of coercion . Cast aside for a second any negative connotation to that word . Almost all large government programs , even very popular ones like Social Security , involve a degree of coercion . Government builds a system and forces everyone to operate within it .Obamacare , as originally envisioned , mandated that people join the system in order to redistribute money from the healthy and young to the sicker and older . It coerces some people to do something they might not want to do , and which , in fact , may not be in their short-term interest to do .Already , its very clear that millions of Americans  and not just Tea Party types  do not accept the legitimacy of the government to overrule individual decisions , even on something like health insurance . This is not the America of 1932 or of 1964 . This is an America steeped in distrust of government . Its an America that is , on both left and right , steeped in the ethos of individual choice . Its an America steeped in a morality of authenticity , which says that it is right to listen to the individual voice within and immoral to be forced to conform to the external commands from without .From the very first moment , people have had problems with the idea of mandates . Barack Obama beat Hillary Clinton among a Democratic primary electorate in 2008 in part because he opposed mandates . When Obamacare was still a bill , members of Congress succumbed to political pressure and lowered the penalties that would be imposed on those who violated the mandates . Then the Supreme Court majority decided the penalties werent even penalties ; they were just an optional tax .When disgruntled groups have objected to the employer and other mandates during implementation , the administration has generally loosened , delayed or suspended them . Late last week , the administration granted a hardship exemption to people who had their prior coverage canceled and who believe that the mandated Obamacare offerings are unaffordable .Most telling , the administration hasnt even made a moral argument for the mandates . It hasnt even tried to make the case that coercing some people to participate in collective action is necessary for the common good .It now seems possible that no one will be paying the mandate penalties in 2014 . Having exempted some groups from the mandate already , it will be politically difficult to start enforcing it on others . And , looking further into the future , why should we think Democrats will suddenly crack down and enforce the mandate in the run-up to the next presidential election ?This part of the law is like an unpopular , insecure person at a family reunion , who is walking on eggshells and making concessions right and left for fear of offending anybody . In the age of the Internet , people are used to decentralized systems and maximum personal choice . The mandated elements of Obamacare may look good on paper and they may be necessary to get the plan to work , but they probably cant survive the public sense they are illegitimate .Governing in an age of distrust is different than governing in an age of trust . Government now lacks the legitimacy to impose costs on losers , so politicians face unprecedented pressure to create situations in which everybody looks like winners . Government lacks the legitimacy to coerce . People like Social Security , but I bet you that Congress could not pass a Social Security law today . If people were unfamiliar with the concept , you couldnt pass a bill that said : Government is going to confiscate money from each paycheck and spend it on other things , but dont worry because youll get it back decades from now when you retire .The erosion of the mandate wont kill Obamacare over all . Itll just make it much more expensive for the government . But the larger lesson is that to sustain a program in this culture , you probably have to rely on policy mechanisms that maximize consumer-style choice , not mandates ."
1	"Its no secret that Senator John McCain doesnt much like Senator Ted Cruz , whom he once called a wacko bird. His main grievance is that Mr. Cruz isnt interested in the business of governing , which requires compromise . If Mr. Cruz cant get what he wants , hed rather muck up the Senate than give in .This character trait was on brilliant display from Tuesday until this morning . For 21 hours and 19 minutes Mr. Cruz attacked the Affordable Care Act and read from Dr. Seusss Green Eggs and Ham ,  among other time-wasting tactics , in a quasi-filibuster . ( Quasi because he wasnt actually in a position to stop Senate proceedings , as The National Journal explained . ) Democrats werent keen on the speech . Neither , for that matter , were Republicans . Mr. McCain was among those who felt Mr. Cruz was merely grandstanding , and earlier today he went so far as to suggest that Mr. Cruzs diatribe was fundamentally undemocratic .Id remind my colleagues that , in the 2012 election , Obamacare , as its called  and Ill be more polite , the A.C.A .  was a subject that was a major issue in the campaign . I campaigned all over America for two months , everywhere I could . And in every single campaign rally I said we had to repeal and replace Obamacare. Well , the people spoke . They spoke , much to my dismay , but they spoke and they re-elected the president of the United States . No that doesnt mean that we give up our efforts to try to replace and repair Obamacare . But it does mean elections have consequences and those elections were clear , in a significant majority , that the majority of the American people supported the president of the U.S. and renewed his stewardship of this country . I dont like it , its not something that I wanted the outcome to be . But I think all of us should respect the outcome of elections , which reflects the will of the people ."
1	"Its the biggest expansion of government and Washingtons biggest response to inequality in decades . So no wonder its the political story that wont die .The two serious subplots of Obamacare revolve around a new open-enrollment period and a new Supreme Court case . The open-enrollment period starts Saturday , for people who dont receive their insurance from their employer , Medicare or Medicaid . Margot Sanger-Katz , working with Kevin Quealy , developed a handy guide to the big questions about the enrollment  both for people interested in getting health insurance and for those merely interested in following the story . If our FAQs dont answer your question , let us know .Well obviously be following the open-enrollment period in other ways as well , because it will provide important clues about how well the Affordable Care Act is functioning . In a separate story this morning , Margot notes that the early signs on premiums are positive : Theyre barely rising in the major cities for which we have data so far . Elsewhere on The Upshot this week , Neil Irwin covered the controversy involving remarks by Jonathan Gruber , an economist whose ideas helped shape the law . As Neil writes , that controversy sheds light on a dirty little Washington secret .And about that Supreme Court case : Its still months away , but its a big deal . The court has announced that it will consider a challenge to the law that could cancel the subsidies that millions of people in more than 30 states receive to buy health insurance . Only four of the nine justices need to agree to accept a case , so the fact that the court took the case doesnt mean that it will cancel the subsidies . But there is little obvious reason for justices to take the case unless they want to do so .The latest attack on President Obamas health care law already seems to have four votes at the court . The question is whether it will find a fifth .This article is part of The Upshots weekly newsletter ."
1	"Im not usually interested in White House intrigue , and Im no Kremlinologist , but it does seem bizarre to claim that Democratic consolidation behind Obamacare is a vindication for Rahm Emanuel , of all people .The story as everyone reported it was that after the Massachusetts election , Emanuel wanted Obama to go small , basically give up on comprehensive health reform  and that Emanuel lost out when Obama decided to go big instead . Now the fact that going big looks likely to get through Congress  not in the bag yet , of course  and that if it does , it will almost surely be good for the Democrats , confirms that  Emanuel was right ?Actually , does anyone remember the 2006 midterms ? As I recall it , Emanuel wanted Dems to stay quiet about Iraq , and run on the economy  but was overruled . And then when Dems pulled out a historic victory , he claimed credit .I kind of like this approach . When Obama switches to harsh fiscal austerity , and the Fed sharply raises rates  and despite everything Ive been saying , the economy prospers  Im going to call it a vindication of my economic wisdom ."
1	"Im sure someone else has pointed this out , but theres a fundamental contradiction at the heart of the rights anti-Obamacare strategy  I mean , aside from the fact that it isnt going to work , and may do immense damage both to America and to the Republican brand .On one side , as Jonathan Cohn points out , inside the right-wing bubble its taken as gospel that Obamacare will be an utter , obvious disaster:If you sincerely believe Obamacare will bankrupt the country , violate personal liberty , raise costs or ruin insurance for most Americans , and generally destroy American health care , then its easy to believe that its only a matter of time before the rest of the country demands repealforcing both Senate Democrats and the president to go along . Its particularly easy to believe this if you live in the right-wing media bubble , where all of the reports about Obamacare focus on the laws shortcomings and failuresinsurance premiums going up , people losing coverage , part-time workers losing hours , and so on .But if the right really believed this , it should be happy to let Obamacare come into existence , then collapse . The last thing Republicans should want is to let Democrats snatch victory from the jaws of defeat by provoking confrontations over the budget and the debt ceiling before the American people get to experience the nightmare of expanded insurance coverage .In fact , politically the right is acting as if it fears that Obamacare will , in reality , be highly popular  that once the exchanges and the Medicare Medicaid expansion go into effect , people will decide that they like the new system , and strongly oppose efforts to reverse course . ( This is almost surely the more realistic view . ) So the law must be stopped at any cost before it goes into effect , and people learn first-hand that the anti-Obamacare propaganda was false .So which is it ? Are Republicans sure that disaster looms , or are they terrified because they suspect that things will be OK ? My guess is , both : clear thinking is not exactly a hallmark of the modern GOP , and may indeed be a positive disqualification for career success .Unfortunately , fear of Obamacare success is in the driving seat right now , and may well lead to government shutdown , debt default , or both ."
1	"JONESBORO , Ark .  Former President Bill Clinton , plunging right into his home states tight elections , implored Arkansans on Monday to support the Democratic ticket and defy predictions that turnout will plummet without a presidential race on the ballot .You dont have the luxury of staying home , so I am pleading with you : Vote ,  Mr. Clinton told college students at an outdoor rally here at Arkansas State Universitys campus .It was his first appearance of the fall campaign in the state that propelled him to the White House , and Mr. Clinton was notably spirited as he lashed out at out-of-state conservative groups that have hammered Senator Mark Pryor , the only Democrat remaining in the states congressional delegation and perhaps the most endangered Senate incumbent in the country this year .Mr. Clinton  joined by Mr. Pryor ; Gov . Mike Beebe ; and former Representative Mike Ross , the Democratic nominee hoping to succeed Mr. Beebe  addressed selfie-snapping students at two state universities and seemed to relish being back on the Arkansas campaign trail . He spoke in blunt terms at the first rally of the day at the University of Central Arkansas in Conway about how Republicans are trying to make the election about President Obama , who is deeply unpopular here .Republicans , he said , want you to make this a protest vote ,  alluding to the Senate and governors races as well as a competitive House contest in Central Arkansas .All three of these races , theyre saying , Hey , you might like these guys but , hey , you know what you got to do , you got to vote against the president . After all , its your last shot ,   Mr. Clinton said . Its a pretty good scam isnt it ? Give me a six-year job for a two-year protest . Thats Mark Pryors opponents message.If this was a veiled help-is-on-the-way message , it was the only implicit reference to the 2016 presidential election . Mr. Clinton made no mention of his wife and her plans , whatever they may be .The former president has deep personal connections to many of the candidates on the Democratic ticket this year and has regularly offered them advice about their campaigns . But Arkansas has become a far different place politically in the 40 years since Mr. Clinton first ran for office here .Arkansas resisted the Republican tide far longer than most any other Southern state , but has finally given way to the regions partisan realignment . Republicans now control both chambers of the Legislature , and if Mr. Pryor loses , the party will hold all six seats in the congressional delegation .Officials in both parties said Mr. Obamas unpopularity explained why this last bulwark of Southern Democratic strength fell . And Mr. Clinton made no effort to deny that theory on Monday .Theyre really running against the president , arent they ?  he said in Conway . Speaking as much as a strategist as a surrogate , he continued : Yeah , the economy is coming back . But nobody believes it yet because you dont feel it.Returning to the preferred Democratic message this year , he echoed the presidents speech last week in Illinois , noting that the country had created more jobs under the Obama administration than Europe and Japan combined .Without mentioning their names , Mr. Clinton criticized some of the Republicans running here on such issues as education aid and agriculture . But he also went further than Mr. Pryor had in talking about the new health law , heaping praise on Mr. Beebe for embracing the Affordable Care Act and noting how many Arkansans received health coverage in part because the state expanded Medicaid .Mr. Pryors opponent , Representative Tom Cotton , has avoided criticizing Mr. Clinton and used the former presidents return to the state to release a list of Democrats for Cotton.Were not bothered by President Clintons support of Senator Pryor ,  said David Ray , a spokesman for Mr. Cotton . What bothers us , and should bother all Arkansans , is Senator Pryors lock-step support of President Obamas agenda , which he has supported 93 percent of the time , including on Obamacare , the failed stimulus bill , the Wall Street bailout , judicial nominees , you name it.Mr. Clintons visit to the two campuses was the first leg of a two-day tour . He and the Democrats will make two more stops Tuesday in Northwest Arkansas , including at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville . Democrats here are dedicated to pushing voter turnout beyond what is typical in nonpresidential years and want to use the former presidents visit to engage college students . At both stops Monday , campaign staff members with clipboards signed up students after the rallies .Weve registered almost 100,000 new voters ,  Mr. Ross said .Democrats have also been helped by outside spending , but Mr. Clinton made no mention of that as he mocked third-party Republican groups for trying to portray Mr. Pryor as a liberal .

Mitch McConnells comments last weekend were instructive  Republicans in Congress have no meaningful plan to replace Obamacare and think that 30 million uninsured Americans is not the issue.Conservative health wonks will object to my characterization . They will say they have many plans to use markets to drive down costs so that affordability is less of an issue . They may even advance plans that spend money to subsidize some sort of coverage for some expanded group of Americans . But Republicans have not taken them up on those plans when they have had the chance .As readers of my Sunday column know , I think Chait and Barro are basically right about the Republican Partys approach to health care reform in the age of Obama . But under those circumstances , what would they have conservative health wonks and pundits do ? Its leaders preference for non-action and evasion notwithstanding , the G.O.P . remains the most plausible institutional vehicle for conservative ideas about health care , and Republican politicians are ( for the most part ) the only political figures capable of delivering the kind of reforms that right-of-center wonks and commentators want .

1	"Jonathan Cohn has a useful , comprehensive summary of what we now know about premiums under Obamacare , and does a very good job of keeping his temper in the face of the obscurantists . As I read it , however , I found myself hankering for a simple way to characterize whats going on . So Id like to throw out a stylized diagram , which looks like this:Remember the three-legged stool : the same policies available to everyone , regardless of preexisting conditions , the mandate , so that almost everyone ( we hope ) joins the risk pool , and subsidies to make insurance affordable to those with lower incomes . Who loses under this system  that is , who is better off with the present non-system ? Well , if youre very healthy you might be able to get a cheap policy now , or feel reasonably secure going without insurance . Under Obamacare , someone blessed with good health might find his ( or , more rarely , her ) premiums going up , and if hes wealthy as well as healthy he might not get much if anything in the way of subsidies ( and if hes very wealthy hell face new taxes ) . So weve know all along that there were going to be at least some people in the northeast corner of my box , doing worse under the new system . The question has always been , how many ?Its not an easy question to answer , even now  but all the evidence coming in suggests that my dotted line is further up and to the right than previously believed , implying fewer losers and more winners from Obamacare .How have the rights health pundits responded ? Not with contrary evidence , but by telling us things we already knew , and pretending that they are startling and destructive revelations . Some of it simply amounts to saying that there are indeed some people in the northeast corner of my box . Not everyone wins from the policy ! Well , duh .But at least thats a valid comparison . The other main argument is that if you look at average premiums under Obamacare , they will be higher than the premiums currently paid by young , healthy people in states without community rating . Again , well duh : insurers are now going to be covering people with health problems who werent covered before , so it would be a miracle if the premiums they charged were the same . It is , as Ezra Klein has said , a comparison of apples with oranges you might not even have been allowed to buy .The thing is , supporters of Obamacare could have been negatively surprised by the premium results . Some people were clearly going to win , but if the bids had come in high both the number of losers and the cost of the subsidies would be looking uncomfortably high . As it turns out , however , the news is looking pretty good ."
1	"Joni Ernst , the Iowa state senator and Iraq War veteran , was standing in a barn in a purple flannel shirt and an unzipped vest . Beside her , various swine burrowed in the hog lot ; two small pigs spooned ; there was copious squealing . When Ernst , who grew up on a farm castrating hogs , opened her mouth to speak , she drew the inevitable connection between her upbringing and her current role as a Republican candidate for the United States Senate . When I get to Washington , Ill know how to cut pork ,  Ernst said , smiling . Title cards reinforced her credentials . ( Joni Ernst : Mother . Soldier . Conservative. ) Im Joni Ernst , and I approve this message because Washington is full of big spenders . Lets make em squeal.The 30-second spot , titled Squeal ,  was part of a trilogy of ads for the candidate released earlier this year . In another , Ernst , enrobed in a biker jacket , rides a Harley-Davidson to a gun range . ( Joni Ernst : Set Sights on Obamacare ) . In a third , titled Biscuits ,  the camera focuses on a mans hands as they add butter to flour and use molds to cut circles . When I was working fast food , I learned the key to a great biscuit is lots of fat ,  Ernst tells the camera . Problem is , Washington thinks the same thing about our budget.Ernst is not the only candidate to have brought such a Capra-esque advertising strategy to this years midterm elections . Something Else Strategies , the media-consulting firm responsible for Squeal ,  also masterminded a widely noted spot for the Republican Mike McFadden , who is challenging Al Franken for his Senate seat in Minnesota . McFadden , a former college-football player who now coaches a youth team , recruited his players to appear in a Bad News Bears '' -style spot in which they mess up handoffs ( Washington is fumbling our future ) and clobber each other ( Obamacare needs to be sacked ) before the coach rouses them to get out there and hit somebody. At that point , for no particular reason , one player hits him below the belt , leaving the coach to recite the Im Mike McFadden , and I approve this message bit in a high-pitched squeal  the universal signifier of a guy who has just been hit in his junk .Critics of the McFadden ad questioned whether such a joke might fall beneath the dignity of a prospective United States senator . A McFadden spokesman earnestly responded that the hit , in fact , landed in the gut and that the candidates falsetto resulted from having the wind knocked out of him . ( To be fair , no one browbeat Bob Quast , an Independent Senate candidate in Iowa , after his ad warned potential home intruders that he would use my Glock to blow your balls off. ) But the critics were missing a crucial point . McFadden , a former investment banker with a law degree from Georgetown , was debasing not only his opponent but also , quite explicitly , himself . Hes in good company . Somebody once said if you want a friend in Washington , get a dog ,  John Barrow , the deep-drawling , flannel-shirted Democratic congressman from Georgia , recently told the camera as he threw a tennis ball to a golden retriever . Well , I wouldnt wish Washington on a dog. Left unsaid , of course , is why the Harvard Law graduate is running for the punishment of spending his sixth term in the capital . Barrow is great at filming campaign ads ,  says David Wasserman , who tracks House races for The Cook Political Report . He is especially great at bumpkinizing.As we have often been reminded , this was supposed to be a very important election cycle . The Republicans hopes of retaking the Senate could easily hinge on squeaker races like Ernsts in Iowa . This , along with the possibility of padding their majority in the House , would be a significant development for the nation , just as the issues loom huge , complex and ISIS-Ebola scary . And yet countless candidates seem determined to tout their fitness for these enormous challenges by trying to out-bumpkin one another . This spring , Ernsts opponent , Bruce Braley , a four-term congressman , assured voters that he grew up doing farm jobs and working a grain elevator.There is , of course , a delicate art to bumpkinizing . Republicans , in particular , have been burned in recent Senate elections by nominating candidates  Christine ODonnell , for instance , or Todd Akin  who turned out to be too bumpkin for their own good and imploded in winnable races . This time around , the strategy has been tweaked : If you want to come off as an amateur , its helpful to be a pro of some sort . One of the years more unlikely populist heroes , after all , is a cowboy poet from South Dakota named Larry Pressler . This Washington outsider , who is running for Senate as an Independent , also happens to be a former Republican senator and a lobbyist who has considered running for mayor of Washington .Skilled politicians have a proud tradition of conveying utter contempt for their profession , especially when theyre running to keep their jobs . This is , to some degree , rooted in our history . As they drafted the Constitution , the founding fathers envisioned that their new republic would be governed by a temporary leadership class of farmers , doctors and assorted commoners who would retain close ties to their communities . Self-styled feisty populists , like Andrew Jackson , tended to denigrate the well-bred qualities of their opponents . Andrew Jackson , who can fight was how the decorated general sold himself in the 1828 presidential campaign , compared with John Quincy Adams , who can write. Jackson , who in fact was a wealthy and experienced politician , won easily .The historian Garry Wills has referred to this entrenched American tendency as the glorification of the amateur and contempt for the professional. This dynamic was heightened during the 1960s , and even more so after Watergate , when an increasingly antiestablishment electorate gravitated toward candidates who could prove that they had no link to the professional order . The 75 new Democrats who were elected to Congress in 1974  the so-called Watergate babies  swept in largely on a promise to overturn traditional politics . The Republican House overthrow of 1994 , in response to Bill Clintons shaky first couple of years , was grounded in fashioning a class of 73 anti-Washington Washingtonians . Led by Newt Gingrich , nearly all of them were committed to term limits and to spending as little time in Washington as possible . ( For the record , many of them are still there . )The apotheosis of the modern bumpkin mode has been embodied by Sarah Palin , who nearly found herself one 72-year-old heartbeat from our highest national office . Palin , the starkest example yet of a proud unsophisticate taking the national stage , has remained visible and unapologetic . She also appears to have made little attempt to fill the knowledge gaps she demonstrated in 2008 or to shed her association with reality-TV-style family dramas , like the recent drunken brawl she apparently observed at an Anchorage birthday party . According to Alan Schroeder , a professor of journalism at Northeastern University and an expert on the celebrity aspects of politics , Palin has come to represent a new standard of the slim rsum.Palin may have had a rare talent , if somewhat limited appeal , but the outsider streak of this years midterms comes in response to a unique and distinctly awful political landscape . Not only is President Obamas popularity in free fall , but whatever Everyman credibility he mustered during his Washington Outsider candidacy in 2008 has long since been dissipated through the regal isolation of his office and the suspicion that he is aloof and presumably ill equipped at castrating hogs . He is , in other words , politically toxic . Braley was willing to abide a visit on his behalf from Michelle Obama , but he undoubtedly benefited from the fact that the first lady repeatedly mispronounced his name as Bailey.Candidates themselves dont deserve all the blame for their bumpkinizing . Much of that rests with the blizzards of money being blown from wealthy donors and super PACs to a growing oligarchy of media consultants , who typically live on the coasts and work for multiple candidates at once . In a D.C. twist , those bumpkins we see on our screens are often not even real bumpkins so much as some rich guys idea of what a bumpkin should be . One telltale signal is how familiar the props are  the livestock , the guns , the motorcycles , the dogs and , of course , the flannel . An ad for Rob Maness , a Louisiana Republican running for the Senate , features a trifecta : a gun , an airboat and an alligator .In large part , this is what we have to show for the nearly $ 4 billion that is expected to be spent in this campaign , the most of any midterm election in history . When you have this much outside spending , way too much of the advertising has no soul ,  acknowledged Todd Harris , a partner at Something Else Strategies , who is based in Washington , far from his clients Ernst and McFadden . The people who are creating these spots , in other words , dont have much connection to the state theyre working in . Its a good bet that few at Something Else Strategies have spent much time on hog farms . They are paid either way .I was thinking about the 2014 midterms as I rewatched Mr . Smith Goes to Washington ,  the classic Frank Capra movie that celebrated its 75th anniversary last month . In a sense , Jefferson Smith , the plucked-from-nowhere senator played by Jimmy Stewart , came to represent the ideal of the pure-hearted Washington bumpkin . Mr. Smith is a nave outsider with quirky habits ( he trains pigeons ! ) and a determination to live up to the ideals embodied by the monuments he so admired . His capacity for umbrage at the corrupt ways of his colleagues and the press made him an admirable foil . Likewise , he willingly engaged in a filibuster for 24 hours  just like the highflying outsiders of recent cycles , Ted Cruz and Rand Paul .But Smiths antics are actually geared toward pending legislation . He does not care about getting attention , let alone harbor any ambition of running for president . In real life , Cruz and Paul have no background in legislating or have shown no interest in it , in part because it might taint them as Washington professionals in places like Iowa .Meantime , as Election Day loomed , Joni Ernst returned to her roots . In late October , as she held onto a narrow margin , her campaign released a new ad featuring the candidate in another flannel shirt and vest , surrounded by still more snorting pigs . Dirty , noisy , and it stinks ,  Ernst complains . Not this lot  Im talking about the one in Washington. Her campaign issued a statement assuring everyone that the ad featured the same hogs that appeared in Squeal ,  although theyre older and bigger now. It was also produced by the same media consultants , who are also older now and , presumably , richer too ."
1	"Just hours before the government was set to shut down , President Obama called House Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio , according to a spokesman for Mr. Boehner . But it did not appear they resolved much of anything .The president called the speaker this evening to discuss funding for the government and Obamacare ,  said Brendan Buck , a Boehner spokesman . The speaker told the president that Obamacare is costing jobs and that American families are being denied basic fairness when big businesses are getting exemptions that they are not.The call lasted nearly 10 minutes ."

( Reuters ) - An outgoing Tennessee lawmaker representing a Knoxville district admitted on Friday to sending a ridiculing message on social media to a newly laid-off political reporter .State Senator Stacey Campfield , a Republican , confirmed that he sent a public Facebook message on Thursday that said , so , Do YOU have any comments now ?  to Cari Wade Gervin , a former government reporter for Knoxvilles Metro Pulse .Gervin , along with the entire staff of the 23-year-old alternative weekly newspaper , was laid off this week by the Knoxville News Sentinel , owned by E.W .

Hes just doing it because he wants attention before he leaves office ,  said a tearful Gervin , 37 , who has worked at the paper for four years .Campfield , who recently lost a contentious primary race for his seat in Knoxville , served as a lightning rod for controversy during his roughly 10 years of public service as both a representative and a senator in the Tennessee legislature .Campfield said on Friday that Gervin had lied about him in the past .Do I care about someone who lost their job lying about me ?

1	"LAS VEGAS  President Barack Obama defended his decision to bypass Congress and overhaul U.S. immigration policy on his own on Friday , saying he was forced to act because House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner would not let legislation come to a vote .With many Americans skeptical of his decision to bypass Congress and impose an immigration overhaul unilaterally , Obama attempted to rally support for his move in a speech at a Las Vegas high school , saying illegal immigrants need a chance to come out of the shadows .He engaged in a cross-country debate with Boehner , the top U.S. Republican , who accused Obama in Washington of sabotaging chances for bipartisan legislation and vowed to lead a fight to block his executive actions .In the summer of 2013 , the Democratic-run Senate passed compromise immigration legislation but the bill died in the Republican-controlled House . Obama said he waited to see if the House would ever pass the legislation , but Boehner would not let it come to a vote .`` I told John Boehner , 'I 'll wash your car , walk your dog , whatever you need to do , just call the bill , '' Obama said . `` And he did n't do it . ''To those lawmakers who feel he overstepped his constitutional authority , Obama said his message to them is : `` Pass the bill . ''Obama 's move threatens to herald a new round of partisan gridlock in Washington as Republicans who will control both chambers of Congress in January react with scorn to his decision .Republicans remain split on the best course of resistance to Obama 's action easing the threat of deportation for some 4.7 million undocumented immigrants . Conservative groups were already pulling together legal strategies to challenge it .`` With this action , the president has chosen to deliberately sabotage any chance of enacting bipartisan reforms that he claims to seek . And as I told the president yesterday , he 's damaging the presidency itself , '' Boehner told reporters .`` We 're working with our members and looking at the options available to us , '' he said . `` But I will say to you , the House will , in fact , act . ''Obama received a rousing welcome from a largely Latino audience at Del Sol High School in Las Vegas , the same place he visited just after beginning his second term in 2013 , when he laid out his principles for immigration reform .`` Si se puede , '' they chanted .A heckler shouted at Obama that his order did not go far enough . Obama engaged him from across the high school gym .`` I 've heard you , young man , Ive heard you . But what Im saying is that this is just a first step , '' Obama told him .Outside , a couple of dozen protesters who opposed his actions shouted slogans and held up signs that said : `` Stop Obama Amnesty . ''Before getting off Air Force One shortly after landing in Las Vegas , Obama signed two presidential memoranda to set in motion part of the biggest U.S. immigration changes in a decade .Just hours after his speech on Thursday night , Republicans launched a long-threatened lawsuit against the administration on another topic , accusing it of abusing executive authority through implementation of the president 's `` Obamacare '' health reform law .Republicans have said in recent weeks they would consider adding a challenge to the Obama immigration order to the healthcare lawsuit .But the most prominent strategy under consideration , supported by many conservatives in Congress , is to withhold funds for implementation of the immigration order from a major spending bill needed to fund the government by Dec. 11 .A fight over the spending bill could lead to another shutdown of federal agencies , one year after a 16-day closure that inflicted heavy political damage on Republicans .`` We do need to find a way to really push back , '' Republican Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama , who has called for using the spending bill as a vehicle to challenge the order , said at the Heritage Foundation .Other Republicans have suggested a range of options , from opposing all of Obama 's nominees unless he relents , to stand-alone legislation undoing the order and even impeachment .( Additional reporting by Emily Stephenson , David Lawder and Amanda Becker in Washington ; Editing by John Whitesides and Tom Brown )"
1	"LAST month , for the 37th time , the House of Representatives voted to repeal Obamacare , with many Republicans saying that its call for greater government involvement in the health care system spells doom . Yet most other industrial countries have health care systems with far more government involvement than we are ever likely to see under Obamacare . What does their experience tell us about Republican fears ?While in Sweden this month as a visiting scholar , Ive asked several Swedish health economists to share their thoughts about that question . They have spent their lives under a system in which most health care providers work directly for the government . Like economists in most other countries , they tend to be skeptical of large bureaucracies . So if extensive government involvement in health care is indeed a recipe for doom , they should have clear evidence of that by now .Yet none of them voiced the kinds of complaints about recalcitrant bureaucrats and runaway health costs that invariably surface in similar conversations with American colleagues . Little wonder . The Swedish system performs superbly , and my Swedish colleagues cited evidence of that fact with obvious pride .The United States spends more than $ 8,000 a person per year on health care , well more than twice what Sweden spends . Yet health outcomes are far better in Sweden along virtually every dimension . Its infant mortality rate , for example , was recently less than half that of the United States . And males aged 15 to 60 are almost twice as likely to die in any given year in the United States than in Sweden .In fairness , those differences result partly from lifestyle . In Sweden , workers are more likely to commute by bicycle than by car , for example , and obesity is far less common . Absolute poverty and income inequality  both associated with adverse health outcomes  are also lower .But when illness strikes , the Swedish health care system responds efficiently . Managers have exploited economies of scale by consolidating services into fewer but larger hospitals . The American system has also gone through consolidation , but , by contrast , boutique hospitals are also more common here  partly in response to demands from patients with very high-cost health plans . In large hospitals , CT scanners and other expensive diagnostic and treatment machines are in nearly constant use , versus only a few hours of weekly use in some small ones .Larger hospitals with heavier patient flows also enable their staff to hone their skills through specialization and experience . If you are getting a knee replacement or coronary bypass surgery , you want teams that do scores of such procedures each month .Doctors in the two countries also face different financial incentives . In the United States , under the fee-for-service model , they can bolster their incomes , often substantially , by prescribing additional tests and procedures . Most Swedish doctors , as salaried employees , have no comparable incentive .Another important difference is that , unlike many American health insurance providers , the government groups that manage Swedish health care are nonprofit entities . Because their charge is to provide quality care for all citizens , they dont face the same incentive to withhold care that for-profit organizations do . That more hip-replacement operations are performed per capita in Sweden than in most other countries is almost certainly a reflection of the generous care options rather than of any inherent deficiency in Swedes hip joints .The Swedes also provide drugs and other treatments only when evidence establishes their effectiveness . People can spend privately on unproven treatments , but the government refuses to impose their cost on taxpayers .IS there a catch ? When I asked my Swedish hosts to describe any downsides to their system , several mentioned the waiting times for certain nonemergency services . One told me that whereas in the United States a wealthy or well-insured patient might schedule a hip replacement with only a weeks notice , in Sweden the wait could be as long as three months . He described such waits as a design feature , noting that they allowed facilities to be used at consistently high capacity , and thus more efficiently .Obamacare also contains many evidence-based provisions for medication and other treatments . But at least in its initial stages , it will not be able to match the cost savings achieved in Sweden .Thats because the legislations design was heavily constrained from the outset . Surveys showed that most Americans were satisfied with the existing health plans provided by their employers , so any new system that required people to abandon them would have been a political non-starter . As I discussed in an earlier column , however , such plans are an extremely inefficient way to pay for health care . They arose as an unfortunate historical accident during World War II , when employers used them to sidestep the wage controls that had resulted in extreme labor shortages .Employer health plans have been disappearing steadily , and may one day be gone entirely . The encouraging news is that the Affordable Care Act was intended to foster the evolution of a new system that can capture many of the gains currently enjoyed by countries like Sweden .For that to happen , however , Congressional critics must abandon their futile efforts to repeal Obamacare and focus instead on improving it . Their core premise  that greater government involvement in health care provision spells disaster  lacks support in the wealth of evidence from around the world that bears on it .The truth appears closer to the reverse : Because of pervasive market failures in private health care markets , this may be the sector that benefits most from collective action ."

1	"LEXINGTON , Ky.  In a debate at close quarters , Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes vowed Monday night to be independent of President Barack Obama if she wins Kentucky 's close and costly Senate race , but Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said his rival hopes to deceive voters about her intentions .Despite her pledge , Grimes stuck to her days-long refusal to say if she voted for Obama in 2008 and 2012 . She insisted that if she answered the question , it would `` compromise a constitutional right '' to cast a secret ballot .McConnell quickly scoffed at that . `` There 's no sacred right to not announce how you voted , '' he said , seated next to Grimes for an hour-long debate hosted by KET , the state 's public television station . `` I voted for Mitt Romney proudly . I voted for John McCain , '' he added , referring to the two men Obama defeated .The race is one of several that will determine if Republicans capture a Senate majority in midterm elections . They need to pick up six seats to prevail , and a GOP triumph would all-but-certainly make McConnell the new majority leader , with the power to set the Senate 's legislative agenda during the last two years of Obama 's presidency .The contest is also one of the most expensive in the country , with millions of dollars in television commercials aired by the candidates , their parties and allies focused on Senate races nationally . McConnell also has benefited from about $ 20 million in advertisements from a pair of organizations set up by former aides and associates solely to re-elect him to a sixth term .McConnell and Grimes disagreed sharply about the minimum wage , coal , trade and the health care law . McConnell , who has led the charge in the Senate to repeal the law known as Obamacare , said it 's all right with him if Kentucky wants to continue an expansion of care for low-income residents set up as part of the program .Side by side with McConnell for the only time in their race , Grimes offered several possible labels for the 30-year Senate veteran  `` Senator no-show , Senator gridlock and Senator shutdown . ''McConnell countered that as Senate Republican leader , he has been involved in the major bipartisan deals that have been reached in the past four years of divided government .He also said that despite her attempts to establish political independence from the president , Grimes was a delegate to Democratic National Conventions in 2008 and 2012 , when some Democratic office-holders stayed away . `` She 's made a major effort to deceive the people of Kentucky , '' he said .But Grimes said she has disagreements with Obama , adding , `` the president is not on the ballot this year . It 's myself and Sen . McConnell . ''Grimes said repeatedly the minimum wage should be raised , and said if it were , at least a million Americans would be better off . McConnell countered that a study by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office said it would cause the loss of between 500,000 and one million jobs .McConnell also sharply rebuked Grimes when she said he has become wealthy while in the Senate `` on the backs of hard-working Kentuckians . '' The five-term senator said an independent fact-checker had debunked her claim , and said the bulk of his increase in wealth over three decades came from an inheritance by his wife , former Labor Secretary Elaine Chao , and from her employment .The president is highly unpopular in Kentucky , and Grimes has spent months and millions in advertising money trying to establish her political independence from him .McConnell , whose own poll ratings are poor after 30 years in office , has worked nonstop to cast his rival as a certain ally of the administration .Both candidates unveiled new television ads in the hours before the debate .Grimes ' commercial featured retired Democratic Sen. Wendell Ford , who said McConnell `` is Mr. No , '' and said that unlike the incumbent , the challenger wo n't vote to send jobs overseas .McConnell 's ad showed Chuck Todd , an NBC newsman who moderates Meet The Press , saying earlier in the week , `` I think she ( Grimes ) disqualified herself '' by not saying who she voted for .Grimes , 35 , was recruited by the Democratic party nationally to run , and got off to a fast start while McConnell , 72 , was bogged down in a costly primary race with tea party rival Matt Bevin .Grimes and McConnell both won their primaries with ease in mid-May , at a time the Democratic challenger was ahead in most if not all of the public polls . She soon came under a withering barrage of televised attacks , though . In recent weeks , her favorability has eroded in public surveys , many of which show McConnell with a slender advantage in a very tight race .The debate 's sponsors did not allow still photographers or reporters into the studio during the event , preventing them from capturing the full context of how the candidates performed outside the view of KET 's cameras ."
1	"LISTENING to the debate about President Obamas health care plan , some critics argue that Obamacare is going to need Obamacare  because its going to be a train wreck. Obama officials insist theyre wrong . Well just have to wait and see whether the Affordable Care Act , as the health care law is officially known , surprises us on the downside . But there is one area where the law already appears to be surprising on the upside . And that is the number of health care information start-ups its spurring . This is a big deal .The combination of Obamacare regulations , incentives in the recovery act for doctors and hospitals to shift to electronic records and the releasing of mountains of data held by the Department of Health and Human Services is creating a new marketplace and platform for innovation  a health care Silicon Valley  that has the potential to create better outcomes at lower costs by changing how health data are stored , shared and mined . Its a new industry .Obamacare is based on the notion that a main reason we pay so much more than any other industrial nation for health care , without better results , is because the incentive structure in our system is wrong . Doctors and hospitals are paid primarily for procedures and tests , not health outcomes . The goal of the health care law is to flip this fee-for-services system ( which some insurance companies are emulating ) to one where the government pays doctors and hospitals to keep Medicare patients healthy and the services they do render are reimbursed more for their value than volume .To do this , though , doctors and hospitals need instant access to data about patients  diagnoses , medications , test results , procedures and potential gaps in care that need to be addressed . As long as this information was stuffed into manila folders in doctors offices and hospitals , and not turned into electronic records , it was difficult to execute these kinds of analyses . That is changing . According to the Obama administration , thanks to incentives in the recovery act there has been nearly a tripling since 2008 of electronic records installed by office-based physicians , and a quadrupling by hospitals .The Health and Human Services Department connected me with some start-ups and doctors whove benefited from all this , including Dr. Jen Brull , a family medicine specialist in Plainville , Kan. , who said that she was certain she had been alerting her relevant patients to have colorectal cancer screening  until she looked at the data in her new electronic health care system and discovered that only 43 percent of those who should be getting the screening had done so . She improved it to 90 percent by installing alerts in her electronic health records , and this led to the early detection of cancer in three patients  and early surgery that saved these patients lives and also substantial health care expense .Todd Park , the White Houses chief technology officer , said many new apps being developed have been further fueled by the decision by Health and Human Services to make available massive amounts data that it had gathered over the years but had largely not been accessible in computer readable forms that could be used to improve health care.It started in March 2010 when Health and Human Services met with 45 rather skeptical entrepreneurs ,  said Park , and rather meekly put an initial pile of H.H.S . data in front of them  aggregate data on hospital quality , nursing home patient satisfaction and regional health care system performance . We asked the entrepreneurs what , if anything , they might be able to do with this data , if we made it supereasy to find , download and use. They were told that in 90 days the department would hold a Health Datapalooza ,   a public event to showcase innovators who harnessed the power of this data to improve health and care .Ninety days later , entrepreneurs showed up and demonstrated more than 20 new or upgraded apps they had built that leveraged open data to do everything from helping patients find the best health care providers to enabling health care leaders to better understand patterns of health care system performance across communities , said Park . In 2012 , another Health Datapalooza was held , and this time , he added , 1,600 entrepreneurs and innovators packed into rooms at the Washington Convention Center , hearing presentations from about 100 companies who were selected from a field of over 230 companies who had applied to present. Most had been started in the last 24 months .Among the start-ups I met with are Eviti , which uses technology to help cancer patients get the right combination of drugs or radiation from Day 1 , which can lower costs and improve outcomes ; Teladoc , which takes unused slices of doctors time and makes use of it by connecting them with remote patients , reducing visits to emergency wards ; Humedica , which helps health care providers analyze their electronic patient records , tracking what was done to a patient , and did they actually get better ; and Lumeris , which does health care analytics that uses real-time data about every aspect of a patients care , to improve medical decision-making , collaboration and cost-saving .Obamacare will be a success only if it can deliver improved health care for more people at affordable prices .

Mark Pryor reached into his own medical history Tuesday to explain his vote on the nation 's new health care law , telling Arkansans his battle with a rare cancer 18 years ago influenced him .The two-term Democrat , who is in a tough re-election battle , fought a clear-cell sarcoma discovered after a pickup basketball game . He had five weeks of chemotherapy and a 13-hour surgery that his campaign called experimental .`` It makes the argument that much clearer when Sen. Pryor tells his personal story of his battle with his cancer , where he could have easily lost his life , '' Pryor campaign spokesman Erik Dorey said .Pryor , then 33 , was having surgery to repair what was believed to be a basketball injury when doctors found the cancer , which has a high mortality rate .In a 30-second advertisement , Pryor says the experience helped him back a law that prevents insurers from canceling policies if someone gets sick or denying coverage for pre-existing conditions . He does not mention the Affordable Care Act by name .`` No one should be fighting an insurance company while you 're fighting for your life , '' Pryor says in the ad , which is running statewide as part of a six-figure buy .The campaign of his Republican challenger , Rep. Tom Cotton , said it was thankful that Pryor survived his cancer scare and admired his courage .`` We all agree that nobody should be denied coverage due to a pre-existing condition , '' Cotton spokesman David Ray wrote in an email .He said `` Obamacare '' harms the middle class and small businesses and has caused millions to lose existing insurance coverage after being told they could keep it .`` Further , Sen. Pryor has supported a taxpayer-funded bailout of big insurance companies that lose money as a result of 'Obamacare , ' '' Ray wrote . `` We need to start over with reform that makes health care more affordable and keeps health care decisions between patients and doctors . ''The National Institutes of Health , citing small 1992 and 1999 studies , put the five-year survival rate for clear-cell sarcoma at 54 percent . It said the cancer is found primarily in the extremities of young adults ."
1	"LITTLE ROCK , Arkansas  As voters head into primaries on Tuesday in the southern swing state of Arkansas , one of the most fiercely debated issues among Republican candidates is the centerpiece healthcare policy of President Barack Obama , a Democrat .A group of Arkansas Republicans are battling for their political lives in primary showdowns with challengers from their own party who are trying to excoriate them for reaching a compromise with Democrats on a state health plan . This plan , aimed at the poor , is called the `` Private Option '' and meant to be an alternate to the Affordable Care Act , or `` Obamacare '' .`` It 's the hot button , '' said Republican state Senator David Sanders of Little Rock .At stake is how far the Republican party will swing to the right in a state where they hold a narrow majority in the House of Representatives . Even Democrats often position themselves as conservative centrists .Republican challengers in state legislative races are targeting incumbent GOP lawmakers who supported their party 's leadership and approved the Private Option .The issue has created far fewer ripples in Democratic races .The Tuesday primary is for Democrats and Republicans with voters casting ballots for candidates to represent the parties for local posts , the statehouse and U.S. Congress in elections in November .The program being hotly debated uses federal Medicaid funds from the Affordable Care Act to help buy health insurance for low-income Arkansas residents , many of whom would otherwise be assigned to Medicaid or have treatment costs absorbed by doctors and other healthcare providers .`` That 's all they 're making it about , the Private Option , '' Sanders said of the Republican challengers .Variations on the Arkansas model have since been adopted or are under consideration in other states including Republican strongholds such as Utah , and battleground states in presidential elections including Pennsylvania , Michigan and Ohio .Opponents in the Arkansas General Assembly said both the Private Option and the Affordable Care Act are too costly and represent an unacceptable expansion of government .The future of the Private Option could also be determined on Tuesday . The Arkansas Senate approved funding for the program this year by a single vote , and three Republican senators who supported it are facing primary opponents .Obamacare will be hanging over one of the state 's marquis races in the general election in November where incumbent U.S . Senator Mark Pryor , a Democrat , has been straining to maintain a lead in the polls over the Republican challenger , U.S. Rep. Tom Cotton , who is supported by the Tea Party .Pryor and Cotton face no serious threats in the primaries .Pryor , who is seeking a third six-year term , voted for the Affordable Care Act . Cotton is a harsh critic of the program .Health care reform also could be a decisive issue in races for two open U.S. House seats in Arkansas now held by Republicans - Cotton , and U.S. Rep. Tim Griffin , who is leaving Congress after two terms .( Reporting by Steve Barnes ; Writing by Jon Herskovitz ; Editing by Scott Malone and Diane Craft )"

Governor Mike Beebe , a Democrat who helped craft the plan with Republican lawmakers who control the statehouse , said failure to pass the funding could blow a hole in the budget .`` The very Republican anti-Washington healthcare contingent , when all this came out , that did n't want a state exchange now has come to the conclusion that they want to reverse their position and do a state exchange , '' Beebe told a news conference in Washington on Monday .He warned that failure to pass the funding could lead to a loss of $ 89 million in projected savings coming from the Private Option , prompting drastic cuts in services .House Speaker Davy Carter , a Republican and a Private Option supporter , has expressed confidence that funding will eventually be secured . The House will probably vote on the bill on Tuesday , and every day after that until it passes , he said .Beebe has warned that failure to continue the Private Option would make his proposed $ 5 billion state budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1 untenable , because savings the program anticipates would compensate for tax cuts Republicans demanded .Last week , the 100-member House fell just a few votes short of the 75 votes needed to continue funding .The program uses federal Medicaid funds from the Affordable Care Act , or Obamacare , to help buy health insurance for low-income Arkansans , many of whom would otherwise be assigned to Medicaid or have treatment costs absorbed by doctors and other healthcare providers .The plan appeals to some conservative lawmakers who want to provide healthcare for the uninsured through the private sector rather than the federal Medicaid program .

1	"LONDON  A sobering statistic emerged on Thursday as the United States Supreme Court prepared to deliver its judgment on Obamacare .It confirmed that the U.S. spends more per capita on publicly funded health care than almost every other country in the developed world . And that includes countries that provide free health care to all their citizens .Figures published on Thursday by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development , a 34-nation grouping of advanced economies , showed that less than half of health spending in the U.S. was publicly financed compared with an O.E.C.D . average of 72.2 percent .However , the overall level of health spending in the United States is so high that public ( i.e . government ) spending on health per capita is still greater than in all other O.E.C.D . countries , except Norway and the Netherlands ,  according to the Paris-based organizations Health Data 2012 report .Combined public and private spending on health care in the U.S. came to $ 8,233 per person in 2010 , more than twice as much as relatively rich European countries such as France , Sweden and Britain that provide universal health care .Are Americans healthier as a result ? The U.S. has fewer doctors per capita than comparable countries , and fewer hospital beds . But more is spent on advanced diagnostic equipment and health tests .Life expectancy has risen in line with that in other developed countries , but the average American life span of 78.7 years in 2010 was below the O.E.C.D . average . Obesity in the U.S. was the highest in the 34-nation survey .Obesitys growing prevalence foreshadows increases in the occurrence of health problems ( such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases ) , and higher health care costs in the future ,  the O.E.C.D . said .An earlier survey found that U.S. health care was overpriced and not always better than in comparable countries . Sometimes treatments are provided which are unnecessary , or even undesirable ,  the organization said in a 2011 report on comparative health indicators .It does a lot of elective surgery ,  the survey said of the U.S. health care system , the sort of activities where it is not always clear-cut about whether a particular intervention is necessary or not.Advocates of state-funded universal health care might use such statistics to show free health care for all is not only fairer but also cheaper .In defense of a Canadian health care system maligned during the Obamacare debate as an inefficient socialistic enterprise ,  Tim Shufelt of Canadas Financial Post wrote : Canadians pay much less per capita on health care than do Americans , while ranking higher among the most common measures of human health.Canadas embrace of universal health care reflects sentiment in most countries where free treatment is regarded as a right .In Europethe right of access to health care for all is considered normal ,  Pierre-Yves Dugua wrote in a Figaro blog , as is a financing system based on compulsory contributions.The economic arguments in favor of European-style systems have been evident in the domestic U.S. debate on Obamacare .Commenting on the latest O.E.C.D . figures , an editorial in Gannetts The Advertiser noted : America pays big-time money for health care and gets Third World results.The greatest public good comes from universal access to care that emphasizes prevention and health education ,  according to article . The European systems , often socialized or with health insurers forced to offer basic plans to everyone , can do that . Ours doesnt."

1	"LOUISVILLE , Ky.  Two groups with close ties to Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell are on track to spend nearly $ 20 million on television advertisements to sway Kentucky voters , a staggering amount for a single race that stands as a textbook example of the use of outside money in a tight contest .While the effort began more than a year ago , the majority of the advertising by the Kentucky Opportunity Coalition and Kentuckians for Strong Leadership has aired since McConnell and Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes won primaries in mid-May .Much of it is relentlessly negative toward the Democratic challenger and President Barack Obama , who is highly unpopular in the state . `` Liberals coast to coast are rolling out the red carpet for Alison Grimes . She 's backed by Obama 's biggest fundraisers , '' said one early ad .`` Obamacare , the war on coal , big spending , higher taxes . That 's Obama 's agenda . And Alison Grimes supports Obama , '' said another .Charly Norton , a spokeswoman for Grimes , said that the senator 's `` millionaire and billionaire cronies have targeted this race more than any other in the country . '' She added McConnell has called in the `` DC special interest cavalry to help bail him out , but it 's not working as our campaign remains ... positioned to win on November 4th . ''Federal law prohibits any coordination between the McConnell campaign and the two groups , one a SuperPAC and the other a nonprofit , often referred to as a `` c4 '' for the section of law that governs its operations . At the same time , the groups ' efforts intensified this spring , when the senator took something of an advertising breather after he won his primary over tea party challenger Matt Bevin .One or the other outside organization was on the air almost nonstop from May until Labor Day , an advertising campaign that coincided with a run of polls that indicate erosion in Grimes ' support at a time McConnell is plagued with chronically weak favorability ratings of his own .Democrats strongly dispute the public surveys , and say the race remains exceedingly tight . The party 's senatorial campaign committee is on the verge of an intensive round of television advertising to boost Grimes as the race enters its final five weeks .The groups backing McConnell also invested in radio and Internet ads and T-shirts in their drive to return the Kentucky Republican to the Senate for a sixth term , often emphasizing the same issues that the senator mentions in his own advertising .`` We have owned rural radio ... and coal country since the ( campaign 's ) beginning , '' said Scott Jennings , a spokesman for the two groups . He referred to advertising alleging that Grimes would back policies detrimental to an industry reeling from the loss of thousands of jobs .SuperPACs first came to prominence in the 2012 presidential campaign , and Center for Responsive Politics lists more than 70 in existence this year to help individual candidates . It 's not known how many campaigns are backed by the same combination that supports McConnell .Fred Wertheimer , president of Democracy 21  a nonprofit , nonpartisan group that analyzes the influence of money in politics  said the roles played by both SuperPACs and political nonprofits permit donors to circumvent the $ 5,200-per-person cap that federal law sets for contributions to individual candidates .`` When you have a SuperPAC and a c4 focused on one candidate , the only purpose of the c4 is to allow donors to give secret money to the candidate , '' he said . `` The money is n't secret from the donors or the candidates , it 's only secret from the American people . ''Kentuckians for Strong Leadership , a SuperPAC , may take unlimited donations and must disclose its donors . It may advocate directly for a candidate 's victory or defeat . Kentucky Opportunity Coalition does not have to disclose its donors , and is limited in its advocacy .Other groups take a similar two-track approach in the increasingly important world of independent political spending . Associates of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid aid Democratic candidates through Senate Majority PAC and Patriot Majority .Republican strategist Karl Rove backs a pair of groups , American Crossroads and Crossroads GPS , operating under the same general guidelines .Unlike the organizations supporting McConnell , the groups aligned with Reid and Rove are national , airing advertising in numerous states with key Senate races .The Kentucky groups have a single-state focus , although they rely heavily on Crossroads ' political consultants and have received donations from some of Crossroads ' contributors . Stephen Law , president of both Crossroads organizations , is on the three-member board of KSL . Law is also former chief of staff for McConnell and served under former Labor Secretary Elaine Chao , the senator 's wife .On its website , KOC says it `` seeks to be a positive voice for those who seek to make our commonwealth a better place . ''To that end , it ran a television commercial in August that said Grimes ' attacks on McConnell had been `` exposed as blatantly dishonest , phony , a throwback to Obama 's lies . '' It added that Grimes is `` bankrolled by Obama elites who oppose our way of life , '' and concluded , `` Alison Grimes : Beholden to Obama . Lying to us . ''"

Shareholders financial diagnosis is damning , too . They took some $ 700 million off the value of LabCorp as cost cuts fell far short of the 32 percent premium paid .Theres little revenue overlap between the two  LabCorp estimated the figure at less than 3 percent of its businesses . That means antitrust wont be a concern , but it also limits the scope for reducing expenses . The companies figure there are $ 100 million of estimated savings . These are worth perhaps $ 700 million to shareholders today , once taxed , capitalized and discounted for the three years itll take to realize them . That covers just half the $ 1.4 billion sweetener LabCorp is paying for control .Executives are hoping that greater revenue will make up the shortfall . Considering where health care appears to be going , that general premise holds some water . Doctors are increasingly being paid based on how patients fare , rather than the number of people treated . LabCorp already has a taste of this model under the Affordable Care Act . Obamacare has increased the number of patients with insurance , but is squeezing prices paid per test .The idea is that owning Covance will allow LabCorp to inject more into its top line by combining and then acting on the data generated by labs and clinical trials . One example would be to offer patients who test positive for a rare disease the chance to participate in a trial for a potential treatment . Another would use practical lab work and theoretical results from clinical trials to determine which LabCorp patients are most likely to have a heart attack .Its an appealing vision , but combining two completely different businesses is hard . Doing so while simultaneously shifting focus to new services , some of which dont exist yet , is even tougher . New start-ups , meanwhile , like ultra-rapid and cheap testing firm Theranos , are threatening to upend the testing business . Until LabCorp can show theres merit to its vision of health care , investors are right to regard the deal as an overpriced foible .Robert Cyran is a columnist for Reuters Breakingviews .

1	"Last summer , lawmakers churned out news releases using the term Obamacare , 530 of them in June , July and August .This summer ? 138 .A year ago , the individual mandate for what is officially known as the Affordable Care Act had yet to go into effect . Federal and state exchange websites had yet to go live , and congressional appropriators were still writing government spending legislation with an eye toward defunding the law ( leading to the partial government shutdown later that year ) .In a typical expression of sentiment from last summer , John Culberson , a Texas Republican , published an email to constituents entitled My Day Is Not Complete Unless I Vote to Cut Spending and Repeal Obamacare.This summer , not only are there fewer Obamacare-related news releases , but the tone is also different . Constituents are more likely to read statements on judicial decisions on the law , news about bills intended to trim around the laws edges , or descriptions of lawmakers requests for information from the Department of Health and Human Services .Although the occasional statements praising the law have been issued by some congressional Democrats , most in that party still appear to shy away from the topic . The database of congressional news releases maintained by The Upshot contains just two positive statements mentioning Obamacare in the title last summer , from Jos E. Serrano of New York and Carol Shea-Porter of New Hampshire , both Democrats .Congressional opponents of Obamacare havent given up , of course . But the relative dearth of Obamacare-titled statements this August shows that they have found other issues to raise with constituents as the midterm elections approach , like investigations into the Internal Revenue Service and Department of Veterans Affairs .Congressional news releases mentioning veterans in the title have jumped more than 105 percent this summer compared with 2013 ."

1	"Last week , I took issue with the claim , advanced by Jonathan Chait and Josh Barro , that the idea of a legitimate conservative alternative to Obamacare is a fantasy rather than a difficult-to-achieve but nonetheless plausible goal . Here are a few pieces laying out some material relevant to this conversation : One from Ramesh Ponnuru in 2010 , discussing the various things Republicans did do on health care ( for good and ill ) during the decade they controlled Congress ; one from Avik Roy , analyzing the insurance-expanding health care reform that George W. Bush proposed ( to swift and certain opposition from Democrats ) in 2007 ; and one from Yuval Levin , in which he discusses the McCain campaigns 2008 proposal and Paul Ryans 2009 alternative to the Democratic health care bill . Taken together , they suggest that the Republican Party is at least institutionally capable of advancing reforms that improve access to health insurance : Such reforms may not have been advanced on Capitol Hill of late , but they arent the policy equivalent of unicorns .Now its true that most of these Republican reforms , real and hypothetical , would not have insured many people ( at least initially ) as Obamacare . Its also true that in the last few years , the G.O.P . has been moving away from even a rhetorical commitment to the goal of perfectly universal coverage . But on both counts I think that the conservative approach is defensible . Given the unsustainability of our existing commitments , the central role that spiraling costs play in making insurance inaccessible , and the difficulties inherent in trying to make Washington responsible for insuring every inhabitant of what will be a nation of 400 million people by centurys end , a reform that expanded insurance substantially but not completely in the short term while putting the health care system as a whole on a sounder footing in the long run ( as Bushs 2007 proposal might have done ) could be preferable , on moral as well as practical grounds , to a reform that achieves universality in the near term but ultimately brings everybody on board a sinking ship . ( Although universal but non-comprehensive is also a plausible way of thinking about what the conservative goal for health care coverage ought to be . )The big problem facing conservative health care reformers , then , is not the G.O.P.s unwillingness to embrace universality , and despite what many liberals believe neither is it necessarily libertarian dogma or Norquistian intransigence . Its a more basic problem of coalition politics : Any substantial health care reform , market-oriented as well as dirigiste , is inevitably disruptive , and ( as Reihan Salam points out ) the Republican coalition includes more voters who are satisfied with existing arrangements than does the Democratic coalition . As we saw in 2009-2010 , to pass a comprehensive health care bill you need not only policy commitments from elected officials but immense internal pressure from the partys activist groups and rank-and-file . The Republican coalition just isnt as likely to generate that kind of pressure on its elected officials , and indeed certain segments of that coalition are likely to find reason to resist even the most impeccably free-market reform . Straightforward risk aversion , not ideology , is the crucial factor discouraging Republican politicians from taking the lead on the issue .But this is precisely why the current political moment presents a unique opportunity to conservatives . The fact that the Democrats did pull out all the stops in 2009-2010 , courting a giant backlash in the process , means theres a unusually large amount of political cover for a right-of-center alternative . ( Repeal-and-replace is an easier lift than a stand-alone overhaul would be , because the Republican constituencies who might stand to lose from a more market-friendly reform fear Obamacare much , much more . ) At the same time , through their support for the Ryan budget , the Congressional G.O.P . has pre-committed to entitlement reform votes that make a vote for a right-of-center health care alternative look relatively noncontroversial by comparison . Whether Obamacare is repealed or left intact , its hard to imagine a better atmosphere for figuring out , and then forging ahead with , what Republicans actually want to do instead .But of course to date the G.O.P . has done precious little with this opportunity , preferring to play the political angles instead . And here my views do overlap with Chait and Barro : If the Republicans win the White House and the Senate and then somehow manage to repeal Obamacare without putting any significant reforms in its place , it will represent not only policy malpractice , but a moral scandal as well ."
1	"Last week , National Reviews editors quoted my praise for Utahs soon-to-be ex-senator , Bob Bennett , in the course of arguing that conservatives shouldnt feel any regret over his Tea Party-abetted defeat . Since the case against Bennett emphasized his support for the bipartisan Wyden-Bennett health care bill , NRs editorial focuses on that legislations drawbacks:Bennetts bill was not superior to Obamacare . It was worse than it in some respects , but in the crucial respects it was simply identical . Obamacares three main elements are regulations that block insurance companies from accurately pricing risk , a requirement that all people buy this irrationally priced product , and subsidies to help some of them do that . Bennetts legislation featured all three elements . His legislation would have resulted in lower health spending than Obamacare , and more people would have purchased insurance for themselves rather than through their employers . But the lower spending would largely have been generated by pushing people into HMOs rather than by freeing them to make their own cost-quality trade-offs . And the solution to a decades-long federal policy of encouraging employer provision of health insurance is not a sudden move to a federal policy of prohibiting it .Wyden-Bennett was not my preferred health care reform either , but was it really no better than Obamacare from a conservative perspective ? It scored as deficit neutral with many fewer spending cuts and tax increases than the legislation we actually got . It did away with Medicaid and S-CHIP entirely . And it severed the link between employment and insurance with one swift stroke . Yes , its mix of mandates and regulations mirrored some of the major features of Obamacare , but one could level a similar critique about the provisions of the alternative health care legislation that Paul Ryan and Tom Coburn co-sponsored , and I trust that NR would not welcome a primary challenge against either of those legislators .The editorial goes on to argue that Wyden-Bennett would have been at least as unpopular as Obamacare proved if it had ever emerged as a viable alternative , and so the notion that it could have been a vehicle for heading off Obamacare is a fantasy. This may be true , but remember that many of the more conservative alternatives to Obamacare would have presumably been more unpopular still . ( The Wyden-Bennett bill was almost certainly a more politically-plausible reform than John McCains 2008 health care plan , for instance , which was basically Wyden-Bennett with fewer mandates and regulations and a less progressive system of tax subsidies . ) And given that the Democrats ended up winning the health care battle outright , Im not sure Id be as quick as NRs editors to dismiss one of the substantial efforts to forge a less-bad compromise .A successful political party can live without lawmakers who are obsessed with compromise for compromises sake , trimmers who constantly shift leftward and rightward depending on the political winds , and politicians who by rights belong in the opposition party . ( Hence my lack of sympathy for Charlie Crist , Arlen Specter , and Dede Scozzafava . ) But it needs to accommodate intelligent deviations and disagreements , and well-intentioned efforts at bipartisanship from politicians who line up with their party 80 or 90 percent of the time . National Reviews editors recognized this principle two years ago when they endorsed Mitt Romney for President of the United States , his support for an Obama-style health care bill in Massachusetts notwithstanding . ( He knows that not every feature of the health-care plan he enacted in Massachusetts should be replicated nationally ,  they wrote at the time , but he can also speak with more authority than any of the other Republican candidates about this pressing issue. ) Given that Wyden-Bennett was superior to Romneycare in several important ways , I wish that they had extended the same charity to Bob Bennett ."
1	"Leading up to the crisis in Washington , the right-wing of the right-wing party stressed that blocking the continuing resolution was essential because it represented the last , best chance to stop the Affordable Care Act . Last , best chance was actually a mantra of sorts . This is our last chance and our last best chance to do something about this ,  said Senator Marco Rubio , Republican of Florida , on the Senate floor in late July .  [ T ] his may be the last best chance to defund Obamacare before it goes into effect ,  the political group FreedomWorks argued over the summer .Now that the shutdown has come and gone , some Republicans recognize that the defund-or-shutdown tactic was doomed to fail . I think we have fully now acquainted our new members with what a losing strategy that is ,  Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said on Thursday .But many are vowing to keep fighting health care reform . On Wednesday , Mr. Rubio predicted that there would be an all-out revolt in this country over the Affordable Care Act . And when that happens that is , I think , the moment to absolutely act and say we are going to get rid of this law and then look for opportunities in the future to replace it.The next day , Senator Ted Cruz said I would do anything , and I will continue to do anything , to stop the train wreck that is Obamacare.Matt Kibbe , the president of FreedomWorks , told The Washington Post that he plans to hold rallies with young people who oppose the individual mandate .And in a Thursday op-ed for The Wall Street Journal , Jim DeMint , president of the Heritage Foundation , claimed there was no good reason for him to back down . Sure , the president won re-election , but ObamaCare was not the central fight in 2012. Sure , full repeal is probably impossible while a Democrats in office , but delaying implementation by withholding funds is a reasonable and necessary fight. By keeping the national focus on health care , moreover , Republicans can avoid negotiating other issues . If the Republicans had not fought on Obamacare , the compromise would have been over the budget sequester.Last and best , it turns out , can mean one of many ."
1	"Lets imagine that Republicans swept the 2012 elections and were now in control not merely of the House but of the presidency and the Senate , too .Now lets take it one step further and say that by using the filibuster the Democratic minority in the Senate had successfully blocked President Romneys appointments to federal district and appellate court judgeships .What if , faced with this Democratic intransigence , the conservative Federalist Society helped devise a strategy to revamp Senate rules to eliminate the filibuster so that judicial nominees could be confirmed by a simple majority instead of the 60 votes required to overcome a filibuster ?The elimination of the filibuster has allowed President Romney to appoint three judges to the critically important United States Court of Appeals , District of Columbia Circuit , establishing a decisive 7 to 4 conservative majority on that bench . Whats more , two of the the three judges newly appointed by President Romney are members of the Federalist Society and the new conservative majority on the D.C . Circuit is now positioned to rule Obamacare unconstitutional .The Koch brothers  recall we are still in an alt-hypothetical universe  reward the Federalist Society by directing 100 loyal billionaires to contribute to the group .Would these developments provoke liberal outrage ?They certainly would .But its not only the right that uses secretive organizations to keep rich donors anonymous while it seeks to influence elections and policy . Liberals do the same , and the press in large part gives them a pass .As you no doubt realized while you were reading , the hypothetical described above did not take place , but something approximating it did . Instead of Republican offenders , the players were President Obama , a Democratic Senate , the progressive American Constitution Society , and the Democracy Alliance , a network of very wealthy liberal donors .Heres what the Democratic Party and its allies actually did . The American Constitution Society  the left counterpart to the Federalist Society  helped lay the intellectual groundwork for Senate Democrats to put an end to filibusters of judicial nominees .The elimination of judicial filibusters in November 2013 allowed Democrats to approve , by simple majority , three of Obamas appointees to the United States Court of Appeals , D.C . Circuit , giving liberals a 7-4 majority .Because of the administrative law and national security cases it hears , the D.C . Circuit is considered the second most important court in the nation .The significance of the confirmation of three new Democratic appointees to the court became apparent in July , when a three-judge panel of the court ruled 2-1 in Halbig v. Burwell that residents of the 36 states that use the federal health care exchange were ineligible for subsidized insurance under Obamacare . The panels decision appeared to be a potentially crippling blow to the Affordable Care Act . The two judges in the majority on the panel were appointed by Republican presidents , the dissenter by a Democrat .On Sept. 4 , however , the full Circuit Court of Appeals decided to set aside the three-judge panel decision and rehear the case en banc  that is , with all 11 judges , a majority of whom are now Democratic appointees .Has there been an outcry about Democratic court packing ? Only in a right-wing online publication , the Washington Free Beacon , Democracy Alliance Bankrolled Court-Packing Scheme ,  and on the conservative website Breitbart.com , Exclusive - Leftist Money , Harry Reid Trying to Hijack Sanctity of the Independent Federal Judiciary. But the story does not end there . Conservatives claim that the Democracy Alliance is at the core of a liberal conspiracy .Mark Holden , general counsel at Koch Industries , contends that the Democracy Alliance orchestrates the activities of a permanent left infrastructure with ties to 172 organizations , each determined to attack the Koch brothers agenda of free enterprise and democratic capitalism .In a speech he gave to a closed meeting of conservative donors in Dana Point , Calif. , on June 16 , The Opposition : Understanding Their Strategy and Infrastructure ,  Holden , speaking about liberal organizations , argued thatThe Koch organization network is well known for its secretiveness . Holden suggested that their [ Democracy Alliance ] bottom line is not that different than ours , but in some ways theyre much better at it.A tape and transcript of Holdens speech were released by the left-leaning website Lady Libertine which , by its own account , seeks to unite the disenfranchised and resurrect the American Dream. Holden confirmed its veracity in an email to The Huffington Post .Despite Holdens argument that the liberal and conservative dark money networks are equivalent , there are substantial differences between them .The Democracy Alliance is an organization of roughly 100 very rich men and women who agree to contribute at least $ 200,000 annually to a list of roughly 20 liberal think tanks and advocacy groups , according to documents obtained by Politico . The Alliance itself makes no contributions . Nor does it pay for television ads or engage in other direct campaign activity .In effect , the Alliance helps guide an estimated $ 30 million a year . It does not disclose its members or the groups that are recipients of its members contributions , although a substantial amount of information has been gleaned by enterprising reporters .The projected total budgets of the endorsed organizations for 2014 , according to the documents , are $ 189.2 million , of which the $ 30 million from Democracy Alliance partners would amount to nearly 15 percent .The Alliance does not claim tax-exempt status .In contrast , the Koch network is overwhelmingly made up of tax-exempt organizations claiming either 501 ( c ) 4 or 501 ( c ) 6 exempt status . Many of the Koch organizations spend money on political ads . The Center for Responsive Politics and the Washington Post estimated that in the 2011-12 election cycle , the Koch network of political , tax-exempt nonprofits raised at least $ 400 million .Gara LaMarche , the president of Democracy Alliance , defended his members , who have been accused of hypocrisy . The charge , coming from both the left and right , LaMarche wrote , centers on the assertion that progressive wealthy donors are spending a lot of money in elections when they also claim to be for getting money out of elections.LaMarche countered in an email thatIn contrast , political spending by the Kochs and their alliesDavid Brock , the chairman of Media Matters , which is one of the groups endorsed by the Alliance , made a similar argument at a Democracy Alliance meeting in Santa Fe in June:Brock and LaMarches argument is politically risky . Claiming the moral high ground to assert that you can do something that your morally crippled adversaries can not is one of the more effective strategies to alienate people .Liberals are not alone in the gravity of their claims . Officials of Koch Industries contend there have been death threats against the Kochs and threats against our facilities. They like to cite a 1958 Supreme Court decision , N.A.A.C.P . v. Alabama , in which the court unanimously backed the N.A.A.C.P.s refusal to turn over its membership list to the Alabama Attorney General on the basis that release of the names would put the lives of N.A.A.C.P . members in danger .The leadership of the Democracy Alliance is now queasy about its policies on anonymous donations . The Koch organizations remain adamant in their refusal to disclose donors .In a series of emails and phone conversations , LaMarche said that he is pressing members of the Alliance to be more open . He would like , for example , to list the names of those willing to give up their privacy . He also said that he expects the Alliance to adopt a policy of releasing the names of the organizations to which it recommends its members make contributions .The more transparent we can be , the better . Progressive values are much more in line with transparency ,  LaMarche said during our conversation .Koch officials declined to answer my question , Is transparency a good thing in democratic politics ? Political spending by dark money groups that do not disclose donors is on track to break all previous records . By some calculations , such spending accounts for more than half the media outlay by outside organizations in current House and Senate races .Robert Maguire , who set up the Politically Active Nonprofits Project at the Center for Responsive Politics , reported on Sept. 4 that dark money organizations have already dropped $ 68 million on air time alone in Senate and House races , making up 56 percent of all the spending by independent expenditure groups .Publications like Mother Jones are warning that the 2014 elections will be the start of a Dark-Money Apocalypse. If recent Supreme Court rulings stand and the Federal Election Commission continue to refuse to regulate political groups that do not disclose contributors , dark money spending will at some point in the not-too-distant future become the single most important source of election cash in the key battleground contests that determine which party controls the House and Senate . This is already the case for some Republican candidates in tight contests .In the North Carolina Senate race , for example , Thom Tillis , the Republican challenger , has so far spent $ 3.23 million . Conservative dark money groups have invested twice that , $ 6.7 million , in his candidacy . Kay Hagen , the incumbent Democrat , has raised $ 7.96 million , and liberal dark money groups have spent $ 2.1 million .The Center for Responsive Politics has demonstrated that in the top eight 2014 Senate races , dark money tilts decisively to the right : $ 28 million spent by conservative groups , $ 12.3 million by liberal organizations .In the long run , the relatively modest ( but growing ) dependence of Democrats on dark money , mega-dollar contributors to super PACs and other funding mechanisms is corrupting , even as it comes alongside the partys parallel success in building a powerful small donor base . On issues of taxes , regulation , spending and campaign finance , the Republican Party has established itself as the advocate of the wealthiest Americans . Insofar as the Democratic Party moves in the same direction , it will be unable to act as a counterbalance to the right .While neither the left nor the right has clean hands , liberals have far more to lose , and much less to gain , from continued hypocrisy ."
1	"Like other big employers , in the mid-1990s Harvard University was struggling with the ballooning cost of providing health insurance .It chose what was a novel solution for the time . It dropped its standard deal  a subsidy that rose in line with the price of the insurance policy  and switched some 10,000 workers on its payroll to a fixed subsidy that encouraged them to shop around for care .For Harvards accountants , the change worked wonders . A study a couple of years later by David M. Cutler , a Harvard economist , and Sarah Reber , a Harvard graduate , concluded that competition among insurers cut the universitys health bill by 5 to 8 percent .But not everybody was equally pleased . Families of workers who chose the Preferred Provider Organization offered by Blue Cross/Blue Shield  the most comprehensive plan , with lots of doctors and hospitals on its network  faced a $ 500-a-year jump in their out-of-pocket spending on health care .Younger and healthier workers canceled their P.P.O . plans , enrolling in cheaper H.M.O . options or dropping Harvard insurance altogether . Left with a sicker patient base , the P.P.O . raised its premiums further , which prompted the next layer of relatively healthy customers to leave .And so on . In 1997 , Blue Cross/Blue Shield withdrew its P.P.O . from the market , making it a victim of what economists call the death spiral of adverse selection .In a couple of months the nation is set to experience a similar shock on a very large scale : the greatest change in how Americans pay for health care since the advent of Medicare nearly half a century ago .Come October , millions of uninsured people will be able to choose one of several health plans , offered at four different tiers of service and cost through new health exchanges coming onstream in every state .Cheap bronze plans will shoulder some 60 percent of patients medical expenses . Pricey platinum plans will cover at least 90 percent . But insurers will not be allowed to exclude people with pre-existing conditions , or charge more for the sick , or put a lifetime cap on medical costs . Their policies will have to cover a minimum standard of medical care . And the government will subsidize those who can not afford to buy the policies .President Obama and his advisers hope the overhaul will do two things . The first is to extend coverage to tens of millions of Americans who today lack health insurance . The second is to hold the line on rising health care costs .Over time , success will depend on what happens to the cost curve ,  Professor Cutler told me . If we dont bend the cost curve , everything will fail . The government wont be able to afford it . Nobody will be able to afford it.In theory , the overhaul could meet both goals . Millions of new Americans armed with a subsidy and shopping among plans would bring consumer choice to bear , finally , on the health care industry . Insurers would compete to create policies that offered the most value for money , pressuring hospitals and doctors on behalf of all of us .Yet despite the care the administration took in establishing incentives and safeguards , even some of Obamacares most committed backers are wondering whether the experiment will work as advertised  or , like Harvards P.P.O. , go off the rails along the way .Adverse selection is perhaps the direst threat . For Obamacare to work , millions of healthy , young , uninsured Americans must join a health plan to counterbalance the sicker millions who are most likely to buy insurance . Otherwise , health plans on the exchanges will have to raise premiums to shoulder the higher costs .Selection will also take other forms . Healthier Americans will probably flock to cheaper bronze plans . And insurers will vie to enroll the healthy . In some states , big insurers have chosen not to participate in exchanges to avoid their strictures . On the outside , they could still sell cheap plans to skim off the healthy and avoid a rule that insurers on the exchanges must also offer more generous silver and gold plans .Adverse selection is not the only risk .A few studies have found that more competition among health insurers leads to lower hospital fees on average and that premiums rise when insurer competition diminishes . But researchers have also found that top hospitals  which any decent plan must have on its network  increase their fees when more health plans compete for their business ."
1	"Lots of people have been referencing this Democracy Corps report on focus-group meetings with Republicans , and with good reason : Greenberg has basically provided a unified theory of the craziness that has enveloped American politics in the last few years .What the report makes clear is that the current Republican obsession with attacking programs that benefit Americans in need , ranging from food stamps to Obamacare , isnt about some philosophical commitment to small government , still less worries about incentive effects and implicit marginal tax rates . Its about anxiety over a changing America  the multiracial , multicultural society were becoming  and anger that Democrats are taking Their Money and giving it to Those People . In other words , its still race after all these years .One irony here is that at this point its the liberals who believe in America , while the conservatives dont . I believe in our ability to change while retaining our essential nature ; I believe that todays immigrants will be incorporated into the fabric of our society , just as Italian and Jewish immigrants  once regarded as fundamentally incompatible with American ways  became white by the middle of the 20th century .Another irony is that the great right-wing fear  that social insurance programs will in effect buy minority votes for Democrats , leading to further change  is becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy . The GOP could have tried to reach out to immigrants , moderate its stances on Obamacare , and stake out a position as the restrained , sensible party . Instead , its alienating all the people it needs to win over , and quite possibly setting the stage for the very liberal dominance it fears .Meanwhile , a key takeaway for us wonks is that none of the ostensible debates were having  say , the debate over rising disability rolls  can be taken at face value . Yes , we need to crunch the numbers , but in the end the other side doesnt care about the evidence ."
1	"Lots of people having fun with this great report from Jason Cherkis at the Kentucky State Fair:A middle-aged man in a red golf shirt shuffles up to a small folding table with gold trim , in a booth adorned with a flotilla of helium balloons , where government workers at the Kentucky State Fair are hawking the virtues of Kynect , the states health benefit exchange established by Obamacare .The man is impressed . This beats Obamacare I hope ,  he mutters to one of the workers .This goes along with all the polling evidence , which says that people like the actual provisions of the Affordable Care Act , but have no idea that those provisions are in fact the substance of that terrible , tyrannical Obamacare program they keep hearing about . And because the insurance exchanges that are at the heart of the program will be run at the state level , with many different names , well have quite a few people happily signing up for Obamacare while denouncing the program and believing it has nothing to offer them .And I say that its all good .Its true that Democrats running in 2014 will have the extra problem that even people who are getting big benefits from the new program may not understand who to thank . On the other hand , the first and most crucial thing is to get the program up and running , with as many eligible people as possible  especially the relatively young and healthy  signing up . And Republican efforts to dissuade people from joining Obamacare will be blunted to the extent that Americans have no idea that Kynect , or Your Health Idaho , or whatever is in fact the local incarnation of the dread program .Given all the disinformation out there , the strategy of think globally , name locally is actually a great idea . Eventually people will probably figure out that it is in fact a federal program  although maybe not , since a fair number of people apparently dont know that about Medicare . But by the time they do , theyll have experienced the things reality , and realized that guaranteed , subsidized insurance is not , in fact , slavery ."
1	"MANCHESTER , N.H.  Republicans eyeing the 2016 White House race battered President Barack Obama 's health care law and nicked each other Saturday , auditioning before a high-profile gathering of conservatives that some political veterans said marked the campaign 's unofficial start .A speaking program packed with potential presidential candidates weighed in on the House Republicans ' controversial budget , the party 's struggle with Hispanics , the GOP 's future and the upcoming midterm elections while taking turns on a conference room stage facing hundreds of conservative activists gathered in New Hampshire 's largest city .But the Republican Party 's near-universal opposition to the president 's health care law dominated the conversation just days after Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius resigned after leading the rocky rollout of the program derided as `` Obamacare . ''Texas Sen. Ted Cruz declared that one resignation is not enough . `` We are going to repeal every single word of Obamacare , '' said the first-term senator and tea party favorite .Another tea party favorite , Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul , insisted that the GOP must broaden its appeal in order to grow . The Republican Party , he said , can not be a party of `` fat cats , rich people and Wall Street . ''Neither Paul nor Cruz defended the sweeping budget plan authored by another potential presidential contender , Rep. Paul Ryan , R-Wis . The budget , approved by the Republican-led House in recent days , transforms entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid to help reduce federal spending .Former Arkansas Gov . Mike Huckabee said the Ryan plan was simply `` a starting point , '' but that , `` there would be some things I 'd probably change , '' declining to be more specific .Another high-profile Republican , real estate mogul Donald Trump , was more critical .`` His whole stance is to knock the hell out of Medicare , Medicaid and Social Security , '' Trump said of Ryan . `` I would leave it alone . I do n't want to hurt people . ''The summit comes as prospective presidential candidates begin to step up appearances in key states ahead of the 2016 presidential contest , even though New Hampshire 's first-in-the-nation presidential primary is n't planned for another two years .`` It 's the unofficial kickoff of the 2016 process , '' said Republican operative Mike Biundo , who managed Rick Santorum 's last presidential campaign .As potential presidential candidates jockey for position , the stakes are high for the November 's midterm elections , where Republicans are fighting to claim the Senate majority . The president 's health care law could figure prominently in November House and Senate contests across the country .The industrialist Koch brothers-affiliated Americans for Prosperity , which co-hosted Saturday 's summit , has already spent millions of dollars on health care-related attack ads aimed at vulnerable Democratic senators in New Hampshire , North Carolina , Alaska , Colorado , Iowa and elsewhere .Sebelius resigned on Friday , days after the Obama administration announced that enrollment in the Affordable Care Act had grown to 7.5 million , a figure that exceeded expectations and gave Democrats a surprise success after a disastrous rollout . It was welcome news for Democrats who 've been forced to defend their support for the unpopular law .In a conference call , Rep. Chris Van Hollen , D-Md. , insisted that `` Democrats are not running away from the Affordable Care Act . ''Democratic National Committee spokesman Mike Czin noted that Republican opposition to the health care law was the foundation of the GOP 's unsuccessful political strategy in 2012 . He said that the debate has changed now that the law has been implemented and millions of people are enjoying its benefits .`` That 's a debate that we 're going to have , and we 're eager to have , '' Czin said .At the same time , Van Hollen , the senior Democrat on the House Budget Committee , called for Republicans to defend their support for a GOP budget plan introduced this week that would repeal the health care law , transform Medicare , reintroduce the `` doughnut hole '' for prescription drug costs and enact deep cuts in education .Trump , who says he 's also considering a Republican presidential bid , echoed many of the Democrats ' concerns . `` Leave my Medicare alone , '' he declared .Campaigning in Iowa the night before , Ryan defended his recently passed budget plan as a sign of growing GOP unity .`` Some people wanted to go further , some people thought it went too far . The point is we unified around these common principles in a plan , '' the Wisconsin congressman said after headlining an Iowa GOP dinner . `` That 's very important to me  which is we ca n't just oppose , we have to propose . ''Back in New Hampshire , conservatives also criticized another potential presidential contender who was not in attendance , former Florida Gov . Jeb Bush , who recently suggested that many immigrants enter the United States illegally because of love for their families .Trump described Bush 's suggestion as `` out there . ''"

1	"MANITOU SPRINGS , Colo.  It was warm and sunny and smelled of cinnamon-orange tea inside a roadside cafe here in the mountains , but as a dozen Democrats waited for Senator Mark Udalls campaign bus to arrive for a last-minute pep rally , the air was laced with dread .In the final polls before Election Day , Mr. Udall was trailing his Republican challenger , Representative Cory Gardner . Early voter returns tracking Colorados first major election run entirely through mail-in ballots showed that Republicans had turned in 104,000 more ballots than Democrats , though they were hoping to close the gap .Democrats had spent the campaign assailing Mr. Gardners positions on abortion and birth control , trying to paint him as a Cro-Magnon opponent of womens reproductive rights  was their strategy failing them ?Im really worried about Gardner and Udall ,  said Michael Merrifield , a Democrat running for a State Senate seat , who attended the Udall rally . Ive even had Democrats say to me , Im just tired of hearing about the womens issue. I live in a Democratic district ,  said Alma Cremonesi , a property manager in nearby Colorado Springs . Theyre not voting.Ms. Cremonesi said she had a thick stack of papers with the names and contact information of hundreds of likely Democratic voters  the fruits of sophisticated voter turnout operations that in recent years have helped push Democrats over the top here and in tight elections across the country . There are about 600 registered Democrats in her precinct , and Ms. Cremonesi said her job was to reach the 400 who had not yet mailed in their ballots . It was really overwhelming ,  she said .Years of Republican stumbles , combined with booming growth along the diverse and increasingly urban Front Range of the Rocky Mountains , have helped Democrats turn this states political roster as blue as the cloudless sky on this autumn morning . Democrats control both Senate seats and the governors mansion , and have majorities in both chambers of the state legislature . But this year , Republicans believe they can ride a wave of voter discontent  with new gun-control laws , health care reform and an uneven economic recovery  back into power .Lets claw back that lost territory ,  Bob Beauprez , the Republican hoping to unseat Gov . John W. Hickenlooper , said at a rally last week . Lets make Colorado a red state again.As the campaign closes , Democrats are still trying to convince voters that Mr. Gardner is more conservative than the earnest , grinning Republican who has lofted ahead in polls and won an endorsement from The Denver Post . Speaking to students on the campus of Colorado College , in Colorado Springs , Mr. Udall pointed out that Mr. Gardner opposes same-sex marriage , and said Mr. Gardners positions on climate change , renewable energy and college loans showed no vision for the future .As he does at many stops , Mr. Udall brought up his passion for mountain climbing to describe what has become a bitter , high-spending race . You dont schmooze your way up a mountain ,  he said . You dont climb it by accident . You dont trash-talk your way up a mountain . You just go climb it.The airwaves are a blizzard of Senate campaign ads  more than 55,000 have aired since January 2013 , according to the Wesleyan Media Project . High-powered proxies are flying in to rouse the faithful . Bill Clinton , Michelle Obama and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts have come out for Mr. Udall . Jeb Bush , the former governor of Florida , and Gov . Chris Christie of New Jersey are stumping for Republicans .Last week , dozens of Republican volunteers packed Mr. Gardners campaign offices in the college towns of Boulder and Fort Collins to get a handshake or selfie with the amped-up candidate . Spotting a boy in a Denver Broncos football jersey , Mr. Gardner whipped out his cellphone and showed him a photo of John Elway , the Broncos general manager and Hall of Fame quarterback , who has donated to Mr. Gardners campaign .The boys father , Dave Holdbrook , a truck driver who has been on disability for several years after a job-related injury , said he had already mailed in his ballot for Mr. Gardner .Im really concerned about whats going to happen with Obamacare ,  he said . Spendings just out of control , and Udalls lined up with Obama 100 percent of the way.Mr. Gardner , pivoting between reporters , voters and volunteers , offered a rapid-fire recitation of his case against the Democrats : Mr. Udall is a social-issues warrior who does not represent the entire states values . The economic recovery may have cut unemployment to 4.7 percent in Colorado , but it has left too many people behind , especially in cities like Pueblo and Colorado Springs . Government is choking off small businesses . Coloradans are working harder and harder and falling further behind . People in much of the state feel they have been forgotten . There should never be a forgotten Colorado ,  Mr. Gardner said .Outside his Boulder office , a group of students supporting immigration reform lined up to heckle Mr. Gardner about his opposition to granting citizenship to undocumented immigrants . Republican volunteers faced them down , shouting : Udall lies !  and Detect ! Detain ! Deport ! Mr. Gardner had long since left , but the two sides kept yelling at each other as the sun sank behind the mountains ."
1	"MIAMI  Most uninsured adult Americans lack basic knowledge about President Barack Obama 's signature healthcare law and have n't visited their online insurance marketplace because they think health insurance is unaffordable , according to a survey released on Thursday .The survey from Enroll America , a non-profit healthcare enrollment coalition , found that 68 percent of uninsured adults had not yet logged onto their online exchanges .A similar number , 69 percent of the uninsured , still lacked knowledge about tax subsidies and other financial help designed to make the Affordable Care Act , better known as Obamacare , affordable for many , the survey said .`` Large proportions of the uninsured are also still in the dark about deadlines and that brand new plans are available , '' Enroll America said in a report about the survey .`` A lack of facts about costs and coverage may be the greatest barriers to enrollment , '' it added .The law is expected to reduce the number of uninsured in the United States by almost half , or about 25 million people , in the next 10 years .As many as 7 million people are expected to buy insurance on the state exchanges and 8.7 million new beneficiaries are expected to enroll in Medicaid in 2014 alone .The administration , however , appears to be far behind in meeting its enrollment goals .Anne Filipic , the president of Enroll America , told reporters in a conference call about the survey that more than 2 million uninsured Americans have signed up for plans through state and federal exchanges so far .The nationwide survey of 910 adults was conducted December 12-22 by PerryUndem Research/Communication and had a margin of error of 4.3 percentage points .It found that eight in 10 uninsured adults were unaware of the need to sign up for insurance by March to avoid a fine , under the so-called individual mandate .Forty-three percent of Latinos participating in the survey said they were n't aware of the federally managed Healthcare.gov website . Only 25 percent of blacks and 21 percent of Latinos said they visited the website , compared with 30 percent of whites .In response to the survey , Enroll America said it was hiring 60 more staffers in 11 states to get its message out , sending them to supermarkets and churches to connect with more people while seeking volunteers to serve as `` ambassadors '' for Obamacare .`` Greater awareness and education about financial help and addressing cost concerns may be effective ways to boost enrollment for the remainder of the period , '' the coalition said( Additional reporting and writing by Tom Brown ; Editing by David Adams and Jan Paschal )"
1	"MIAMI  Over scrambled eggs and croquettes , Andres Malave gave a last-minute pep talk to about a dozen volunteers in a Cuban restaurant before they left to meet voters .`` Do n't just deliver a message , '' he said before beginning his own 3_-hour shift knocking on doors . `` Try to get them engaged . ''It 's a strategy playing out in New England diners , Midwest truck stops and West Coast cafes : conservative organizers train and send out thousands of volunteers holding an iPad and an interest in helping fellow activists shift America 's politics to the right .They are the backbone of Americans for Prosperity , the flagship organization of the political network backed by industrialist billionaires Charles and David Koch . While the group 's spending in Senate races has attracted national attention , it 's these less noticed field efforts that could have greater impact and help reshape the Republican Party heading into the 2016 presidential election .The organization has more than 500 paid workers in 35 states and has become one of the conservative movement 's best organized , most powerful outside groups . Building on the community-based approach President Barack Obama used successfully in 2008 and 2012 , it now has a political footprint unmatched among GOP-affiliated operations and is racking up legislative victories .The group scuttled efforts to raise taxes to build a downtown campus for the well-regarded zoo in Columbus , Ohio , and derailed plans in Florida 's Legislature to subsidize improvements to the Miami Dolphins ' football stadium . It helped fend off a recall effort against Gov . Scott Walker , R-Wis. , and pushed pro-business workplace laws in Michigan and Indiana .It did n't shy away from going after traditional allies , as was the case when Gov . Rick Scott , R-Fla. , briefly considered expanding Medicaid , a core component of Obama 's health care law . Americans for Prosperity mobilized supporters , the Republican-led Legislature quickly rejected the idea and Scott dropped his proposal .Tim Phillips , the group 's president , said Americans for Prosperity had helped usher in `` a once-in-a-generation renaissance for economic freedom policies , '' and was poised to keep financial issues prominent in 2016 .`` For the first time , we have the infrastructure on our side to sustain these policy battles , '' he said .This fall , Americans for Prosperity is campaigning against a sales tax increase in South Carolina 's Greenville County , as well as trying to elect conservatives to office . Unlike what it has done for most of this year , the group now is engaging in explicitly political messages for the campaign 's final weeks .Potential presidential contenders have taken notice .GOP Sens . Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of Texas spoke at the group 's annual summit in August . Sen. Marco Rubio , R-Fla. , headlined the Koch brothers ' seminar for major conservative donors this year .Americans for Prosperity sprung up in 2004 but has gained heft during the past two election cycles . Its budget has grown from less than $ 3 million in 2004 to more than $ 130 million for the 2012 election cycle .In many places , the group has more trained and paid operatives than the traditional political parties have . Nowhere is this more obvious than Florida , where the group has 10 offices , its single largest field operation .In the group 's Orlando outpost , Phillips recently met with 15 volunteers who were wearing bright green T-shirts with Americans for Prosperity 's torch logo .Using iPads , they had spent the morning asking voters to take an issues survey that included the federal health law , government spending and taxes . The information helps them develop messages and test which arguments resonate with voters .`` That does n't mean always knocking on the door and telling people 'Obamacare ' is bad , '' Phillips told the volunteers . `` That 's important , but the goal is to bring some good and build relationships over the long term . ''That strategy has become central to the Koch network of organizations . This year , they are trying to help Republicans pick up the six seats they need to win control of the Senate  Americans for Prosperity spent $ 25 million on TV ads alone  but it is not what drives the organization .`` People say our biggest goal is a Republican Senate . Not true , '' Phillips said . `` Florida is our biggest imprint . ''As the Nov. 4 vote nears , it 's all about voter-to-voter contacts , relationships that could pay dividends in 2016 and beyond .That means sending hundreds of staff and volunteers into neighborhoods , like the one in Miami packed with pastel homes with Spanish-tile roofs .Malave , the group 's Hispanic outreach chief in Florida , spent more than three hours knocking on doors in the scorching sun on a recent Tuesday . He kept asking the questions and punching in the answers on his iPad so leaders at headquarters could figure out which messages were working .Reaction from voters was mixed and answers came in a blend of English and Spanish . But , as Malave asked about the health law and government spending , he found a few potential recruits .`` I 'm a registered Democrat , '' one woman told Malave , `` but with the situation going on , I 'm in the middle . ''Malave recorded the answers and moved to the next house .`` This is n't glamorous work , '' Malave said , sweating through a polo shirt . `` But you 've got to go where the folks are . People are n't going to come to you . ''___Elliott reported from Washington .___"
1	"MIAMI  When Florida 's Republican governor , Rick Scott , walked into a bustling campaign field office late last month in Hialeah , a heavily Hispanic suburb of Miami , he was mobbed by volunteers hoping to be photographed with the candidate .`` Hey , beautiful , I got a lot of votes for you today , '' called out Rosa Peralta , a retired Cuban immigrant with accented English sitting by a phone bank with a plate of Cuban pastries .Scott 's campaign is making an unprecedented push for Hispanic votes in this year 's gubernatorial race in the nation 's largest swing state . The failure to pay enough attention to the fastest-growing segment of the state 's electorate may have cost the party victory in Florida in the 2012 presidential election , Republican leaders acknowledge .`` We made a point from Day One to make a Hispanic component part of everything we do on the campaign . Not just in Miami but all across the state , '' said Tim Saler , Scott 's deputy campaign manager .If the Republican strategy succeeds , it will signal a major turning back of a trend , with Hispanics favoring Democrats in recent years - and will likely spell defeat for Scott 's Democratic rival , former Governor Charlie Crist .Republicans have always been able to count on older Cuban voters like Peralta , 73 , who fled the Fidel Castro-led revolution in 1960 . But analysts question whether they have done enough to woo non-Cuban Hispanics , including a large influx of Democrat-leaning Puerto Ricans , as well as half a million lower-income Cuban immigrants over the past decade .`` Hispanics are really coming into the Florida electorate at a very fast rate , and they are much more likely to register Democrat , '' said Matt Barreto , a political scientist at the University of Washington and co-founder of the polling and research firm Latino Decisions .Since Scott squeaked out a 60,000-vote victory in 2010 over Democrat Alex Sink , the former state chief financial officer , some 714,000 voters had been added to the electorate , according to the Florida Division of Elections .Of those , 310,000 , or about 44 percent , are Hispanic , even though they make up only 17 percent of the state 's 12 million voters . Whites accounted for less than 25 percent of new registrations , though they represent more than 65 percent of the voting population .Among Hispanic registered voters , 471,000 are Republicans and 662,000 are Democrats , a wider gap - more than 11 percent - than in 2010 , according to a report by the Pew Hispanic Trust .That may explain why Scott mounted the biggest and earliest Spanish-language TV ad campaign in Florida history , starting in April . He even took some language classes and regularly breaks into halting Spanish at campaign stops .This week his campaign began running ads in which former Governor Jeb Bush , a fluent Spanish speaker with a Mexican-born wife , urges people to vote for the Republican who produces `` resultados . ''Both Scott and Crist have Hispanic running mates , another Florida first , each drawing from their strengths in South Florida 's Hispanic community .Scott picked a Cuban American , Carlos Lopez-Cantera , a state legislator from Miami well known in conservative Cuban circles , while Crist chose a Colombian-Jewish businesswoman , Annette Taddeo , also from Miami .Crist holds a 53-29 percent lead over Scott among Hispanics , according to a recent poll by Latino Decisions , suggesting Scott 's campaign has made few inroads .Democrats are counting on new Hispanic neighborhoods in central Florida such as Buenaventura Lakes , a fast-growing community of middle-class Puerto Ricans .Miguel Fontanez , 26 , owner of Piocos Chicken Deli & Bakery , said Scotts budget cuts have hurt needy kids in Buenaventura Lakes .Back when Charlie Crist was running it , there was more money for kids ,  he said .In this region , the Affordable Care Act , known as Obamacare , is far more popular than with white voters , and the Republican-dominated state legislature 's decision to reject federally subsidized Medicaid expansion does not sit well .Democrats say Republicans have failed to tailor their message to Hispanics , focusing on economic issues such as economic growth , job creation and more affordable college tuition .`` Our message does n't change depending on what demographic we are talking to , '' said Lopez-Cantera during a morning of campaign stops in Miami visiting Medicare health centers . `` I just say it in Spanish . ''Democrats take the opposite tack and say the state 's lower-income Hispanics have different priorities , highlighting Scott 's slashing of funding for education in his first year in office .`` I speak the language , but in the end if you dont believe in certain things like public education you arent going to appeal to the ( Hispanic ) community , '' said Taddeo .( Addtional reporting by Barbara Liston .

But analysts question whether they have done enough to woo non-Cuban Hispanics , including a large influx of Democrat-leaning Puerto Ricans , as well as half a million lower-income Cuban immigrants over the past decade .`` Hispanics are really coming into the Florida electorate at a very fast rate , and they are much more likely to register Democrat , '' said Matt Barreto , a political scientist at the University of Washington and co-founder of the polling and research firm Latino Decisions .Since Scott squeaked out a 60,000-vote victory in 2010 over Democrat Alex Sink , the former state chief financial officer , some 714,000 voters had been added to the electorate , according to the Florida Division of Elections .Of those , 310,000 , or about 44 percent , are Hispanic , even though they make up only 17 percent of the state 's 12 million voters . Whites accounted for less than 25 percent of new registrations , though they represent more than 65 percent of the voting population .Among Hispanic registered voters , 471,000 are Republicans and 662,000 are Democrats , a wider gap - more than 11 percent - than in 2010 , according to a report by the Pew Hispanic Trust .That may explain why Scott mounted the biggest and earliest Spanish-language TV ad campaign in Florida history , starting in April . He even took some language classes and regularly breaks into halting Spanish at campaign stops .This week his campaign began running ads in which former Governor Jeb Bush , a fluent Spanish speaker with a Mexican-born wife , urges people to vote for the Republican who produces `` resultados . ''Both Scott and Crist have Hispanic running mates , another Florida first , each drawing from their strengths in South Florida 's Hispanic community .Scott picked a Cuban American , Carlos Lopez-Cantera , a state legislator from Miami well known in conservative Cuban circles , while Crist chose a Colombian-Jewish businesswoman , Annette Taddeo , also from Miami .Crist holds a 53-29 percent lead over Scott among Hispanics , according to a recent poll by Latino Decisions , suggesting Scott 's campaign has made few inroads .Democrats are counting on new Hispanic neighborhoods in central Florida such as Buenaventura Lakes , a fast-growing community of middle-class Puerto Ricans .Miguel Fontanez , 26 , owner of Piocos Chicken Deli & Bakery , said Scotts budget cuts have hurt needy kids in Buenaventura Lakes .Back when Charlie Crist was running it , there was more money for kids ,  he said .In this region , the Affordable Care Act , known as Obamacare , is far more popular than with white voters , and the Republican-dominated state legislature 's decision to reject federally subsidized Medicaid expansion does not sit well .Democrats say Republicans have failed to tailor their message to Hispanics , focusing on economic issues such as economic growth , job creation and more affordable college tuition .`` Our message does n't change depending on what demographic we are talking to , '' said Lopez-Cantera during a morning of campaign stops in Miami visiting Medicare health centers . `` I just say it in Spanish . ''Democrats take the opposite tack and say the state 's lower-income Hispanics have different priorities , highlighting Scott 's slashing of funding for education in his first year in office .`` I speak the language , but in the end if you dont believe in certain things like public education you arent going to appeal to the ( Hispanic ) community , '' said Taddeo .( Addtional reporting by Barbara Liston .

1	"MIAMI  With the promise of affordable health insurance under President Barack Obama 's law , many Americans with serious illnesses are finding relatively low monthly premiums and , in many cases , access to insurance for the first time .But some have been shocked at how much their prescriptions are costing as insurers are creating complex drug tiers and in some cases charging co-insurance rates as high as 50 percent , leaving patients on the hook for thousands .Avalere Health , a market research and consulting firm , estimates some consumers will pay 50 percent of the cost of their specialty drugs  that compares to about 30 percent in the private market ."
1	"MILWAUKEE  A federal judge has thrown out a U.S . Senator 's legal challenge to a part of President Barack Obama 's healthcare law that grants health insurance subsidies for members of Congress and their staffs .U.S . Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin had challenged the right of the federal government to continue making employer contributions to Congressional health insurance plans even when lawmakers and their staff purchase coverage through new Obamacare online exchanges .U.S. District Judge William Griesbach , in Green Bay , dismissed the lawsuit on Monday , saying Johnson had failed to show he had been harmed by the regulation .`` There is nothing in the Constitution stipulating that all wrongs must have remedies , much less that the remedy must lie in federal court , '' Griesbach , who was appointed by former President George W. Bush , said in his decision .The 2010 Affordable Care Act , commonly known as Obamacare , has been the subject of years of political and legal attacks by Republicans , including unsuccessful bids to repeal it .Monday 's ruling comes less than four months before elections in which Republicans seek to expand their House majority and win control of the Senate from Obama 's fellow Democrats .After the ruling , Johnson said he still believed the Obama administration was exceeding its legal authority .`` ( It ) violated its own signature healthcare law by giving special treatment to members of Congress and their staffs , '' he said in a statement .`` I believe that this executive action by the Obama administration is unlawful and unfair , and that it is only one of many examples of this president 's abuse of his constitutional duty . ''The U.S. Supreme Court , in a 2012 ruling , upheld the law 's `` individual mandate '' , a core provision requiring most Americans obtain health insurance by 2014 or pay a penalty .The law also created new online marketplaces where Americans can shop for and buy insurance , with the goal of expanding coverage for uninsured and underinsured people ."
1	"MINNEAPOLIS  Minnesota Democrats Governor Mark Dayton and Senator Al Franken bucked a national trend on Tuesday , winning election to second terms as Republicans clinched a majority in the U.S. Senate and rolled to gubernatorial victories , Reuters/Ipsos projected .Dayton , 67 , defeated county commissioner Jeff Johnson and Franken , who won election to the Senate by just 312 votes six years ago , had a 200,000 vote margin on challenger Mike McFadden with most precincts reporting .`` Minnesotans did n't know what to expect of me when I went to the Senate . But they saw me work hard , '' Franken told reporters when asked why his margin was so much stronger this year after thanking supporters for taking a chance on him six years ago .Dayton , a former U.S. senator who was narrowly elected governor four years ago , campaigned on his move to raise the state 's minimum wage , fund all-day kindergarten and eliminate a state budget deficit .`` I 've supported the causes I believe in , '' Dayton told supporters . `` I will remain true to those causes and principles , always . ''Johnson , 47 , a former corporate lawyer at Cargill and a county commissioner , criticized Dayton 's rollout of the state 's healthcare website . As a county commissioner , Johnson often voted against spending projects , including a light-rail line .Dayton in his first term successfully pressed for a new Minnesota Vikings football stadium , which is now under construction and scheduled to host a Super Bowl in four years , and other projects .Although best known as a comedian and writer for `` Saturday Night Live , '' Franken , 63 , served his first term as a low-key senator and a vocal opponent of a U.S. Supreme Court decision that gave corporations greater political freedom in campaigns .McFadden , 50 , a former investment banker , sought to gain name recognition with television commercials that depicted him as an everyday guy .In one ad , McFadden pretended to coach preteen football players who tell viewers `` Washington is fumbling our future '' and `` Obamacare needs to be sacked .

1	"MONTGOMERY , Ala.  State Sen. Billy Beasley says it was the highest of compliments when a friend recently called him a `` true Democrat . ''The 74-year-old pharmacist also might soon be the only white Democrat left in the Alabama Senate , unless 30-year veteran Sen. Roger Bedford can make up a 60-vote deficit in an anticipated election recount .White , Deep South Democrats have been on the decline for years , and none remain in Congress after Rep. John Barrow of Georgia was defeated Nov. 4 . Their demise was perhaps nowhere more apparent than at the Alabama Statehouse , where the number of white Democrats in the 140-member legislature was cut in half from 14 to 7 on Election Day .`` They are not extinct . You can find some examples , but you really almost need a magnifying glass to find the Caucasian Democratic candidate , '' Jess Brown , a political scientist at Athens State University , said .Democrats dominated the so-called Solid South from Reconstruction to the middle of the twentieth century .The realignment began with Southerners ' opposition to the Civil Rights Act 1964 . What followed was a Goldwater-wave of several Southern states voting for Republicans ' presidential nominee for the first time . It was sped along with the popularity of President Ronald Reagan and Southerners ' identification with the GOP 's stances on issues from abortion to guns .`` Democrats , when they were winning , would often say to voters , we 're not like those national Democrats . But there was no alternative , '' said Natalie Davis , a political scientist and pollster at Birmingham-Southern College .Southern voters identify themselves with the Republican Party on issues across the board , from education and social issues to disdain for President Barack Obama 's signature health care law , said Alabama Republican Party Chairman Bill Armistead .`` The core of the Democratic Party has gotten more liberal , said Sen. Gerald Dial , a Lineville legislator who switched to the Republican Party .Dial represented his east Alabama district as a Democrat for 20 years before switching to the GOP in 2010 . He said the Republican Party better reflected the views of people in his district , which sweeps through east Alabama 's farms and textile mills .`` Our communities are just more conservative , very patriotic , very religious oriented - I guess we 've got more churches , I know I have a lot in my district . Add to that the philosophy of smaller government and low taxes , '' Dial said .Beasley said Republicans have successfully made state elections about national issues that legislators ca n't do anything about . `` They ran against Obama . They ran against ( House Minority Leader Nancy ) Pelosi and ( Senate Majority Leader Harry ) Reid . Those are national figures , '' Beasley said .He said state politicians should be talking about health care , education and jobs .Even as white Southerners began voting Republican in presidential and statewide races , statehouses had remained a Democratic stronghold until recently . Republicans won their first GOP majority since Reconstruction in 2010 . More Democrats abandoned their party to be part of the new ruling majority .The fall of white Democrats has resulted in parties that have become increasingly divided along party lines .`` Now we 've got down to a situation where you have blacks in the Democratic Party in the Legislature , at least in the Senate , and you have whites in the Republican Party . What that does it take us one step closer to the past , and that 's not good in my point of view , '' said Sen. Hank Sanders , D-Selma , who is black .Sanders said the result is that African-American voters feel the sting . The percentage of black legislators is roughly proportionate to the general population . But their party 's dwindling numbers means fewer opportunities for minority legislators to exert influence , he said .Beasley likely survived because he represents a district that is 60 percent black , as African-Americans are a reliably Democratic voting bloc .Democrats say they see hope for regaining ground in the region that spawned Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter .Part of the answer is getting beyond the presidency of Barack Obama , who is deeply unpopular among white voters in the South , said John Anzalone , an Alabama-based pollster and consultant . Anzalone has worked from Democrats ranging from President Barack Obama to Jason Carter , the grandson of Jimmy Carter who unsuccessfully ran this year for Georgia governor .`` There are a lot of non-college-educated , white Southern voters that agree with Democrats on a lot of issues like the minimum wage and access to health care , as long as you do n't call it Obamacare , '' Anzalone said .The GOP dominance means primary battles push some candidates further to the right , he said , which could provide an opening for Democrats if Republicans become even more conservative than their voting base .But as Democrats look for ways to regain white voters , Republicans are trying to court black voters .Several black Republicans ran for office this year , though all lost . Still , it 's likely an African-American Republican will be elected in the near future , predicted Phillip Brown , chairman of the Alabama Republican Minority Party . Brown ran for a seat on the state utility regulatory board and lost .`` We overcame a milestone this year , and that was to actually have a substantial number of minorities run under the banner of the Republican Party , '' Brown said ."
1	"Making good on a campaign promise , House Republicans will take a vote to repeal the Obama administrations health care on Jan. 12 , the week after their party takes the reins of the House .Obamacare is a job killer for businesses small and large , and the top priority for House Republicans is going to be to cut spending and grow the economy and jobs ,  said Brad Dayspring , a spokesman for Eric Cantor , the incoming majority leader . Further , ObamaCare failed to lower costs as the president promised that it would and does not allow people to keep the care they currently have if they like it . That is why the House will repeal it next week.In order to comply with new House rules governing transparency in bills , the new Republican Majority will post legislation to repeal the health care law Monday evening at http : //rules-republicans.house.gov/Default.aspx .House Democrats said they will defend the law , and Senate Democrats would almost certainly block a repeal bill from coming to a vote . Even if both the House and Senate were to approve a repeal , President Obama would veto such a bill . But the move is pregnant with symbolic meaning for Republicans , who have used the health-care law as a symbol of Democratic overreach and overspending"
1	"Many of us wish that Obamacare were a simpler system , one that directly provided health insurance . Political reality , unfortunately , ensured that many people will receive coverage from private insurers , selling policies  often with subsidies  on the exchanges . And naturally enough , the Obama administration is teaming up with the insurers and other parts of the health industry to help inform Americans of the benefits to which they will be legally entitled , starting Jan. 1 .And in the eyes of Republicans , Bloomberg reports , this makes Obama a bully  dragooning those private companies into helping sell a public program that will increase their profits . Why , its tyranny , I tell you !Yes , its ridiculous . But they cant help themselves . I suspect that the idea of helping lower-income Americans in any way would drive the GOP bonkers ; but the idea that this help might come from Obama ( implementing a program originally designed by Republicans , but never mind ) , and that Obamas plan might actually work , drives them crazy ."
1	"Matt Yglesias has kicked up a mini-commotion with a piece hailing any potential Obamacare-driven cuts to physician income as basically exactly the medicine our overpriced medical system needs . Heres his argument: American doctors get paid more than doctors in any other country . Given how much of health care is financed either directly ( Medicare , Medicaid , Veterans Affairs , public-sector workers ) or indirectly ( tax subsidy for employer-provided insurance ) by the federal government , its natural to make restraining doctors income part of any program for making health care more affordable . So when you read stories about doctors whining that Affordable Care Act exchange plans dont pay them enough , please throw up a little in your mouth and proceed to ignore the doctors complaints . The only practical reason to worry about low compensation for doctors in the ACA exchanges is it may cause them to boycott exchange patients . If that happens , the solution is to reduce doctors payment rates elsewhere in the system . If we ever reach the point where American doctors have been squeezed so badly that they start fleeing north of the border to get higher pay in Canada , then weve squeezed too hard . Until that happens , forget about it . What we really ought to be doing is working to further pressure the incomes of doctors through supply-side reforms . That means letting nurse practitioners treat patients without kicking a slice upstairs to an M.D. , letting more doctors immigrate to the United States , and opening more medical schools . Common sense says that since the population both grows and ages over time , there should be more people admitted to medical school today than were 30 years ago . But thats not the case . Instead we produce roughly the same number of new doctors , admissions standards have gotten tougher , and doctors have become scarcer .Youll note a slight difference in both tone and substance between the first paragraph ( where Yglesias sounds like , shall we say , a particularly hepped-up MSNBC host ranting against the selfish Republican-voting rich ) and the second paragraph ( where he sounds more like Milton Friedman , who once described of the American Medical Association as the strongest trade union in the United States ) . For a heterodox liberal writing mostly for mostly partisan audience , its a savvy way to structure an argument : Come for the defense of the Affordable Care Act ( and to watch the outrage from conservatives who like their doctor and mistakenly imagine that ours is a free market in medical services ) , and stay for a little unconventional , even right-of-center wisdom about the problem with government-subsidized cartels and the uses of deregulation .But Im not sure the combination holds together analytically . If supply-side reforms are the real answer to the problem of inflated medical salaries ( and Im pretty sure they are ) then should we be praising a policy , Obamacare , that tries to restrain salaries and payments by fiat instead ? Jokes about doctors fleeing to Canada notwithstanding , unless Democrats have a plan to completely nationalize health care theres still going to be somewhere else for the best physicians to go : They can stop participating in public plans , stop participating in exchange plans , and and then eventually stop taking insurance entirely and just opt to serve an exclusively upper middle class clientele via concierge medicine . And if you combine this opting-opt out at the top of the talent distribution with the fact that Obamacare will presumably dramatically expand the demand for physician services for the newly-subsidized , you have a recipe for basically importing Medicaids existing access and quality-of-care problems into the rest of the publicly-subsidized insurance market .Would this shift also restrain doctor salaries ( or the average doctors salary , at least ) , and with them , medical costs ? Well , yes , to some extent it might  and so in a sense , this is just taking us back into the ideologically-charged debate over whether Medicaid for all would be a good idea or not . But its noteworthy that Yglesiass nominally liberal and pro-Obamacare piece actually suggests a very different prescription ( and yes , admittedly , one that many A.M.A.-funded Republicans would oppose ) than the Medicaid-for-most model that Obamacare might end up delivering . Hes basically acknowledging that what we actually need is medical-industry deregulation to counteract the market-distorting impact of a heavily-subsidized medical cartel , but then still embracing as a second-best option a policy that answers that cartel with wage and price controls instead , essentially piling a new set of distortions on top of the old set in the hopes that they cancel each other out . And given his own analysis of the underlying dynamics , I think its reasonable to doubt whether that second-best solution is really much of a solution at all ."
1	"Midterm election season is , for many , mercifully approaching the finish line . Looking ahead to 2015 , if poll averages are correct and Republicans do take control of the Senate  Vox.coms average of several sites puts it at a 68 percent chance of happening  what can Americans expect ?More of the same  of the wildly unpopular grind  is entirely possible . After all , we have divided government now , and we will still have divided government if Republicans go from 45 senators to 51 . Obama will still be in the White House , and the House of Representatives will still belong to the GOP ,  Molly Ball writes for The Atlantic .But perhaps surprisingly , many observers suggest that we could alternatively expect quite a lot  at least by the standards of the past few years , i.e. , a sinkhole of inaction ,  in the words of Howard Fineman . And many point to election year 2016 as the motivating factor .Regaining the Senate would finally give the G.O.P . the opportunity , going into 2016 , to demonstrate its capacity to govern ,  Charles Krauthammer writes at The Washington Post .And the White House , according to reporting from Edward-Isaac Dovere at Politico , also sees some 2016 leverage , pointing to the Repubilcan senators up for re-election that year .As bad as the electoral map for Democrats is this year , the map for Republicans in 2016 is even worse ,  Mr. Dovere writes . The vulnerable Republican senators would be under pressure to move toward the middle and be the bridge to larger deals with a caucus eager to show it can get things done.For the Republicans , Mr. Krauthammer urges them to enact a bold reform agenda and dare the president to veto it . Show the country what you stand for . Then take it to the nation in 2016. This could include tax reform ( corporate and individual ) , border security , energy deregulation and health care .Others have pointed to potential areas of deal making like trade pacts , such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership , and infrastructure  at least the Keystone XL pipeline .The theory being , according Ms. Ball , that Republicans will stop the Obama agenda by proposing their own agenda  one thats realistic and palatable enough that Obama will agree to it.And at the center of any deal making  assuming he wins his re-election race and becomes majority leader  is Mitch McConnell . The Kentucky senator emphasized this aspect in a recent debate with his Democratic opponent , Alison Lundergan Grimes : There have been three major bipartisan agreements during the Obama years between Republicans and Democrats ,  Mr. McConnell said . The vice president and I have negotiated every one of them ( these were the 2010 deal to extend the Bush tax cuts , the 2011 deal to raise the debt ceiling and fiscal-cliff deal of 2013 ) .George Will at The Washington Post sees Mr. McConnells role as central to what he sees as the restoration of the Senate to its rightful place in the Washington firmament : In January , in the most statesmanlike Senate speech in years , McConnell explained how , under Republican leadership , the Senate would be restored as the creator of consensus:An executive order cant [ create consensus ] . The fiat of a nine-person court cant do it . A raucous and precarious partisan majority in the House cant do it . The only institution that can make stable and enduring laws is the one we have in which all 50 states are represented equally , and where every single senator has a say in the laws that we pass.Yet other observers do not see Mr. McConnell and his leadership with quite the same glow . Jonathan Chait at New York magazine has seen the same speeches as Mr. Will  particular Mr. McConnells view of Senate rule changes under Harry Reid , the current majority leader  but does not find them nearly as convincingly sanguine . He writes : The source of McConnells apparent indignation is changes made to Senate rules by Reid . The Democratic leader has made it hard for Republicans to amend legislation , forcing them into up-or-down votes on bills of Reids choosing . And more provocative , he eliminated the filibuster on federal court nominations and executive branch appointments . McConnell claims he will undo this , restoring the Senate to its grandeur.It is possible McConnell actually believes this , Mr. Chait says , but there is almost no chance he will follow through on it. He writes , The reason the majority party likes to control what bills and amendments can come to the floor is that it prefers to highlight issues where it holds a political advantage and obscure issues where their opponents do.Annie Lowrey , also at New York magazine , sees much less creator of consensus and much more manager of conflict between parties . She sees Republicans unable to pass legislation  Democrats could filibuster in the Senate or the president could veto any bill  without compromise . But theres still a way for Republicans to get their priorities onto President Obamas desk , she writes : They can attach them to budget legislation and pass it through a process immune to the filibuster known as reconciliation.President Obama is faced with the choice of approving a budget larded with Republican priorities he hates , or using his veto power  and thus potentially shutting down the government or even precipitating another debt-ceiling crisis ,  Ms. Lowrey says .Steven Mufson at The Washington Post also sees partisan strife : The Republican plan for next year isnt about congressional harmony but is mainly aimed at discrediting the Obama record , defining a new conservative vision , and building an appealing Republican platform for the 2016 presidential election.Ms. Lowrey concludes : The next two years might look a lot like the last two years , with legislating grinding to a halt and the occasional shutdown or debt-ceiling scare . Democrats and Republicans agree on very little . There is scant evidence of anyone pivoting to the center . The choke points shift , but persist.Some observers on the right dont disagree with this but of course see it in a different light . Erick Erickson at Red State says , The G.O.P . would be wise to target Obamacare for destruction and begin , finally , investigating the Obama Administrations attempts to politicize all aspects of the federal bureaucracy .Voters distrust big government ,  he adds . Republicans should , assuming they win the Senate , begin exposing all the ills of Barack Obamas big government.Hugh Hewitt at Washington Examiner urges Republicans to act with true urgency and boldness if they win the Senate . Pass the G.O.P . budget on day one , having negotiated its particulars between House and Senate GOP in November and December .On day two , both Houses should pass a Defense Appropriations bill adequate to the pressing needs of the Pentagon  again negotiated between House and Senate during the two months between elections and the new Congress convening  and send it to the president , defining by deeds what makes the new G.O.P . Congress different from either divided government or the 2007 to 2010 years of Pelosi-Reid.Yet should Republicans get ambitious , Ms. Ball sees an additional obstacle : The biggest obstacle will be Republicans themselves  chiefly the restive conservatives in the House , who have prevented consideration of bipartisan legislation approved by the Senate on issues like immigration and who have often prevented the party from doing whats in its own political interest ( see : government shutdown ) .But first , Election Day , when questions of which party controls what are answered  or at least hopefully answered , unless it goes into overtime ."
1	"Mike Konczal says most of what needs to be said about the underlying sources of Obamacares complexity , which in turn set the stage for the current tech problems . Basically , Obamacare isnt complicated because government social insurance programs have to be complicated : neither Social Security nor Medicare are complex in structure . Its complicated because political constraints made a straightforward single-payer system unachievable .Its been clear all along that the Affordable Care Act sets up a sort of Rube Goldberg device , a complicated system that in the end is supposed to more or less simulate the results of single-payer , but keeping private insurance companies in the mix and holding down the headline amount of government outlays through means-testing . This doesnt make it unworkable : state exchanges are working , and healthcare.gov will probably get fixed before the whole thing kicks in . But it did make a botched rollout much more likely .So Konczal is right to say that the implementation problems arent revealing problems with the idea of social insurance ; theyre revealing the price we pay for insisting on keeping insurance companies in the mix , when they serve little useful purpose .So does this mean that liberals should have insisted on single-payer or nothing ? No . Single-payer wasnt going to happen  partly because of the insurance lobbys power , partly because voters wouldnt have gone for a system that took away their existing coverage and replaced it with the unknown . Yes , Obamacare is a somewhat awkward kludge , but if thats what it took to cover the uninsured , so be it .And although the botched rollout is infuriating  count me among those who believe that liberals best serve their own cause by admitting that , not trying to cover for the botch  the odds remain high that this will work , and make America a much better place ."

The deal is a significant vote of confidence in Motif , which received an investment from Goldman Sachs last year .The investors in the financing round included Wicklow Capital , a fund formed by Daniel Tierney and Stephen Schuler . The two men co-founded the high-frequency trading firm Getco ( which merged with Knight Capital last year ) . Balderton Capital , a European venture capital firm , also invested .A representative of JPMorgan is expected to join Motif Investings board as a nonvoting member , the company said . The board also includes Sallie L. Krawcheck , a former big bank executive ; Arthur Levitt Jr. , a former Securities and Exchange Commission chairman ; and Darren W. Cohen , a Goldman managing director , who , like the JPMorgan representative , does not get to vote .While Motif Investing and JPMorgan declined to discuss details of their talks , the investment appears to be a strategic one . Motif may be hoping to gain access at some point to JPMorgans vast customer base .Its always helpful to have companies that understand the financial markets , that are serving on our board as observers ,  Hardeep Walia , the chief executive of Motif Investing , said in an interview . Theres always value to having companies like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan.Mr. Levitt , who works as an adviser to Goldman , put it this way : Hardeep is mining the fields thoroughly in terms of seeing whether any of his investors are able to be strategic and create opportunities that are commercial , not merely passive investors.Motif Investing , based in San Mateo , Calif. , opened its doors in 2012 . The company lets investors buy a basket of stocks centered on a theme , like robotic revolution ,  seven deadly sins or Obamacare ( Repeal Obamacare is also available ) . Investors can also create their own themes . The company charges $ 9.95 for a so-called motif , a portfolio of up to 30 stocks .Separately on Thursday , the firm announced a new product geared toward financial advisers , offering a way for advisers to monitor and rebalance their clients portfolios . The service will charge advisers a monthly fee per customer .Phil Di Iorio , chief executive of JPMorgans global wealth management business , said in a statement that Motif is driving powerful innovations in the wealth management segment.Mr. Walias vision has clearly resonated with the bank .

1	"Much of the political chatter of the day has been about the impact of the Supreme Courts ruling on the presidential campaign . But the courts decision to let stand President Obamas health care plan may hold even more import in the battle for control of the Senate .Republicans on Capitol Hill vowed on Thursday to repeal the health care law . But the truth is they can only do that if they control both chambers of Congress .In 2010 , anger over the health care law helped fuel a Republican wave that gave the party control of the House . If the court had overturned the health care law , that intensity might have faded .But now , conservative activists say they will be fired up again to do whatever is necessary to get rid of Obamacare ,  and winning the Senate will be crucial . The could fuel a surge in attack ads about health care financed by third-party groups and aimed squarely at Democrats who voted for the health care law .The last time Obamacare was litigated in a general election , Republicans picked up an historic number of seats in the U.S. House and made big gains in the U.S. Senate ,  said Jonathan Collegio , a spokesman for American Crossroads , a conservative group which that some health care ads in 2010 .He added : The Supreme Court effectively made the 2012 elections the most important in a century , and dramatically energized the center-right coalition in the process.The Senator majority leader , Harry Reid of Nevada , said on the Senate floor that Republicans should move past the issue .Its time , though , for Republicans to stop refighting yesterdays battles ,  Mr. Reid said . Now that this matter is settled , lets move on to other things like jobs.Judging from the reaction among conservative groups , that appears unlikely ."
1	"My Campaign Stops column this week discusses why Rick Santorum is proving a more troublesome adversary for the frontrunner than all the not-Romneys before him: Santorums advantage is that he can get to Romneys right and to his left at once . On the one hand , Santorum isnt responsible for a health care bill that looks an awful lot like Obamacare and he doesnt have a long list of social-issue flip-flops in his past . This makes his candidacy a plausible rallying point for the voters who previously turned Bachmann and Cain and the pre-debate Rick Perry into conservative flavors of the month .At the same time , though , Santorums persona , his record and his platform all have a populist tinge that plays well in states like Michigan , Ohio and Pennsylvania , where swing voters tend to be socially conservative but economically middle-of-the-road . ( Hence the Michigan poll that showed him leading among independents and Democrats who plan to vote in that states open primary . )This means that Santorum can play the same anti-Bain , anti-rich-guy , blue-collar card that Gingrich tried to play in New Hampshire and South Carolina  but subtly , implicitly , in ways that dont make him sound like he belongs in Occupy Wall Street instead of the Republican primary .Read the rest here ."
1	"My Sunday column closed with a warning to conservatives that Obamacare  at least in some form  may turn out to be more durable than its disastrous rollout would seem to suggest , because the nature of the welfare state means that even programs that dont live up to their promises can be awfully hard to dislodge . ( As a case in point , see the outcome of the weekends House election in Louisiana , where the anti-establishment , right-wing , Duck Dynasty-endorsed winner was also  in favor of Obamacares Medicaid expansion . )For an example of why conservatives should be interested in dislodging it , though , let me take up Jonathan Chaits latest brief against the potential Republican alternatives to Obamacare , which hes been arguing would necessarily be much more unpopular than the current , not-exactly-popular reform:The Republicans triumphant plan for ideological conquest ignores some massive obstacles . The first is that , while people with individual insurance may not like the prospect of losing their plan with no easily obtainable alternative , people with employer-based insurance like the prospect of losing their plan a lot less . Conservatives propose to cap the tax deduction for employer-based insurance  That sounds nice in theory . In reality , it means squeezing not millions but tens of millions of happily insured workers into skimpier plans , or plans with higher premiums , or onto the individual market . The scale of the disruption from that one change alone would dwarf the keep your plan complaints .Second , conservatives may prefer an individualized market where healthy people get cheap , bare-bones insurance . But Americans overwhelmingly prefer more comprehensive insurance . Employer-based insurance , which charges young , healthy workers the exact same rate as older , sicker ones , is the most redistributive form of insurance , and also the most popular kind by far  The Republican plan is to move as many people as possible from the kind of insurance they like to the kind of insurance they hate . Obamas plan is to make unpopular individual health insurance more like the popular employer-based health insurance , with lots of cross-subsidies from healthy to sick . The conservative plans propose to make popular employer insurance more like the unpopular individual market .Ive already been over the issue of whether the cap-and-subsidize approach would actually be more disruptive than Obamacare , and at the very least its a harder question to answer than Chait breezily suggests ( not least because Obamacare also tries to cap the tax deduction , albeit in a much more limited way , and includes many other disruptive provisions as well ) . But his point about the popularity of employer-provided insurance deserves a response in its own right , because it cuts to the heart of what might turn out to be the perverse consequences of a fully-operational Obamacare .So its true , as Chait says , that people generally like employer-provided insurance , and that they like it , in part , because of the way risk pooling works in the employer market . But mostly they like it because , well , nobody realizes what their employer-provided insurance actually costs . As Josh Barro put it recently: Conservatives like , for good reason , to talk about fiscal illusion : When the costs of government programs are hidden , people will tend to support them even if they are not worth the price . Because our system of health insurance contains so much cost shifting and so many hidden subsidies , we suffer from premium illusion : People love their employer-provided coverage because they have no idea how much its costing them .In other words , the individual market is relatively unpopular because its transparent and people pay up front , whereas the coverage that you get through your employer involves costs that people dont see and dont have a way to tally up  mostly because they come off the top of wages without the wage-earner actually realizing its happening . They may realize something is happening : The wage stagnation , driven in part by health care costs , thats kept median incomes growing at an at-best-unimpressive pace since the 1970s is an important source of angst and insecurity and disillusionment and diminished expectations . But the link between wages and employer-provided health benefits , while significant , is not exactly widely understood  because , again , nobody knows what their employer-based insurance actually costs .So to say , as Chait does , that Obamacare will make the individual market more like the popular employer-based health insurance  well , in some ways it might , but given the employer markets role as a driver of cost inflation thats not necessarily an advertisement for the wisdom of the policy .Its true that in the best-case scenario for the law , the employer market and the individual market would converge in a productive way : The Cadillac tax on high-value plans would make people in the employer market feel a little more of the real cost of insurance , the exchanges would create larger individual-market risk pools and more competition for individual-market dollars , and both sectors would end up looking a little bit more like the other in a positive-sum , cost-containing fashion . ( As I understand it , this is basically the scenario that Barro , a supporter of the law , is hoping for . )But the danger right now is that instead of this happy convergence , were going to get a worst-of-both-worlds scenario , in which the reformed individual market ends up taking on some of the pathologies of the employer market while also seeing its own existing problems exacerbated . By this I mean that the bottom , heavily-subsidized half of the individual market will end up sharing some of the cost-insulating features of employer-provided insurance , with buyers encouraged to choose plans without understanding their true price ( indeed , some of the websites issues can be traced to the administrations desire to make sure that shoppers dont encounter the real unsubsidized prices of their plans ) , while the upper , unsubsidized half of the market gets an even rawer deal than they did before , with higher prices and fewer low-cost choices  and then that combination of cost insulation at the bottom and cost inflation at the top could drive out the healthy buyers the system needs , leaving a less sustainable risk pool than the individual market enjoyed before .If Obamacare ends up being a policy failure , in other words , it will because instead of building on the individual markets strengths it exacerbated some of its weaknesses , and instead of finding most of its cost savings in the overly-subsidized employer market it loaded them onto the backs of individual-market buyers instead .Now maybe  hopefully  it wont come to this . And if it does , I honestly dont know how the politics of a Republican alternative that caps the employer deduction would play out , in 2016 and beyond : Maybe they would be so ugly , on the like your plan/keep your plan front , that the country would prefer to take a Medicaid-for-most road to single payer , or else just keep staggering along the path Obamacare is taking . But even in Chaits ongoing defenses of the reform you can see some of the problems with that path , and the reasons that an alternative should at least be on the table ."

Its about my freshman roommate in college , Scott Androes , who lacked health insurance and preventive care and as a result is now fighting stage IV prostate cancer . Its obviously a tragedy for Scott and those who hold him dear , but its also a reminder of how flawed our health care system is  and of the stakes in this election . Obamacare is far from perfect , but if President Obama is reelected , then beginning in 2014 people like Scott will end up insured through a mandate . If Mitt Romney is elected , then people like Scott will presumably remain uncovered and uninsurable . In the debates , you hear health numbers batted back and forth , but as I see it , whats at stake is ultimately lives like Scotts .Read the column , and Id welcome your thoughts  and a special thanks to Scott for sharing his story , in hopes that it will make a difference to others . Fight on , Scott !"
1	"My parents used to own a small house with a large backyard , in which my mother cultivated a beautiful garden . At some point , however  I dont remember why  my father looked at the official deed defining their property , and received a shock . According to the text , the Krugman lot wasnt a rough rectangle ; it was a triangle more than a hundred feet long but only around a yard wide at the base .On examination , it was clear what had happened : Whoever wrote down the lots description had somehow skipped a clause . And of course the town clerk fixed the language . After all , it would have been ludicrous and cruel to take away most of my parents property on the basis of sloppy drafting , when the drafters intention was perfectly clear .But it now appears possible that the Supreme Court may be willing to deprive millions of Americans of health care on the basis of an equally obvious typo . And if you think this possibility has anything to do with serious legal reasoning , as opposed to rabid partisanship , I have a long , skinny , unbuildable piece of land you might want to buy .Last week the court shocked many observers by saying that it was willing to hear a case claiming that the wording of one clause in the Affordable Care Act sets drastic limits on subsidies to Americans who buy health insurance . Its a ridiculous claim ; not only is it clear from everything else in the act that there was no intention to set such limits , you can ask the people who drafted the law what they intended , and it wasnt what the plaintiffs claim . But the fact that the suit is ridiculous is no guarantee that it wont succeed  not in an environment in which all too many Republican judges have made it clear that partisan loyalty trumps respect for the rule of law .To understand the issue , you need to understand the structure of health reform . The Affordable Care Act tries to establish more-or-less universal coverage through a three-legged stool of policies , all of which are needed to make the system work . First , insurance companies are no longer allowed to discriminate against Americans based on their medical history , so that they cant deny coverage or impose exorbitant premiums on people with pre-existing conditions . Second , everyone is required to buy insurance , to ensure that the healthy dont wait until they get sick to join up . Finally , there are subsidies to lower-income Americans to make the insurance theyre required to buy affordable .Just as an aside , so far this system seems to be working very well . Enrollment is running above expectations , premiums well below , and more insurance companies are flocking to the market .So whats the problem ? To receive subsidies , Americans must buy insurance through so-called exchanges , government-run marketplaces . These exchanges , in turn , take two forms . Many states have chosen to run their own exchanges , like Covered California or Kentuckys Kynect . Other states , however  mainly those under G.O.P . control  have refused to take an active role in insuring the uninsured , and defaulted to exchanges run by the federal government ( which are working well now that the original software problems have been resolved ) .But if you look at the specific language authorizing those subsidies , it could be taken  by an incredibly hostile reader  to say that theyre available only to Americans using state-run exchanges , not to those using the federal exchanges .As I said , everything else in the act makes it clear that this was not the drafters intention , and in any case you can ask them directly , and theyll tell you that this was nothing but sloppy language . Furthermore , the consequences if the suit were to prevail would be grotesque . States like California that run their own exchanges would be unaffected . But in places like New Jersey , where G.O.P . politicians refused to take a role , premiums would soar , healthy individuals would drop out , and health reform would go into a death spiral . ( And since many people would lose crucial , lifesaving coverage , the deaths wouldnt be just a metaphor . )Now , states could avoid this death spiral by establishing exchanges  which might involve nothing more than setting up links to the federal exchange . But how did we get to this point ?Once upon a time , this lawsuit would have been literally laughed out of court . Instead , however , it has actually been upheld in some lower courts , on straight party-line votes  and the willingness of the Supremes to hear it is a bad omen .So lets be clear about whats happening here . Judges who support this cruel absurdity arent stupid ; they know what theyre doing . What they are , instead , is corrupt , willing to pervert the law to serve political masters . And what well find out in the months ahead is how deep the corruption goes ."
1	"NEW ORLEANS  Extending an expensive and largely negative campaign for one more month , voters in Louisiana sent Mary Landrieu , a Democrat and three-term United States senator , and her Republican challenger , United States Representative Bill Cassidy , into a runoff election set for Dec. 6 .Given Louisianas nonpartisan primary system  in which all candidates run in a primary and , if no one wins a majority , the top two vote-getters compete in an election a few weeks later  runoffs are fairly routine here and one had long been expected in this race .While the state Republican Party formally backed Mr. Cassidy this summer , another Republican , Rob Maness , a retired Air Force colonel with a strong Tea Party following , stayed in the race and drew about 14 percent of the vote on Tuesday . Mr , Cassidy received 42 percent of the vote and Ms. Landreau 41 percent .Numerous polls suggest that much of Mr. Manesss support will move to Mr. Cassidy in the runoff , putting him in a strong position to win .Ms. Landrieu is the last Democrat representing a Deep South state in the United States Senate and the last Democrat in office in Louisiana to be elected statewide . She won runoffs in her first and second elections for the Senate , in 1996 and 2002 , though neither by huge margins . Given the rightward drift of the state , and particularly of the once reliably Democratic voters of southern Louisiana , Ms. Landrieu may be facing her toughest Senate election to date .Shes got to find a way to get to 30 percent of white voters , said Roy Fletcher , a Republican political consultant in Baton Rouge . In this headwind , with Obama and et cetera , Im not sure.Her case to the voters has centered on her clout as a long-serving senator , particularly in securing funding for local projects and post-hurricane disaster aid . Highlighting her role as chairwoman of the Senate Energy Committee , she has drawn support and campaign donations from leading figures in the oil and gas industry . Ms. Landrieu has distanced herself from President Obama on energy issues , but Republicans have zeroed in on a number of votes that put her on the same side as the president , who is deeply unpopular here , most notably on the Affordable Care Act .I think people are looking for change ,  said Stacy Crovetto , 55 , a retired schoolteacher who was voting at an elementary school in Luling , La. , midmorning . I think health care is one of the biggest concerns . People are concerned about the changes that Obamacare has made.Mr. Cassidy , a gastroenterologist turned congressman , run most of the race like a front-runner , keeping a relatively low profile and sticking to a script . In the two debates and in many of his campaign ads , Mr. Cassidy repeatedly tied Ms. Landrieu to Mr. Obamas policies ."
1	"NEW ORLEANS  Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota , the latest candidate to join the Republican presidential campaign , suggested Friday that President Obama secretly wanted Medicare to go bankrupt so retirees would be forced to enroll in the new national health care law .This hasnt been talked about very much  the presidents plan for senior citizens is Obamacare ,  Ms. Bachmann told party activists here . She added , I think very likely what the president intends is that Medicare will go broke and ultimately that answer will be Obamacare for senior citizens.In a speech to the Republican Leadership Conference , Ms. Bachmann recounted how she attended a closed-door meeting at the White House and said the president was asked three times to produce his plan to address the financial burdens facing the Medicare program . She said the presidents gift to senior citizens is to steal from them $ 500 billion out of Medicare.The anecdote , which Ms. Bachmann did not explain in detail or offer additional corroboration , was the latest example of a red-meat , crowd-pleasing declaration that has become a theme of her political rise  whether or not the statements withstand scrutiny . She drew enthusiastic applause as she pledged that her top priority  should she reach the White House  would be repealing the health care law .I wonder if theyre listening in the White House right now ,  Ms. Bachmann said . You will , come November of 2012 , youll listen then.Ms. Bachmann , Representative Ron Paul of Texas and former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania were among the Republican presidential candidates speaking Friday to hundreds of party activists here . Ms. Bachmann made repeated references to her performance Monday at the debate in New Hampshire , when she announced her candidacy and drew fresh attention to her bid .She infused humor throughout her speech , repeatedly bringing the audience to its feet .I have to tell you I was a little nervous ,  Ms. Bachmann said . I didnt know if they were going to ask boxers or briefs  a girl never knows . You never know."

This is not over yet , '' he said , urging supporters to stay the course .Landrieu faces a difficult path to re-election , analysts have said .

1	"NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) - When Massachusetts blazed the trail of healthcare reform in 2006 by expanding coverage for the poor and requiring all residents to have health insurance , it may have done more than serve as a model for nationwide reform : it also seemed to save lives , according to a study released on Monday .The findings , reported in the Annals of Internal Medicine , are the first to provide a detailed analysis of the effects of systematically expanding healthcare coverage . Increasing access to Medicaid , the government-run insurance program for the poor , and mandating that everyone have health insurance were the two centerpieces of Massachusetts ' healthcare reform .They are also central to President Barack Obama 's 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act , and remain its most controversial elements . Half the states have refused to expand Medicaid under the law known as Obamacare , for instance , and Republican opponents of the law regularly rail against the individual mandate requiring that individuals buy insurance or pay a penalty .The study 's authors cautioned that their analysis does not prove that Massachusetts 's healthcare overhaul caused the decline in deaths ; all it can show is that the two are correlated .Previous studies that examined whether expanding access to health insurance resulted in fewer deaths got mixed results .The new study compared deaths among people aged 20 to 64 years old in Massachusetts counties before and after `` Romneycare '' ( as the health insurance overhaul is known , since Republican politician Mitt Romney was governor when it became law ) to counties in other states .The years compared were 2001-2005 and 2007-2010 .For every 830 people who became insured as a result of Massachusetts ' mandatory coverage and Medicaid expansion , they calculated , one fewer person died each year .That represents `` a 3 percent decline in the death rate in the first few years after implementation , '' lead author Dr Benjamin Sommers of Harvard School of Public Health in Boston told Reuters Health .In particular , there were fewer deaths from cancer , heart disease and infections , all of which benefit from preventive and regular healthcare , said Sommers . He has served as a senior advisor to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services , the lead Obamacare agency , and continued to serve part-time in an advisory role in 2013-2014 .`` The decline in the death rate of Massachusetts was focused in those areas where you would think reform would make the biggest difference , '' he said .The drop in deaths was also larger in poorer communities that had a high number of uninsured residents before 2006 .Austin Frakt , a health economist with the Department of Veterans Affairs in Jamaica Plain , Massachusetts who was not involved in the new study but wrote an editorial accompanying it , called it `` one of the most relevant studies pertaining to the Affordable Care Act . ''Most such studies do show that health insurance has a positive effect on death rates and health , Frakt told Reuters Health : `` Those findings are out there and the findings are really robust . ''Sommers cautioned that the findings may not apply nationwide . For one thing , Massachusetts has an abundance of doctors and hospitals , many of whom accept the newly insured . Under Obamacare , people whose new insurance is not accepted by many healthcare providers might have coverage on paper but not easy access to healthcare .The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 37 million people will gain health insurance by 2018 through the Affordable Care Act .

Most of the website 's most prominent flaws were eventually remedied .Obama on Thursday announced in the White House briefing room that 8 million people had signed up by the latest enrollment deadline of April 15 .

1	"NEW YORK  An unknown hacker or hackers broke into a computer server supporting the HealthCare.gov website through which consumers enroll in Obamacare health insurance , a government cybersecurity team discovered last week , apparently uploading malicious files .The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , the lead Obamacare agency , briefed key congressional staff on Thursday about the intrusions , the first of which occurred on July 8 , CMS spokesman Aaron Albright said .The malware uploaded to the server was designed to launch a distributed denial of service , or DDoS , attack against other websites , not to steal personal information , Albright said .In a DDoS , Internet-connected computers are so overwhelmed by malware attempting to communicate with their website that , unable to handle legitimate requests , they crash .`` Our review indicates that the server did not contain consumer personal information ; data was not transmitted outside the agency , and the website was not specifically targeted , '' Albright said . `` We have taken measures to further strengthen security . ''Albright said the attack would have no impact on the second open enrollment period for Obamacare , which begins on Nov. 15 .The Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services , CMS 's parent agency , and HHS leadership were notified of the attack , which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal .Representative Diane Black of Tennessee , a longtime Republican critic of Obamacare , criticized CMS for the breach , saying : `` Designing a secure website should have been a top priority for this administration . ''Republican Darrell Issa , chairman of the House of Representatives Oversight and Government Reform Committee , said the committee would seek answers from CMS Administrator Marilyn Tavenner at a hearing on Sept. 18 .A spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security , which helps investigate cyber attacks , said its Computer Emergency Readiness Team , or US-CERT , had forensically preserved the affected server and had identified and extracted the malware designed to launch a denial of service attack .US-CERT analysis indicated that only one server was involved . It was not running HealthCare.gov , but was instead used by programmers to test new code before it goes live .The test server was not supposed to be connected to the Internet , but somehow was . In addition , access to it was protected by a default password installed by the manufacturer , said Albright , who declined to say if that default was 1-2-3-4-5 or something equally breachable .Cybersecurity expert David Kennedy , chief executive of the information security firm TrustedSec LLC , said he was unconvinced this was the first successful hack on HealthCare.gov .`` There are fundamental flaws in how they 're coding the website and it 's going to take a long , long time to fix it , '' he told Reuters . `` It continues to be a really big glaring security hole .

1	"NEW YORK  Hundreds of people with HIV/AIDS in Louisiana trying to obtain coverage under President Barack Obama 's healthcare reform are in danger of being thrown out of the insurance plan they selected in a dispute over federal subsidies and the interpretation of federal rules about preventing Obamacare fraud .Some healthcare advocates see discrimination in the move , but Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana says it is not trying to keep people with HIV/AIDS from enrolling in one of its policies under the Affordable Care Act , also known as Obamacare .The state 's largest carrier is rejecting checks from a federal program designed to help these patients pay for AIDS drugs and insurance premiums , and has begun notifying customers that their enrollment in its Obamacare plans will be discontinued .The carrier says it no longer will accept third-party payments , such as those under the 1990 Ryan White Act , which many people with HIV/AIDS use to pay their premiums .`` In no event will coverage be provided to any subscribers , as of March 1 , 2014 , unless the premiums are paid by the subscriber ( or a relative ) unless otherwise required by law , '' Blue Cross Blue Shield of Louisiana spokesman John Maginnis told Reuters .AIDS FUNDS EXEMPT FROM FRAUD CONCERNSThe dispute goes back to a series of statements from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) , the lead Obamacare agency .In September , CMS informed insurers that Ryan White funds `` may be used to cover the cost of private health insurance premiums , deductibles , and co-payments '' for Obamacare plans .In November , however , it warned `` hospitals , other healthcare providers , and other commercial entities '' that it has `` significant concerns '' about their supporting premium payments and helping Obamacare consumers pay deductibles and other costs , citing the risk of fraud .The insurers told healthcare advocates that the November guidance requires them to reject payments from the Ryan White program in order to combat fraud , said Robert Greenwald , managing director of the Legal Services Center of Harvard Law School , a position Louisiana Blue still maintains .`` As an anti-fraud measure , Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana has implemented a policy , across our individual health insurance market , of not accepting premium payments from any third parties who are not related '' to the subscriber , Maginnis said .On Friday , CMS spokeswoman Tasha Bradley told Reuters that , to the contrary , Ryan White grantees `` may use funds to pay for premiums on behalf of eligible enrollees in Marketplace plans , when it is cost-effective for the Ryan White program , '' meaning that having people with HIV/AIDS enroll in insurance under Obamacare could save the government money .`` The third-party payer guidance CMS released ( in November ) does not apply to '' Ryan White programs .Maginnis did not respond to further requests , sent after business hours , for comment on CMS 's Friday statement .Hundreds of indigent HIV/AIDS patients are dependent on Ryan White payments for Obamacare because they fall into a gap . They are not eligible for Medicaid , the joint federal-state health insurance program for the poor , because Louisiana did not expand the low-income program , and Obamacare federal subsidies do n't kick in until people are at 100 percent of the federal poverty level .Before Obamacare , the 1990 Ryan White Act offered people with HIV/AIDS federal financial help in paying for AIDS drugs and health insurance premiums , especially in state-run , high-risk pools .Obamacare , which bans insurers from discriminating against people with preexisting conditions , was designed to replace these high-risk pools .Starting on October 1 , AIDS advocates and others in Louisiana `` were enrolling anyone and everyone we could '' through the Obamacare exchange , said Lucy Cordts of the New Orleans NO/AIDS Task Force .Last month , her clients and those of other AIDS groups began to hear from Louisiana Blue that their enrollments were in limbo because the company would not accept the Ryan White checks for premium payments .The only other carrier that is refusing to accept such payments is Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Dakota , according to a CMS official .North Dakota Blue `` restricts premium payment from third parties including employers , providers , and state agencies , '' said spokeswoman Andrea Dinneen , but `` is currently reviewing its eligibility policies with respect to recipients of Ryan White Program funding . '''SURE LOOKS LIKE DISCRIMINATION 'Healthcare advocates are worried that the refusal to accept Ryan White payments is an effort by insurers to keep AIDS patients from enrolling in their plans and last month began pressing the issue , including with the office of Democratic Senator Mary Landrieu .In an email reviewed by Reuters , a healthcare expert on Landrieu 's staff wrote , `` BCBS LA told me their decision was not due to the CMS guidance or any confusion ( as we thought before ) but was in fact due to adverse selection concerns . I have also recently learned North Dakota 's BCBS plan has implemented the same policy . ''Jessica Stone , the Landrieu staff member , declined to elaborate on the email further or to discuss her interactions with Louisiana Blue .Adverse selection refers to the situation where an insurer attracts patients with chronic conditions and expensive care . Louisiana Blue 's action `` sure looks to us like discrimination against sick people , '' said John Peller , vice president for policy at the AIDS Foundation of Chicago .Asked if it were engaging in efforts to avoid adverse selection by refusing to accept Ryan White payments for would-be customers with HIV/AIDS , Louisiana Blue said it was not trying to keep such customers out of its plans . `` We welcome all Louisiana residents who chose Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana , '' said Maginnis .( Reporting by Sharon Begley and Julie Steenhuysen ; Editing by Peter Henderson and Prudence Crowther )"
1	"NEW YORK  More than 6.3 million Americans were deemed eligible for government healthcare plans for the poor since the October 1 launch of President Barack Obama 's healthcare law through December , federal officials reported on Wednesday .The swelling rolls for Medicaid and the Children 's Health Insurance Program ( CHIP ) reflect both an expansion of Medicaid under Obama 's Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) and what healthcare policy analysts call an `` out-of-the-woodwork effect , '' in which people who heard about Obamacare sought to obtain health insurance and discovered that they had qualified for Medicaid even before the law expanded eligibility .`` We have people who for the first time will have some health security that they never had before , '' Kathleen Sebelius , secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services , said of the Medicaid numbers at the winter meeting of the U.S. Conference of Mayors in Washington , D.C .It was not clear how much credit goes to the healthcare law , however .`` What many people do n't read far enough to learn is that this number also can include people in some states who are eligible under pre-expansion -- the woodwork effect -- and whose Medicaid enrollment was simply renewed , '' said Matt Salo , executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors .The 6.3 million people determined eligible for Medicaid or CHIP last fall swamps the 2.2 million people who had purchased private health insurance on the state-based Obamacare marketplaces that launched on October 1 . The ACA also raised the income threshold for Medicaid eligibility to 138 percent of the federal poverty level , or $ 15,856 for a single person .A Supreme Court decision in 2012 allowed each U.S. state to decide whether to accept the expansion . So far , 25 states have reached an agreement with the administration to do so . Prior to the ACA , just over 60 million Americans were covered by Medicaid .In December alone , 2.3 million individuals were determined eligible to enroll in Medicaid or CHIP , an increase of over 20 percent from November , according to the report from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ( CMS ) , the lead Obamacare agency . About 1.2 million of these were in the 25 states ( and the District of Columbia ) already expanding Medicaid , and just over 1 million were in the 25 states that have not .The CMS figures refer to the number of people that meet Medicaid eligibility rather than actual enrollment in the program due to the troubled HealthCare.gov website , which is run by the federal government to serve Obamacare sign-ups in 36 states .For months , the website did not correctly transmit information that applicants are eligible for Medicaid to their state Medicaid program . The state offices do the actual enrollment , and have been scrambling to send out tens of thousands of letters to residents to actually enroll them , the Washington Post reported this month .At the same time , the national figures mirror what many of the Medicaid-expansion states have reported . In California , for instance , 625,000 individuals have gained coverage through private policies purchased on the state 's Obamacare exchange , Covered California , while 1.2 million enrolled in Medi-Cal , the state 's Medicaid program .The websites through which people can shop for insurance under Obamacare are required to have what the Obama administration calls a `` no wrong door '' policy , meaning that even if people went to their state 's exchange expecting to buy private insurance , the site would determine if they were instead eligible for Medicaid or CHIP , which generally charge zero premiums .Several states have gone beyond that , seeking out Medicaid-eligible people by contacting those who receive food stamps or other benefits that indicate they have very low incomes .( Reporting by Sharon Begley and David Morgan ; Editing by Amanda Kwan )"
1	"NEW YORK  Now that more than 2 million people have signed up for private insurance plans created by President Barack Obama 's healthcare law , a crucial next check-up for the new marketplace will be to see how old customers are .Early data from a handful of state exchanges shows the administration needs more young adults to sign up in the next three months to help offset costs from older enrollees and prevent insurers from raising their rates .Critics of Obama 's Affordable Care Act say the market wo n't attract enough young people to keep it financially viable , putting more pressure on government funds to compensate for any insurer losses .Data from seven states and the District of Columbia , which are running their own marketplaces , show that of more than 200,000 enrollees , nearly 22 percent are 18 to 34 years old , according to a Reuters analysis .The administration had hoped that over 38 percent , or 2.7 million , of all enrollees in 2014 would be 18 to 35 years old , based on a Congressional Budget Office estimate that 7 million people would sign up by the end of March .`` The whole insurance relationship is counting on them signing up , '' said Dale Yamamoto , an independent healthcare actuarial consultant . `` Otherwise rates will have to increase . ''The picture from the initial state data is likely to change , since it mostly includes people who enrolled only through November , before a year-end surge of sign-ups for people wanting coverage effective Jan 1 . Many experts speculate the early enrollees were more likely to be in urgent need of coverage , and therefore more likely to be older or sicker .A recent survey by The Commonwealth Fund , a healthcare research foundation , found that 41 percent of those who had shopped at the various state marketplaces by the end of December were ages 19 to 34 , up from 32 percent from an October survey .One marketplace with current data , the District of Columbia , said on Friday that of the 3,646 enrollees in private plans through Thursday , about 44 percent are young adults .Healthcare experts say many young healthy people may sign up only at the end of enrollment on March 31 to avoid paying the law 's penalty for not having health insurance .A FACTOR OF PRICEThe Affordable Care Act , popularly known as Obamacare , prevents insurers from charging people more if they have a health problem . Age is one of the few factors that can affect the price , with insurers allowed to charge up to three times more for a 64-year-old than someone in their early 20s .But the healthcare costs for a 64-year-old on average are nearly five times as much as a 21-year-old , according to a study of claims from three large insurers Yamamoto conducted for the Society of Actuaries .`` The more that the marketplace is able to attract a broad mix of enrollees including the young and healthy ... the more that costs will be sustainable and premiums will be more affordable , '' said Robert Zirkelbach , spokesman for America 's Health Insurance plans , a trade group for insurers .Other factors may be as crucial , if not more , in determining the stability of the new market , including the health status of enrollees , regardless of their age , and how that lines up with what individual insurers had projected . But those details will only become clearer later in the year based on the medical claims filed by the newly insured , making age the best early proxy about whether the market is sustainable .The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , which oversees the marketplace for 36 states , has yet to provide any demographic data about enrollees . CMS is expected to release an enrollment report later this month .Data may come sooner from insurers as they discuss their recent financial performance with investors in the next few weeks . Humana Inc said on Thursday that the mix of enrollment in its marketplace plans were likely to be `` more adverse than previously expected .But healthcare experts say insurers need a better mix of enrollees than seen in the early data .`` If a quarter or more of the enrollees are young adults , I would think that 's an encouraging sign , particularly for the first half of the open enrollment period , '' said Larry Levitt , senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation healthcare think-tank .By the end of March , `` if it 's lower than that , I think there would be some cause for concern , '' Levitt said .Levitt and colleagues at Kaiser analyzed a scenario that they deemed `` worst case '' in which young adults represented 25 percent of enrollees . They found that costs then would be about 2.4 percent higher , but insurers would retain a very slim profit margin . As a result , the Kaiser authors projected the companies would raise premiums by a commensurate amount , but not enough to destabilize the market .Using the same data as Kaiser but different assumptions , Seth Chandler , a law professor at the University of Houston who specializes in insurance , said costs would be 3.5 percent higher , should only 25 percent of enrollees be young adults .`` If we see fewer than 30 percent of the enrollees being in that 18-to-34 age bracket , that 's a warning sign that there are problems , '' Chandler said . `` If the demographics come in poorly , insurers are going to lose money . ''Chandler is a skeptic of the healthcare law and writes a blog called `` ACA Death Spiral . '' Such a spiral is thought to occur if insurers facing higher costs raise premiums , so only very sick people buy coverage , leading to even higher premiums with the pattern continuing until the insurance market either disappears or shrinks to the point that it is not sustainable .The penalty for not buying insurance increases significantly by 2016 , which should bring in more young and healthy holdouts over time .Not everyone , however , is significantly concerned about the age of Obamacare enrollees this year .Linda Blumberg , senior fellow at the Urban Institute 's Health Policy Center , said that Obamacare 's protections for insurers in the first few years means the program has time to get the demographics sorted out .`` That all combines to make me much less worried about the mix for this year , '' Blumberg said . `` I do n't think we have to get a certain percentage of enrollees to be below age 35 or this thing crumbles .

1	"NEW YORK  Some top U.S. health insurers are giving consumers more time to pay their Obamacare premiums , extending the deadline to the end of January for benefits that begin retroactively from January 1 .The new extension adds to a series of deadline delays by government and the insurance industry to compensate for technical failures and errors plaguing the enrollment process under President Barack Obama 's healthcare law .The Obama administration and insurers have been working to prevent cases where problems in setting up new policies meant a consumer who thought they had insurance would not have benefits when they needed them . Republican opponents of the law have seized on its troubled rollout as a top issue for 2014 congressional elections .Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas , Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois and three more BCBS plans that are part of the privately held Health Care Service Corp chain have moved the first payment deadline to January 30 from January 10 . All of the plans are sold through the federal website HealthCare.gov , which had a December 24 deadline for customers to enroll and be guaranteed coverage by January 1 in 36 states .Others , including Aetna Inc , said they were still considering this Friday to be the payment deadline .Technical problems prevented consumer access to HealthCare.gov in the first two months following its launch on October 1 . An emergency effort to fix the site allowed hundreds of thousands of people to use it daily by early December , and the Obama administration urged insurers to give consumers leeway to sort through any remaining errors . America 's Health Insurance Plans , a top industry trade and lobbying group , recommended a first payment deadline of January 10 .By late December , more than 2 million people nationwide had picked new private insurance plans under Obamacare , but the number included consumers who have yet to pay their first premium and therefore are not truly enrolled .Insurers say they have been communicating to customers through social media , targeted emails and telephone calls to let them know they need to pay .`` We have been receiving a significant volume of payments and continue to assist members in activating their coverage . But some signed up close to the deadline , so we are extending the payment deadline to give customers extra time to pay their first month 's premium , '' Lauren Perlstein Plungas , a spokeswoman for Health Care Service Corp , said in a statement .Independence Blue Cross Blue Shield , based in Philadelphia , is also moving its time frame to pay , until January 28 , a spokeswoman said . Independence is selling its plans for Pennsylvania on HealthCare.gov .WellPoint Inc , which operates Blue Cross Blue Shield in 14 states and is known for its Anthem and Empire brands , said that its first payment deadline is now January 15 . WellPoint is selling plans on HealthCare.gov and on some of the 14 exchanges run by states . It had previously set a January 10 deadline .The state-run Covered California exchange announced this past weekend that it was moving the payment date for insurance plans to January 15 from a previous deadline of January 6 , saying that its extension was aimed at easing the rush by consumers to pay their invoices .In Connecticut , the three insurers selling Obamacare plans have established three different deadlines for January 1 coverage : January 10 , 15 and 17 , the head of the state 's Access Health exchange Kevin Counihan said on Wednesday . In addition , the deadline for February 1 coverage is also January 15 .`` This is all just part of everyone 's scrambling to meet some of the administrative complexities of implementation and enrollment , '' Counihan said . `` Part of the challenge is that there are so many dates out there that consumers have the risk of being confused .

1	"NEW YORK  Thanks to a final April surge , California 's Obamacare marketplace enrolled a total of 1.4 million people in private health insurance plans , state officials announced on Thursday , beating a federal forecast by just over 800,000 enrollees .The marketplace also signed up an additional 1.9 million in the state 's Medicaid program for the poor .California 's Obamacare enrollments are among 7.5 million people nationally who have signed up , according to federal officials .Peter V. Lee , executive director of Covered California , the state 's Obamacare health insurance marketplace , called that `` a huge number '' and said enrollees `` are part of history . ''The country 's first open enrollment period for coverage under President Barack Obama 's healthcare reform law ended in most states on March 31 . California and a handful of others kept their doors open longer , citing technical difficulties that kept some customers from accessing Obamacare websites . The extension paid off : on the final day , April 15 , Covered California had more than 50,000 sign-ups , a one-day record .That may have come in part because Tuesday was also the deadline for filing 2013 income tax returns . This year many tax preparers , both in-person and electronic , reminded people that the law requires them to have health insurance this year or pay a tax penalty next year .Two insurance companies dominated California 's Obamacare market . Anthem Blue Cross , part of Wellpoint , got 30 percent of the total by the end of March ( the most recent data on carriers ) , and non-profit Blue Shield took 27 percent . Health Net got 19 percent and Kaiser Permanente , 17 percent , with dozens of other carriers splitting the rest .From April 1 to 15 , 205,685 Californians enrolled in private health insurance through the Covered California exchange . . The state improved significantly on its early enrollment of Latinos , a key demographic group for Democrats who hope to turn Obamacare 's successes into votes in November 's mid-term elections . Latino enrollment reached 305,106 , 28 percent of the total , 30 percent above where it stood at the end of March .Young adults 18 to 34 years old , whose participation is considered key to keeping a check on premiums , make up 29 percent of Covered California enrollment . They are 25 percent of the state 's population .People 45 to 64 , whose medical costs are expected to be relatively high , make up 48 percent of California 's enrollees .Of those enrolled in Covered California plans , 88 percent are eligible for financial subsidies to defray the cost of monthly premiums .Insurance companies report that 85 percent of enrollees have paid their first month 's premium , Lee said on Thursday . Although critics of Obamacare have pointed to the 15 percent or more who do not pay as evidence of the law 's failures , Lee told the Reuters healthcare summit this month that many non-payments are because would-be customers gain health coverage through their jobs and no longer need their Covered California plan .( Reporting by Sharon Begley ; editing by Andrew Hay )"
1	"NEW YORK  The late-December surge that pushed enrollment in private health insurance plans under Obamacare past 2.1 million people continued into 2014 , officials of several state-run insurance marketplaces said on Wednesday .It was encouraging news for White House hopes of signing up 7 million Americans by March 31 , the deadline for 2014 coverage under President Barack Obama 's healthcare law .That goal has appeared elusive due to the disastrous performance of HealthCare.gov , the federal enrollment portal through which Americans in 36 states sign up to buy health insurance , in October and November , even as the websites of many of the 15 state-run exchanges fared better .The Washington Health Benefit Exchange has had about 8,000 enrollments in private health plans since late December , bringing the total to just over 73,000 . `` We doubled our call-center staff in December '' to handle the end-of-year surge , said Richard K. Onizuka , chief executive of the exchange , in a conference call arranged by the nonprofit healthcare advocacy group Families USA . `` And now we 're almost doubling it again . ''The deadline is Wednesday for coverage that starts on February 1 . For coverage that begins on March 1 , consumers must enroll by February 15 . Those who do not have insurance must enroll by March 31 or incur a tax penalty .Kentucky , whose Democratic Gov . Steve Beshear has been an enthusiastic supporter of Obama 's Affordable Care Act , has been logging about 2,000 simultaneous users on its website in January , said Carrie Banahan , executive director of the Kentucky Health Benefit Exchange . That compares with 600 before the December surge , when `` Kynect '' topped 33,000 enrollments in private health insurance . Banahan did not release January enrollment figures .Connecticut enrolled about 36,000 people in private health plans through late December , spokeswoman Kathleen Tallarita said . Since then it has enrolled `` in some cases , 500 to 1,000 in a week , '' which would put it behind 2013 's pace . The state will release January enrollment figures on Thursday .New York also `` is seeing an increase in call volume as we approach today 's deadline , '' said Danielle Hollihan , deputy director of New York State of Health , referring to the January 15 cut-off for coverage beginning February 1 . New York has been enrolling about 7,000 people per day in private plans and Medicaid in January , she said , compared with a total of about 230,000 from October 1 through late December .California , whose 500,000 private-plan enrollments through December lead all states , has not released January numbers , but said it continued `` to see a tremendous amount of interest . ''Data on sign-up activity for HealthCare.gov in the last two weeks was not available .Virtually every state is trying to pump up enrollment by young adults , since those aged 18 to 34 so far account for only 24 percent of enrollees nationwide , the Obama administration announced on Monday .The program needs a higher proportion of younger members , who tend to be healthier and , therefore , less likely to need the costliest medical care , to offset expenses for sicker beneficiaries .On Thursday , Covered California will hold a six-hour extravaganza at YouTube studios in Los Angeles , with a live broadcast of what it calls `` a range of viral entertainment geared toward millennials about the importance of getting covered .

1	"NEW YORK  The morning after President Barack Obama announced his sweeping action to overhaul the U.S. immigration system , conservative groups and states were already pulling together legal strategies to dismantle the plan .Opponents said there will likely be a three-pronged legal approach to stymie Obama 's moves : Congress could sue the president for constitutional overreach , states could file lawsuits arguing the action strains local finances , or individuals could try to prove they 've been harmed by the order . Just hours after the speech , an Arizona sheriff filed suit arguing the reform is unconstitutional .`` There is going to be massive litigation all over the place because there is tremendous legal confusion about what the administration is doing and what the states ' obligations will be , '' said Dan Stein from the Federation for American Immigration Reform ( FAIR ) , which calls for restrictions on immigration .While law scholars say the president is on strong legal footing , a flurry of lawsuits will cause headaches for the Obama administration in its final two years and may stir public opinion against a policy meant to be one of his signature triumphs .Obama 's health care plan , another major political victory for the President , has also been mired in legal challenges with opponents taking suits all the way to the Supreme Court . Just on Friday , Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives filed a long-anticipated lawsuit challenging Obamacare .States are already lining up to sue over Obama 's immigration action , under which he plans to grant temporary legal status to some 4.4 million undocumented immigrants who are parents of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents .Republican governors Scott Walker of Wisconsin , Rick Perry of Texas and Pat McCrory of North Carolina have all voiced support for taking legal action without giving further details . Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt also announced his intention to sue .MODEL LAWSUITStill , making a legal case will be an uphill battle . Presidents historically have had wide discretion to actalone on immigration and under a concept known as `` prosecutorial discretion , '' can decide to not enforce every violation of federal law when resources are limited .In a 33-page legal memo , the Department of Justice said the action falls within the bounds of the constitution and that Congress has supported favorable treatment of law-abiding immigrants with deep U.S. ties .The main hurdle for any lawsuit will be proving `` standing , '' a requirement under U.S. law that for someone to be able to sue , they have to show they have been directly harmed .The hardest case to win would be one filed by Congress , legal experts say , since lawmakers would struggle to prove standing . Republicans have vowed to act in other ways and could try to pass laws to take away the President 's authority to act on immigration or slash funds for his initiatives .States might have a stronger argument if they can prove financial harm from the program .One ongoing case challenging Obama 's previous executive action in 2012 to grant deportation relief to immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children , could serve as a model .The suit was filed by a group of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers upset by White House directives . The state of Mississippi attempted to join the action .To prove standing , Mississippi argued illegal immigrantsdrained state resources and the ICE agents said they were being forced to violate their oaths to enforce the law .Even though a federal judge dismissed the case , he found the ICE agents had standing . Mississippi was dropped from the case but only because its economic analysis showing harm was outdated . The agents are appealing .Conservative groups also said U.S. workers might be able tobring a case if they can prove they were displaced by immigrants granted new work permits .`` We will be looking for people who can demonstratively prove that aliens who are getting work documents are working in similar fields , '' Stein from FAIR said .The suit filed Thursday by Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio - whose police force has been sued for racial profiling of immigrants - is short on legal reasoning and is likely to be dismissed , said Kari Hong a Boston College Law School professor .`` At this point it 's all rhetoric . It 's not based in strong legal analysis , '' Hong said .Short of legal action , states could move to withholdbenefits to recipients of the new status . But immigration advocates are likely to counter those moves with their own suits , potentially clogging the courts with more cases related to Obama 's order .After the deportation relief was announced in 2012 , Arizona , Nebraska and Michigan all blocked young recipients from obtaining drivers licenses . Immigrants sued in all three states .( Additional reporting by Lawrence Hurley in Washington and Gabriel Denedetti in Boca Raton ; Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi and Martin Howell )"
1	"NEW YORK  The only three insurance companies in Louisiana that sell healthcare policies under President Barack Obama 's healthcare law throughout the state are rejecting payments from a federal program intended to help low-income HIV patients , advocacy groups said on Thursday .The Louisiana Health Cooperative and Vantage Health Plan , two smaller insurers , made the move following a decision by the state 's largest insurer , Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana , late last year to reject the payments .Lambda Legal , a non-profit group , filed a civil rights complaint about the two smaller carriers ' action with the Obama administration on Thursday , following a similar complaint about Louisiana Blue last week .`` Additional carriers are jumping on the discrimination bandwagon , '' said Susan Sommer , director of constitutional litigation for Lambda Legal , which works to protect the civil rights of lesbians , gay men , and people with HIV . `` The worst nightmare for people with HIV-AIDS is coming true in Louisiana : they 're being turned away in what 's become a race to the bottom by insurers . ''The issue involves the federal Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program which , for 23 years , has made grants to states , cities and nonprofit organizations to help low-income people with HIV purchase health insurance .The organizations assumed the federal money could be used to pay premiums for Ryan White beneficiaries who purchased private coverage on insurance exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) , just as the funds had been used to pay premiums previously .In recent weeks , however , Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana began rejecting Ryan White payments sent on behalf of impoverished HIV-AIDS patients who had enrolled in one of its Obamacare plans , as did Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Dakota .The insurers told healthcare advocates that guidance issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , the lead Obamacare agency , prevented them from accepting third-party payments for the new health plans , even when the funds came from a government program .That guidance , issued in November , was meant to prevent self-dealing or even fraud . `` The worry was that a hospital , for instance , would sign up and pay ( Obamacare ) premiums for their uninsured patients , '' said law professor Mark Hall of Wake Forest University . If a hospital also steered patients toward an insurer that includes it in its network , the hospital would turn a charity patient into a paying one , something CMS regards as a form of prohibited self-dealing .Last week , CMS said the ban on third-party payments `` does not apply '' to those made on behalf of Obamacare enrollees by `` state and federal government programs or grantees ( such as the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program ) . ''Over the weekend , CMS went further , said it `` is considering amending the rules to require , '' and not merely allow , `` issuers to accept these ( Ryan White ) payments . ''On Thursday , Louisiana Blue nevertheless said it will stop honoring Ryan White and other third-party payments for premiums beginning March 1 . The policy , it said , is `` a safeguard against ... patient steering and other fraudulent activity , '' adding that it knows `` from experience that there are people who want to game the system . ''ADVERSE SELECTIONLouisiana Health Cooperative has said it `` will not be accepting third-party insurance premium payments either , '' said Lucy Cordts of the NO/AIDS Task Force . Her group , which advocates on behalf of people with AIDS , has an estimated 350 Louisiana residents who chose Coop plans . `` They 'll all now need to consider another company . ''Other healthcare advocates said they had informed Louisiana Health Cooperative officials that CMS allows Ryan White payments to be used for Obamacare insurance premiums , and were told that `` they would not change their policy unless required , '' said Moriba Karamoko , director of the Louisiana Healthcare Coalition .Coop spokeswoman Anisha Williams declined to comment .The third carrier selling Obamacare insurance throughout Louisiana , Vantage Health Plan , informed the state that it , too , will not accept Ryan White payments . A spokesperson for the physician-founded company did not return messages seeking comment .Insurance experts point out that once one carrier in a market institutes policies that drive away potentially high-cost customers such as people with HIV-AIDS , other carriers feel pressure to do the same for fear of being the only one to cover them , a situation called adverse selection .Last week , Lambda Legal filed an administrative complaint with the Office of Civil Rights of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services , CMS 's parent agency , against Louisiana Blue . On Thursday it filed complaints against Vantage and Louisiana Health Cooperative , arguing that their refusal to accept Ryan White payments flouted a key provision of the ACA , namely its requirement that insurers accept any customer regardless of health status .`` What we 're seeing in Louisiana is a crisis for low-income people with AIDS , '' said Lambda Legal 's Sommer . `` These are exactly the people the Affordable Care Act was designed to provide a safety net for . ''One patient who enrolled in a Louisiana Blue plan learned in December that the insurer would not accept Ryan White checks for his premiums .`` So now I am without insurance , '' said Mark , 44 , a former high-school teacher who is unemployed and asked that his last name not be published . He was able to obtain HIV medications from the NO/AIDS Task Force , through the Ryan White program .

1	"NEW YORK  The percentage of Americans without health insurance dipped to its lowest in nearly six years due in part to U.S. President Barack Obama 's healthcare reform law , commonly known as Obamacare , according to a Gallup poll released on Monday .Some 15.6 percent of Americans lacked health insurance in the first three months of 2014 , down from a high of 18 percent in late 2013 , according to the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index survey .`` 'Obamacare ' appears to be accomplishing its goal of increasing the percentage of Americans with health insurance coverage , '' the report said .Black and low-income Americans saw some of the most pronounced drops in the uninsured rate , with declines of more than 3 percentage points .Hispanics remained the group most likely not to be insured , with more than one in three individuals lacking coverage , though the level dropped nearly 2 points in the first quarter , according to the poll of 43,500 adult Americans between January and March . It has a margin of error of 1 percentage point .The percentage of Americans without health insurance has generally trended upward over the past six years . Gallup began tracking insurance coverage in 2008 , starting at a low of 14.5 percent and increasing every subsequent year except for 2012 .Obamacare 's individual mandate , which requires most Americans to obtain coverage or face a fine , went into effect in January and the law 's first enrollment period ended March 31 . The government granted a deadline extension into April for those who faced technical difficulties while signing up .The White House last week reported a total of 7.1 million private insurance enrollments through the Affordable Care Act 's health insurance exchanges , exceeding most expectations , despite a troubled rollout in October 2013 .An additional 3 million signed up for Medicaid , government-provided health insurance for low-income people , the administration said Friday , bringing the total number of sign-ups to over 10 million .Republicans have consistently campaigned against the law , making at least 50 attempts to repeal it since it was signed in 2010 . Opposition to Obamacare also figures prominently in many 2014 midterm Congressional campaigns .The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has not yet released its April enrollment report , Gallup researchers said , but the survey 's findings matched the government 's last figures .( Editing by Scott Malone and Bernadette Baum )"
1	"NEW YORK  Three Louisiana insurers agreed on Monday to continue to accept payments from a federal program for low-income people with HIV/AIDS to cover their Obamacare insurance premiums , the carriers said during a hearing in U.S. District Court .Earlier this year BlueCross BlueShield of Louisiana , the state 's largest carrier , said it would begin rejecting checks from a federal program called the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program that for decades had helped low-income people with HIV and AIDS pay for both AIDS drugs and insurance premiums .Louisiana Health Cooperative and Vantage Health Plan , the two other insurers selling Obamacare policies throughout the state , said they would be forced to follow the same strategy .Louisiana Blue said its policy against third-party payments was designed to prevent fraud . The chief federal agency administering President Barack Obama 's Affordable Care Act , however , said it strongly encouraged carriers to accept the Ryan White payments and did not see any potential for fraud .That led critics to charge the insurer with adopting a policy designed to keep high-medical-cost HIV/AIDS patients off its rolls , something Louisiana Blue denied .In response to the company 's decision not to accept Ryan White payments for Obamacare premiums after this month , Lambda Legal , a civil rights group that works on behalf of gay men and lesbians , filed a lawsuit against it , asking that Louisiana Blue be forced to accept the payments .At a hearing on Monday , the company said it would accept the Ryan White payments for premiums on behalf of lower-income Louisianans living with HIV through November 15 , 2014 , when the next open enrollment period begins .`` This will maintain critical health care coverage '' for such customers , '' Scott Schoettes of Lambda Legal said in a statement . `` There was a Sword of Damocles hanging over our client and other Louisianans , with these insurers having previously indicated that in just three weeks they would stop accepting the federal Ryan White Program insurance premium subsidies . ''Although the three Louisiana insurers got national attention for their refusal to accept Ryan White payments for new HIV/AIDS customers who signed up for coverage via HealthCare.gov , the federal Obamacare portal , in fact Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Dakota has the same policy , said spokeswoman Andrea Dinneen .`` We have never accepted third-party payments for ACA products or any of our products , '' she told Reuters . `` Because we 've always had this policy , we did not accept payments from RWHAP pre-ACA '' either .The Louisiana case is East v.

1	"NEW YORK  U.S. judges have their work cut out for them untangling a legal knot created on Tuesday when two federal appeals courts released conflicting rulings hours apart going to the heart of the role the federal government will play in Obamacare .The latest conservative challenge to President Barack Obama 's healthcare overhaul will not necessarily land in the U.S. Supreme Court , although it could end up there as soon as this year if the two lower courts go on disagreeing .At stake is how millions of Americans pay for private health insurance , or if they can afford it at all .The 2010 Affordable Care Act authorized tax credits to subsidize private health insurance . Seeking to upend the law as it was going into effect , businesses and individuals filed lawsuits asking that the subsidies be declared unlawful except in states that established their own online insurance marketplaces .Analysts estimate that as many as five million people could be affected if subsidies disappear from the federally created marketplaces . The federal government set up insurance marketplaces in 36 states that did not themselves establish exchanges .Tuesday 's conflicting rulings created what lawyers call a circuit split .A three-judge panel in Washington , D.C. , voted 2-1 to invalidate subsidies in the 36 states . Hours later , a three-judge panel in Richmond , Virginia , unanimously ruled the opposite , upholding the subsidies nationwide .The courts divided on the meaning behind the law 's words . The law says subsidies may be given `` through an exchange established by the state , '' a phrase that conservative lawyers argue excludes the federal marketplace . The Obama administration counters that the exchanges were meant to be uniform .Both cases had been pending for months , and both courts are on an equal level in the U.S. judicial system , just below the Supreme Court .Their divide might not last , though . Some lawyers following the litigation said they expected the full U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to vote to rehear the case and reverse its panel .DEMOCRATIC APPOINTEESSince taking office in 2009 , Obama has used his appointment power to reshape the D.C . Circuit and the Richmond-based 4th Circuit . Judges appointed by Democratic presidents were a minority on both courts , but they now have majorities .`` If the D.C . Circuit does away with the panel ruling that we saw from that court this morning , then every court will have ruled in favor of the government , '' Elizabeth Wydra , chief counsel of the Constitutional Accountability Center , a liberal legal group , told reporters on a conference call .The suits were brought by a mix of individuals and businesses from Texas , Kansas , Missouri , Tennessee , West Virginia and Virginia .In the Richmond case , the plaintiffs could ask for a rehearing before the full 4th Circuit , despite its Democratic-appointee majority , or they could petition directly to the Supreme Court .The latter option would put the question quickly before the closely divided high court , where in 2012 conservative Chief Justice John Roberts joined the four most liberal justices to turn aside a challenge to Obamacare . The court has no obligation to hear the case .`` We just have n't made a decision yet on what we will be doing , '' said Sam Kazman , general counsel for the Competitive Enterprise Institute , a conservative group that helped to organize the suits .Two lawsuits challenging the tax credits are pending in federal courts in Indiana and Oklahoma . They are at an earlier stage than the ones in Virginia and Washington , D.C .Nicholas Bagley , a University of Michigan law professor , said that it was difficult to predict what judges would do but that a reversal of Tuesday 's D.C . Circuit ruling appeared likely .After that , `` it 's just too early to know what the Supreme Court in that context would choose to do , '' Bagley said on a conference call organized by the Federalist Society , a conservative legal group .( Additional reporting by Aruna Viswanatha ; Editing by Howard Goller )"
1	"NEW YORK  U.S. medical providers are seeing only a trickle of patients newly insured under President Barack Obama 's healthcare law , as insurers , hospitals and doctors try to work out any hitches in coverage .More than 2 million people have signed up for new private health plans that took effect on Wednesday under the Affordable Care Act , popularly known as Obamacare . While some of those consumers were already lining up doctor visits last month , early reports from providers and an online medical booking service show the demand for care has been modest so far .Within the Obama administration , officials fear a surge of patients in the coming weeks could spotlight cases where consumers who signed up for insurance ca n't immediately get care due to technical failures on the government 's HealthCare.gov enrollment website .Already on Friday , Senate Republicans opposed to the law seized on scattered media reports of a handful of people having difficulty confirming their new insurance policies , feeding into a narrative of Obamacare 's harms that is expected to intensify ahead of Congressional elections in November .Central Ohio Primary Care , a 250-physician practice , is holding off on filing claims for patients who say they bought plans through the HealthCare.gov exchange , said Chief Executive Officer Dr. William Wulf .The delay will allow insurers more time to confirm membership information and avert any erroneous claim denials , Wulf said .Such a grace period `` surely is not desirable long term , '' he said , but the number of patients with Obamacare plans has so far been low and represents only a small fraction of the practice 's patients .`` What we 're doing is we 're seeing the patients , trusting they are in fact going to pay for insurance and just not sending a bill yet , '' Wulf said .Contrary to fears that Obamacare enrollees would be sicker than other Americans , with serious and expensive pent-up medical needs , so far they are not much different from other Americans , according to data from ZocDoc , a six-year-old closely held company that allows patients to find a doctor who accepts their insurance and make an appointment online .Obamacare consumers `` started booking appointments the last two weeks of December for January appointments , '' said ZocDoc founder and Chief Operating Officer Dr. Oliver Kharraz . `` The vast majority of these were for preventive care , not acute care where people indicated they had an existing illness , which accounted for only 7 percent of searches . ''That mirrors the behavior of ZocDoc 's previously insured users . ZocDoc says the site gets just over 5 million unique visitors each month who are searching doctors ' ratings and reviews as well as making appointments .As many as 7 million people are expected to sign up for the new health plans , which include government subsidies for lower-income households , by the time 2014 enrollment ends on March 31 .PENT-UP DEMANDOf course , some newly insured people were anxious to get care almost as soon as the last strains of Auld Lang Syne petered out .One customer of North Shore-LIJ CareConnect , a new insurer selling plans on the New York State of Health marketplace , went to its customer center last month , paid cash for a policy , `` and asked if he could now schedule his son 's gastric bypass , '' said Chief Executive Officer Alan Murray .In the case of another CareConnect customer , last month her doctor arranged for her to have surgery for recently diagnosed endometrial cancer as soon as possible . The insurer approved it in December , before her coverage even kicked in , the surgery was successfully performed on January 2 , and the woman was discharged from the hospital on Friday .Insurers also heard from unusually high numbers of new customers anxious to confirm their coverage .On January 1 , Philadelphia-based Independence Blue Cross received eight times as many calls as a typical New Year 's Day from consumers most commonly seeking to confirm that they were indeed covered , said Brian Lobley , senior vice president of marketing and consumer business .`` We have n't seen any systemic issues '' of Independence 's newest members having trouble confirming their policies , he said .Because medical practices often do not file insurance claims daily , he added , it is too early to draw any conclusions about use of medical services with the new plans .On ZocDoc , people with Obamacare insurance searched most frequently for primary care physicians , accounting for more than half of all searches , said Kharraz , followed by obstetricians/gynecologists and dermatologists . That is identical to the most-searched-for categories for people with non-Obamacare coverage , he said .Hospitals expect Obamacare to bring them more paying patients and reduce the amount of uncompensated care they provide , but have not seen a surge yet .`` We continue to expect an uptick in volume , but we do n't think it 's anything beyond what most hospitals are prepared to handle , '' said Jeff Goldman , vice president of coverage policy for the American Hospital AssociationPharmacists are not reporting a surge in demand either . `` At this time , activity is fairly typical of what we experience each year when insurance changes take effect , '' said Walgreen Co spokeswoman Markeisha Marshall . `` Nonetheless , we anticipate a surge of activity next week .

1	"Nearly a week has gone by since the Supreme Courts unexpected decision to enlist in the latest effort to destroy the Affordable Care Act , and the shock remains unabated . This is Bush v. Gore all over again ,  one friend said as we struggled to absorb the news last Friday afternoon . No ,  I replied . Its worse.What I meant was this : In the inconclusive aftermath of the 2000 presidential election , a growing sense of urgency , even crisis , gave rise to a plausible argument that someone had better do something soon to find out who would be the next president . True , a federal statute on the books defined the someone as Congress , but the Bush forces got to the Supreme Court first with a case that fell within the courts jurisdiction . The 5-to-4 decision to stop the Florida recount had the effect of calling the election for the governor of Texas , George W. Bush . I disagreed with the decision and considered the contorted way the majority deployed the Constitutions equal-protection guarantee to be ludicrous . But in the years since , Ive often felt like the last progressive willing to defend the court for getting involved when it did .Thats not the case here . There was no urgency . There was no crisis of governance , not even a potential one . There is , rather , a politically manufactured argument over how to interpret several sections of the Affordable Care Act that admittedly fit awkwardly together in defining how the tax credits are supposed to work for people who buy their health insurance on the exchanges set up under the law .Further , the case the court agreed to decide , King v. Burwell , doesnt fit the normal criterion for Supreme Court review . There is no conflict among the federal appellate circuits . ( Remember that just a month ago , the absence of a circuit conflict led the justices to decline to hear seven same-sex marriage cases ? ) In the King case , a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit , in Richmond , Va. , unanimously upheld the governments position that the tax subsidy is available to those who buy insurance on the federally run exchanges that are now in operation in 36 states .A panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled 2-to-1 the other way , accepting the plaintiffs argument that the language of the statute limits the tax subsidies to those who buy insurance through the state exchanges , which only 14 states have chosen to set up . The full appeals court quickly vacated the panels judgment and agreed to rehear the case . The new argument was set for next month , and the briefs were already filed . The absence of a circuit conflict and an imminent rehearing by the countrys most important court of appeals would , in the past , have led the Supreme Court to refrain from getting involved .So no , this isnt Bush v. Gore . This is a naked power grab by conservative justices who two years ago just missed killing the Affordable Care Act in its cradle , before it fully took effect . When the court agreed to hear the first case , there actually was a conflict in the circuits on the constitutionality of the individual insurance mandate . So the Supreme Courts grant of review was not only unexceptional but necessary : a neutral act . The popular belief then that the courts intervention indicated hostility to the law was , at the least , premature .Not so this time . There is simply no way to describe what the court did last Friday as a neutral act . Now that the justices have blown their own cover , I notice the hint of a slightly defensive tone creeping into the commentary of some of those who have been cheering the prospect of rendering the Affordable Care Act unworkable : that as a statutory case , without major constitutional implications , any problems for ordinary Americans that result from a ruling against the government can be fixed by Congress ( where House Republicans have voted 50 times to repeal the entire law ) or by the states themselves ( 36 of which failed to set up their own exchanges , thus requiring the federal government to step in as provided by the law ) .Sure .It bears repeating that whats at stake is whether the Affordable Care Act can continue on its successful trajectory or whether it will collapse into the death spiral it was structured to avoid . The reason goes back to the individual mandate , the constitutionality of which the Supreme Court upheld by a 5-to-4 vote two years ago . The policy reason for requiring everyone to carry health insurance is to guarantee a big pool of basically healthy people and to prevent what might otherwise be the smart strategic behavior of buying insurance only when illness strikes ( behavior the laws guarantee issue provision would otherwise invite , since no one can be turned down on the basis of a pre-existing condition . )The law is also designed to make insurance affordable , with no one being required to spend more than 8 percent of his or her income of health insurance .Federal income tax subsidies available on the exchanges are supposed to bring premium costs below that threshold ; without the credits , many people would be exempt from the individual mandate and the law would fail .Congress assumed that most states would set up exchanges ; most states , led by red-state governors , did not . Section 1321 of the law provides that when a state defaults , the secretary of health and human services shall establish and operate such Exchange within the State. Clear enough : such Exchange implies , without explicitly saying so , that the federal exchange stands in for the missing states exchange and assumes its functions . But another section , 1401 , explicitly makes the tax subsidies available to taxpayers and their dependents who buy insurance through an Exchange established by the State. Those challenging the law say this means only the state and that the I.R.S . is not authorized to give subsidies to the more than five million people enrolled through federally run exchanges .These two provisions , part of a 900-page statute that was cobbled together without going through the usual House-Senate conference committee in which it might have been cleaned up , are the source of the confusion . The answer to the problem , as the Fourth Circuit panel found unanimously in the King case , is obvious . Its a basic principle of administrative law that when a federal statute is ambiguous , courts defer to the agencys interpretation  here , the I.R.S . regulation that makes the tax credits available without regard to whether the exchange is state or federal .The 1984 decision that established this deference principle , Chevron U.S.A. v. Natural Resources Defense Council , Inc. , is so central to the modern understanding of how the government works that it is among the most often invoked Supreme Court decisions of all time , cited in some 13,000 judicial decisions so far , a number that grows at the rate of about 1,000 a year . The tax provisions of the Affordable Care Act fall so naturally onto the Chevron deference landscape that it would take an agenda-driven act of judicial will to keep them out and to conclude that Congress enacted a law that contained the seeds of its own destruction .Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. knows something about taxes . He saved the Affordable Care Act from his usual allies two years ago by his opinion deeming the individual mandates penalty provision to fall within Congresss tax power . This case puts him back under what I can only assume is an unwelcome spotlight .It takes the votes of four of the nine justices to accept a case . Certainly Justices Anthony M. Kennedy , Antonin Scalia , Clarence Thomas , and Samuel A. Alito Jr.  the four who two years ago would have invalidated not only the individual mandate but the entire law  voted to hear King v. Burwell . ( Michael A. Carvin , the plaintiffs lawyer , predicted as much last month , declaring in an uninhibited interview that the pending rehearing before an appeals court that has recently attained a majority of Democratic-appointed judges would be no deterrent to the justices who wanted to take the case . I dont know that four justices , who are needed here , are going to give much of a damn about what a bunch of Obama appointees on the D.C . Circuit think ,  he told a reporter from Talking Points Memo . )An intriguing question is whether there was a fifth vote as well , from the chief justice . I have no idea , although I cant imagine why he would think that taking this case was either in the courts interest or in his own ; just two months ago , at a public appearance at the University of Nebraska , he expressed concern that the partisan rancor of Washington could spill over onto the court .Heres another possible scenario , just a theory : that the four , still steaming over what the right wing regards as the chief justices betrayal two years ago , voted to hear King v. Burwell not only for its destructive potential , but precisely to put the heat on John Roberts . I hadnt really focused on this idea until I read a piece that John Yoo posted on National Review Online the day after the court granted the case . Professor Yoo , formerly of the Justice Departments Office of Legal Counsel and now at the University of California at Berkeley , wrote that the new case gave the chief justice the chance to atone for his error in upholding Obamacare and that it will be the mission of his chief justiceship to repair the damage. John Yoo  yes , the Bush administration lawyer whose torture memos attempted to justify that administrations enhanced interrogation policies  is a smart man , a former law clerk to Justice Thomas who remains well connected at the court . His choice of the words `` atone and mission ,  with their religious resonance addressed to the devoutly Catholic chief justice , is no accident .So this case is rich in almost every possible dimension . Its arrival on the Supreme Courts docket is also profoundly depressing . In decades of court-watching , I have struggled  sometimes it has seemed against all odds  to maintain the belief that the Supreme Court really is a court and not just a collection of politicians in robes . This past week , Ive found myself struggling against the impulse to say two words : I surrender ."
1	"Nested within the news about falling deficits is news about slowing health care cost inflation , which seems to be outlasting the recession and which is driving the long-term projections for Medicare spending downward . Since one of the big questions in the Great Obamacare Debate was whether the new health care law would accelerate cost growth ( as expanded subsidies and regulations often tend to do ) or reduce it ( thanks to the various cost-containing experiments and pilot programs embedded within the bill ) , the news that costs are falling in advance of the bills implementation has some liberals crowing . Jonathan Chait , in particular , has taken to explaining why the growing mass of evidence that the health-care-cost inflation problem is indeed solvable cuts the legs out from under the entire right-of-center take on health care , deficits and entitlements , and puts the data squarely on the side of health care reforms proponents . Heres his elaboration on this theme:The Affordable Care Act  created a wide slew of reforms intended to attack health-care inflation from every possible angle . The law created bundled payments , so that Medicare would pay hospitals or groups of doctors based on quality , not quantity , of care . It penalized hospitals that have to readmit patients owing to shoddy work ( they previously would enjoy a second payday for doing so ) , taxed high-cost health-insurance plans , encouraged electronic medical records and research on effective treatments , and many other things . Nobody believed every one of these experiments would work perfectly . The idea was to try as many promising reforms as possible , and health-care wonks expressed cautious optimism that the law contained a wide breadth of them .Over the last few years , health-care inflation has indeed decelerated  far more deeply than even the most optimistic backers of the law dare hoped At first , the sharp slowdown in health-care costs was assumed to have happened because the recession is making people cut back on their medical care  But as the trend has persisted , and undergone deeper study , a consensus is emerging that this is not the case at all . Several studies have found that the recession does not account for all , and possibly not even most , of the slowdown .The trend precedes Obamacare , too . But the law cant be cleanly separated from the broad sentiment that the medical industry needed to overhaul its practices . As Matthew Yglesias argues , If forward-looking investors think that future increases in health care spending will be met with legislative efforts to curb health care spending , then investments that rely on future high levels of health care spending wont be made and the system will lack the capacity to deliver ever-growing levels of services. In keeping with Yglesiass premise , construction on hospitals cratered since 2009 and has not recovered .Even with the data on their side , none of the advocates of Obamacare is nearly as certain the law will succeed as conservatives  are that it will fail . That is a testament only to the overweening ideological certainty that pervades the right .But the mere fact that health care costs are slowing doesnt mean that the data is on liberals side , because nobody on the right argued that the health inflation problem wasnt solvable. Rather , conservatives argued that the best way to solve the problem was to change the way we provide insurance , so that ordinary health care consumption isnt so heavily subsidized , and market forces have more room to work . Hence the rights support for catastrophic coverage , health savings accounts , premium support for Medicare , etc . And the conservative fear was that by subsidizing comprehensive insurance plans and further regulating the insurance market , the new health care law would push the health care system in precisely the opposite direction  swamping , in the process , any beneficial impact from the bills various cost-control measures . The problem with Obamacare , in other words , was that while it promised to attack health-care inflation from as many angles as possible , it actually made it much harder to attack from the angle that right-of-center wonks considered most likely to work .Now does the recent drop in health care inflation vitiate this argument ? Well , not on the evidence of the studies that Chait invokes , and which my colleague Annie Lowrey recently wrote up . These studies tend to agree that the recession played a big-but-not-exclusive role in the recent slowdown in cost growth , while disagreeing on how much of this slowdown it explains ( one study says 77 percent , another 37 percent ) . They also cite the slow shift away from fee-for-service medicine that the health care law is designed to encourage ( which is a point in favor of the pro-Obamacare argument , obviously ) , the slowing pace of medical innovation ( which is good news for budgets but not for actual human beings ) , and finally  well , Ill just quote Lowrey:Among other factors , the studies found that rising out-of-pocket payments had played a major role in the decline . The proportion of workers with employer-sponsored health insurance enrolled in a plan that required a deductible climbed to about three-quarters in 2012 from about half in 2006 , the Kaiser Family Foundation has found . Moreover , those deductibles  the amount a person needs to pay before insurance steps in to cover claims  have risen sharply . That exposes workers to a larger share of their own health costs , and generally forces them to spend less .In other words , health care costs are growing more slowly than many conservatives feared they would in part because  conservatives preferred policy prescriptions are being taken up in the private sector , and having an effect ! This trend may be a case against the apocalyptic right-wing deficit panic that produced the debt ceiling debacle ; there I tend to agree with Chait . But in policy terms , it seems like it makes a better case for the Paul Ryan-Ron Wyden premium support proposal for Medicare and the potential right-0f-center alternatives to Obamacare than it does for Obamacare itself .Not a dispositive case , obviously : There are many forces at work here , and since evidence also shows positive results for some of the cost control measures that the health care law tries to promote , I understand why Chait prefers to emphasize that part of the story , and hope for even slower cost growth once Obamacare is fully operational . But there isnt anything in the data to justify his claim that the health care bill as a whole is being vindicated by recession-era trends . The question isnt whether some of the things that the law does could have a positive effect on cost inflation : They clearly could ! Its whether the as-yet-unimplemented totality of the bill  the $ 1 trillion in new spending and the thicket of new regulations as well as all the pilot programs and payment reforms  will bend the cost curve up or down . And there I think conservatives still have every reason to be skeptical ."
1	"News from New York : it looks as if insurance premiums on the individual market are going to plunge thanks to Obamacare . This shouldnt come as a surprise ; in fact , the New York experience perfectly illustrates why Obamacare had to look the way it does . And it also illustrates why conservatives should be terrified about this legislation , as it takes effect . Americans may have had a lot of misgivings in advance , thanks to vast , deliberately spread misinformation . But I agree with Matt Yglesias  unless the GOP finds even more ways to sabotage the plan , this thing is going to work , its going to be extremely popular , and its going to wreak havoc with conservative ideology .To understand whats happening in New York , you have to start with what almost everyone at least pretends to believe : Americans shouldnt find it impossible to get health insurance because of pre-existing conditions that arent their fault . Two decades ago , New York tried to deal with this by imposing community rating : insurance is available to everyone , and the price doesnt depend on your medical history .The problem was that this created a death spiral : young , healthy people didnt buy insurance , worsening the risk pool , driving up premiums , driving out more relatively healthy people , etc. , until you were left with a rump of very ill people paying very high rates .How do you deal with this ? Well , ideally , Medicare for all . But since that wasnt going to happen , you improve the risk pool by requiring everyone to buy insurance  the individual mandate . And since some people wont be able to afford that , you also offer subsidies . Voila ! ObamaRomneycare !Where does the money for the subsidies come from ? Partly by reducing corporate welfare : reducing overpayments for Medicare Advantage , reducing tax breaks for very generous insurance plans ; partly with new taxes on the wealthy .And while a few people will be hurt  young , healthy individuals too affluent to qualify for subsidies , wealthy taxpayers , etc .  a much larger number of people will be helped , some of them enormously .Does this amount to redistribution ? Well , yes  not as an end in itself , but yes , a lot of people will be made better off at the expense of an affluent few .And Yglesias is right : there will be bobbles along the way , but this is going to become an immensely popular program . By the time Liz Cheney challenges Hillary Clintons reelection campaign , there will be signs at the rallies declaring Dont let the government get its hands on Obamacare ! Conservatives are right to be hysterical about this : its an attack on everything they believe  and its going to make Americans lives better . What could be worse ?"
1	"Newt Gingrich has acknowledged that his tendency to spout off like a political analyst might get him into trouble on the campaign trail .On Monday , Mr. Gingrich , the former speaker of the House , sought to explain away just that kind of Sunday-morning pontification , in which he blasted the budget by his Republican colleagues in Congress and endorsed an individual mandate for health insurance .I am completely opposed to the Obamacare mandate on individuals ,  Mr. Gingrich said in a new video released Monday . I fought it for two and half years at the Center for Health Transformation . You can see all the things we did to stop it at HealthTransformation.net . I am for the repeal of Obamacare and I am against any effort to impose a federal mandate on anyone because it is fundamentally wrong and I believe unconstitutional.The video was a quick attempt to walk back from his comments on NBCs Meet the Press on Sunday .I agree that all of us have a responsibility to help pay for health care . And I think that there are ways to do it that make most libertarians relatively happy ,  Mr. Gingrich told the host David Gregory . Ive said consistently , where theres some requirement you either have health insurance or you post a bond or in some way you indicate youre going to be held accountable.Mr. Gingrich also said on the show that hes uncomfortable with the proposed changes to Medicare in the budget put forth by Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin , the chairman of the House budget committee .I dont think right-wing social engineering is any more desirable than left-wing social engineering ,  Mr. Gingrich said Sunday . I dont think imposing radical change from the right or the left is a very good way for a free society to operate.That brought a quick retort from Mr. Ryan on Monday morning , who asked on a conservative radio program , With allies like that , who needs the left ? Rick Tyler , a spokesman for Mr. Gingrich , sought to soften his bosss comments . In an e-mail to The Weekly Standard , Mr. Tyler wrote that there is little daylight between Ryan and Gingrich.But look how it gets reported ,  Mr. Tyler continued . Newt would fully support Ryan if it were not compulsory . We need to design a better system that people will voluntarily move to . That is a major difference in design but not substance."

1	"Now that Republicans are set to control both houses of Congress , the great question is : What will they do with it ?The message from Washington ( and Louisville , Ky. , where the incoming Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell spoke ) on Wednesday was of constructive desire to find areas for common ground . The question is what concrete legislation that might lead to , and whether it will dissolve the first time that concrete legislation makes its way to the Senate floor .As we wrote earlier , moments like this  when a president in his final two years of an eight-year run faces a sharply hostile Congress  are certainly not when big , ideologically polarizing legislation is likely to be enacted . Republicans may have a comfortable majority in both the House and Senate , after all , but not enough votes to override a presidential veto . My colleague Carl Hulse reports that Republicans are eager to show they can be a governing party and seek to move legislation that many Congressional Democrats might object to but which Mr. Obama is likely to sign .When there has meaningful lawmaking in this environment , it has tended to be on more below-the-radar issues in which the party leading Congress has greater enthusiasm . Analysts who try to handicap what will happen in Washington have been grappling with what , if anything , that might consist of in the 114th Congress , which begins in January . Heres a rundown of the possibilities .Keeping the government running .Republicans will have to decide how aggressively they will use the need to fund the government to extract policy concessions from the Obama administration . Will these be the Republicans of 2011 through 2013 , when a hard-edged approach culminated in a two-week government shutdown driven by demands that the president agree to a repeal of his signature health reform law ?Or will they be the Republicans of 2014 , who presented themselves as a responsible governing party while looking to chip away at Obamacare and other White House priorities piece-by-piece and without a grand , disruptive showdown ?One way or another , the debt ceiling will need to be raised sometime in the first part of 2015 to prevent a government default , and deals will need to be made to continue funding the federal government without the high drama of standoffs like that over the debt ceiling in 2011 , the fiscal cliff of late 2012 and the shutdown in 2013 .It will pit two sides of the G.O.P . against each other . One team of Republican leadership seeks to bolster the partys brand in the run-up to 2016 elections and is responsive to business interests who prefer stability . The other is the harder-right contingent of the caucus that wants to try to shut down Obamacare at any cost . Presidential politics may come into play as well , as potential candidates like Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky push for a harder-edged approach than that preferred by the majority leader Mitch McConnell . ( Let me be clear : There will be no shutdowns and no default on the national debt ,  Mr. McConnell said Wednesday in his appearance in Louisville ) .Sean West , who heads the United States practice of the Eurasia Group , a political risk consultancy , argues that the odds of a return to disruptive showdowns of the recent past is only about 25 percent . The Republicans have no incentives to play games ,  he said . Theyre focused on looking like a party that can govern.A trade deal on the way ?The likelihood of a major trade deal with Pacific Rim nations is , if anything , higher after the Republican victory than before . The soon-to-be-former Senate majority leader , Harry Reid , and many other Democrats have been skeptical of further American trade agreements because of union opposition and a fear of the impact of continued globalization on American wages . The Obama administration has pursued the deals , viewing them both as positive for American exporters and as part of a geopolitical strategy of creating stronger ties with Asian nations that can counter Chinese influence .So the Obama administration may have better luck with the Republican Senate than it would have with a Democrat-led chamber in obtaining passage of the Trans-Pacific Partnership , a sweeping trade agreement with 11 countries stretching from Japan to New Zealand to Chile .That said , there are many hurdles to getting a complicated deal done . They need to finesse a two-step process in which Mr. Obama first wins trade promotion authority to fast-track negotiations and then separately secures passage of a finished agreement , which has many moving parts . Early signs are that the Republican Congress could move on that authority early next year .Republicans will probably demand greater heed to businesses wishes than the organized labor and environmental concerns that are priorities for Obama . And with just over two years left in his presidency , the clock is ticking .A second trade agreement , with Europe , known as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership , is moving more slowly and will be even more challenging for Mr. Obama and congressional Republicans to enact in the coming two years .Is it time to overhaul the corporate income tax ?The tax system for American corporations is , by all accounts , a mess . It places higher tax rates on businesses than most other advanced nations , yet raises less revenue relative to the economy thanks to a byzantine set of carve-outs and special deductions . It makes possible so-called corporate inversions , in which American firms cut their tax bill by buying a smaller company overseas and relocating their headquarters . The tax code hasnt been systematically reformed since 1986 .In other words , it would seem ready made for a bipartisan compromise to cut the rate , cut the deductions , and make the system overall more fair and efficient . It is easy in theory to imagine a bill that a Republican Congress might pass that President Obama would happily sign . The political noise on inversions obscures the broad similarity of the political parties approach to tax reform ,  wrote Terry Haines , head of political analysis at ISI Evercore , in a report . If anything , the continued inversions controversy continues to provide a powerful stimulus for both parties to address the fundamental noncompetitiveness of the U.S. tax code.The challenge is not the theory , but the practical dimensions .Tax reform legislation is almost by definition a hard slog even when the parties broadly agree , pitting lobbyists for companies that win from the changes against those who would lose . Things are also complicated by Republicans desire to keep reform of the individual income tax code on the table as part of the process , with an eye toward reducing tax rates  most likely a nonstarter for Mr. Obama and other Democrats .Some less likely policies .There are other areas that superficially would seem to fit the model of a policy area where there is room for bipartisan compromise , but in which legislation appears unlikely to make it to President Obamas desk before he leaves office .First , immigration reform . Although the Senate passed a bipartisan immigration bill last year , it has been bogged down in the House as conservative members object to what they see as amnesty for illegal immigrants . While the bill , or one like it , has strong support in the business community , as a practical matter its not clear that anything has happened that would change that dynamic . If anything , Congress has become more conservative .Second , housing finance reform . Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been under government control since 2008 , leaving the government managing a vast proportion of the mortgage market .But Democrats and Republicans remain far apart on how much government support should exist for home lending in any deal , and neither side shows much interest in compromising . Throw in the fact that the status quo is working O.K. , making a lot of money for taxpayers and keeping a flow of cheap money into housing that makes the politically powerful real estate industry happy , and its not clear what would force a compromise .Given those realities , writes Brian Gardner , an analyst at Keefe , Bruyette & Woods , a financial services consultancy , we remain confident that mortgage finance legislation is unlikely to pass Congress until 2017 at the earliest.Thats what everyone wants to hear : confidence in Washington ."
1	"Now that it seems that the sheer force of Ted Cruzs ( genuinely remarkable ! ) physical stamina wont be enough to bring Obamacare to its knees , its worth stepping back and saying something about the current prospects for an actual conservative replacement for/reform of Obamacare . Two recent pieces on this subject recommend themselves : One is in the latest National Affairs , where Thomas Miller offers an extended reality check on the pressing need for and current unreadiness of Republican health care alternatives ; the other is over at Bloomberg View , where Ramesh Ponnuru presents a gentle critique of one such alternative , from the Republican Study Committee , praising some of its features while suggesting ( correctly ) that it would need to include an actual tax credit for the purchase of insurance to represent a plausible replacement for the presidents health care law .The absence of such a credit , sadly , is not a coincidence . As Ive noted before , a lot of Congressional Republicans are resistant to the more plausible conservative proposals on health care precisely because they dont want to find the money required to make any of them work  in some cases because they prefer the comforting illusion that the current system represents some sort of free market ideal that would be wrecked if we started providing tax credits to the currently-uninsured , and in other cases because theyre all-too-aware that some of that money would have to come from caps and cuts that affect groups that currently vote Republican . This has left health care as the glaring exception to the pattern of policy innovation I discussed in Sundays column : The partys populists have been willing to take interesting risks on a variety of issues , but on health care its mostly just been repeal , repeal , repeal with entirely-insufficient gestures offered as replacements .Which is why Josh Barro , professional scourge of G.O.P . unseriousness , feels comfortable dismissing Millers argument ( and by implication , Ponnurus ) as follows:Though Miller spends 6,000 words laying out his health policy vision , he never explicitly notes two facts about his approach : It would cost a lot of taxpayer money to implement , and it wouldnt achieve universal health coverage . The former makes the approach a nonstarter for so many conservatives that no Republican Congress would ever implement it . The latter makes it unsaleable to the broader electorate .On the second point , I think hes mistaken , or at least oversimplifying ( not least because Obamacare itself doesnt achieve universal health coverage ) , but Ill just direct you to Reihan Salams comments on the universality issue and focus on Barros first claim : That no Republican Congress would ever implement the ideas that conservative policy wonks have proposed .For this Republican Congress hes most likely right , the efforts of a few lawmakers notwithstanding , for the reasons sketched above . For the next one or especially the one after that , though , I think the calculus could very easily change . Thats because right now , with the new health care law as-yet-unimplemented , were still in a world where the G.O.P.s politicians and activists and interest groups think of themselves as working from a pre-Obamacare policy baseline . And this , in in turn , creates a strong political reluctance to propose alternatives that deviate from that baseline in ways that might negatively impact the groups  including , as Barro says , the overwhelmingly insured Republican electorate  that the party has tried to rally against the health care law from the beginning .But the first moment when a Republican Congress might actually be able to pass a health care overhaul wont arrive until February of 2017 , at which point Obamacare will have been the baseline for two years  the new taxes , the subsidies , the mandates , the higher premiums , the Medicare cuts , the Medicaid expansion , all of it . And at that point , the plausible right-of-center alternatives to Obamacare will no longer look risky and disruptive relative to the status quo , because that status quo will no longer be one that Republican interests and voters are deeply invested in defending . Instead , those interests and voters will be looking for ways to limit the health care laws impact , and the conservative alternatives will look more like what they actually are  proposals that spend less , regulate less , and reflect a greater confidence in markets than the presidents new law , and that would change the underlying health care system in ways that a sensible G.O.P . should support .This may be too optimistic , I admit . Maybe Ted Cruz will be elected president on a platform of repeal-plus-nothing ; maybe Hillary Clinton will be elected president and the G.O.P . will go on fundraising off Obamacare without ever figuring out how to change it ; maybe a Republican Congress and a Republican President will fall short of repeal but tinker with the law in ways that are more destructive than constructive . But I do think that the more serious policy alternatives on the right will look a lot better , both to the G.O.P.s true believers and its strategic cynics , in world where Obamacare is the policy of the land as well as the law , and where the partys base is no longer being invited to imagine that it can be pre-emptively wiped out ."

Two recent pieces on this subject recommend themselves : One is in the latest National Affairs , where Thomas Miller offers an extended reality check on the pressing need for and current unreadiness of Republican health care alternatives ; the other is over at Bloomberg View , where Ramesh Ponnuru presents a gentle critique of one such alternative , from the Republican Study Committee , praising some of its features while suggesting ( correctly ) that it would need to include an actual tax credit for the purchase of insurance to represent a plausible replacement for the presidents health care law .The absence of such a credit , sadly , is not a coincidence . As Ive noted before , a lot of Congressional Republicans are resistant to the more plausible conservative proposals on health care precisely because they dont want to find the money required to make any of them work  in some cases because they prefer the comforting illusion that the current system represents some sort of free market ideal that would be wrecked if we started providing tax credits to the currently-uninsured , and in other cases because theyre all-too-aware that some of that money would have to come from caps and cuts that affect groups that currently vote Republican . This has left health care as the glaring exception to the pattern of policy innovation I discussed in Sundays column : The partys populists have been willing to take interesting risks on a variety of issues , but on health care its mostly just been repeal , repeal , repeal with entirely-insufficient gestures offered as replacements .Which is why Josh Barro , professional scourge of G.O.P . unseriousness , feels comfortable dismissing Millers argument ( and by implication , Ponnurus ) as follows:Though Miller spends 6,000 words laying out his health policy vision , he never explicitly notes two facts about his approach : It would cost a lot of taxpayer money to implement , and it wouldnt achieve universal health coverage . The former makes the approach a nonstarter for so many conservatives that no Republican Congress would ever implement it . The latter makes it unsaleable to the broader electorate .On the second point , I think hes mistaken , or at least oversimplifying ( not least because Obamacare itself doesnt achieve universal health coverage ) , but Ill just direct you to Reihan Salams comments on the universality issue and focus on Barros first claim : That no Republican Congress would ever implement the ideas that conservative policy wonks have proposed .For this Republican Congress hes most likely right , the efforts of a few lawmakers notwithstanding , for the reasons sketched above . For the next one or especially the one after that , though , I think the calculus could very easily change . Thats because right now , with the new health care law as-yet-unimplemented , were still in a world where the G.O.P.s politicians and activists and interest groups think of themselves as working from a pre-Obamacare policy baseline . And this , in in turn , creates a strong political reluctance to propose alternatives that deviate from that baseline in ways that might negatively impact the groups  including , as Barro says , the overwhelmingly insured Republican electorate  that the party has tried to rally against the health care law from the beginning .But the first moment when a Republican Congress might actually be able to pass a health care overhaul wont arrive until February of 2017 , at which point Obamacare will have been the baseline for two years  the new taxes , the subsidies , the mandates , the higher premiums , the Medicare cuts , the Medicaid expansion , all of it . And at that point , the plausible right-of-center alternatives to Obamacare will no longer look risky and disruptive relative to the status quo , because that status quo will no longer be one that Republican interests and voters are deeply invested in defending . Instead , those interests and voters will be looking for ways to limit the health care laws impact , and the conservative alternatives will look more like what they actually are  proposals that spend less , regulate less , and reflect a greater confidence in markets than the presidents new law , and that would change the underlying health care system in ways that a sensible G.O.P . should support .This may be too optimistic , I admit . Maybe Ted Cruz will be elected president on a platform of repeal-plus-nothing ; maybe Hillary Clinton will be elected president and the G.O.P . will go on fundraising off Obamacare without ever figuring out how to change it ; maybe a Republican Congress and a Republican President will fall short of repeal but tinker with the law in ways that are more destructive than constructive . But I do think that the more serious policy alternatives on the right will look a lot better , both to the G.O.P.s true believers and its strategic cynics , in world where Obamacare is the policy of the land as well as the law , and where the partys base is no longer being invited to imagine that it can be pre-emptively wiped out ."
1	"OK , I just created an Obamacare account for myself ( if I broke any laws , please , it was just investigative journalism ) . I went all the way through the process at healthcare.gov , stopping before the final step of actually applying ( I dont qualify , of course , because Princeton provides insurance ) , just to see how hard it was . And the answer is that it was no problem at all , with no delays .I also used the information only feature to get a listing of plans in my area . Again , no problem . And healthcare.gov directs you to Kaiser for an estimate of subsidies and final cost .Now , I know that this is only part of the story , and were still not getting clear answers on how well the 834 transmissions  which send the information to insurers  are working . But the visible parts of the process bear no resemblance to the horror stories of a few weeks ago .Why did I carry out this little exercise ? Well , I scanned the comments on todays column and noticed a lot of people reporting having successfully enrolled in Obamacare  not at one of the well-functioning state exchanges , but at the supposedly disastrous healthcare.gov . Just anecdotes , I know  but anecdotes suggesting that the system is no longer the black hole of yore .In short , its looking increasingly likely that the story from here on is going to be one of steadily better news  of growing enrollment in the federal as well as state exchanges , of people discovering either that their insurance has gotten better and cheaper or that they can afford insurance for the first time . Bit by bit these stories will percolate into the news media , replacing the sob stories about cancelled policies .And I find myself wondering what Republicans will do . Or actually , not so much . As Martin Longman noted over the weekend , Obamacare already looks like one of those Republican obsessions  like Benghazi  where the party has convinced itself that there must be a pony winning issue hidden in there somewhere , and that if only it keeps flogging the thing , long after the public has moved on , it will eventually score big .Im not saying that the botched rollout is irrelevant : it has badly hurt Obama , and may do damage that lasts into the midterms . But the facts on the ground are changing , and my very strong guess is that the GOP will undo a lot of its gains by refusing to acknowledge that change ."

1	"OK , nothing is sure in this world . Intrade is still giving Obamacare a 2.2 % chance of failing , and I suppose Bart Stupak might have a Bwahahaha moment on the House floor . But it looks as if health reform has been achieved .There is , as always , a tunnel at the end of the tunnel : well spend years if not decades fixing this thing . But kudos to all involved , with special praise for Nancy Pelosi , who is now a Speaker for the ages .PS : I really did take that photo , but it was back in January . Right now Im back in central New Jersey ."
1	"OK , so Obama did a terrible job in the debate , and Romney did well . But in the end , this isnt or shouldnt be about theater criticism , it should be about substance . And the fact is that everything Obama said was basically true , while much of what Romney said was either outright false or so misleading as to be the moral equivalent of a lie .Above all , theres this:MR. ROMNEY : Let  well , actually  actually its  its  its a lengthy description , but number one , pre-existing conditions are covered under my plan .No , they arent . Romneys advisers have conceded as much in the past ; last night they did it again .I guess you could say that Romneys claim wasnt exactly a lie , since some people with preexisting conditions would retain coverage . But as I said , its the moral equivalent of a lie ; if you think he promised something real , youre the butt of a sick joke .And were talking about a lot of people left out in the cold  89 million , to be precise .Furthermore , all of this should be taken in the context of Romneys plan not just to repeal Obamacare but to drastically cut Medicaid .So enough with the theater criticism ; Romney needs to be held accountable for dishonesty on a huge scale ."

1	"OK , the plan is out . Basically , it splits the difference between the House and Senate bills , with a set of measures that can be passed through reconciliation . Igor Volsky has a nice table doing the comparison . Since the House bill is better than the Senate bill , and the Senate bill is much better than nothing , this should be a go .What I hear is that at this point the House is a bigger problem than the Senate . Pelosi  and Obama  have to drive home the following points : 1 . This is the last chance to do HCR for years to come , and America desperately needs this 2 . For their own sake , Democrats have to run on a record of having achieved something .Im not in a position to do nose-counts , but Im guardedly optimistic ."

1	"ORLANDO , Florida  Florida 's own health insurance marketplace , long touted by Republican lawmakers as a free-market solution to providing affordable health coverage , is expected to launch as early as next week .Six years in the making , Florida Health Choices will open for business with an inventory of products that can not legally be marketed using the words insurance , coverage , benefits or premiums , according to Chief Executive Officer Rose Naff .The brainchild of U.S . Senator Marco Rubio while he was a state legislative leader in 2008 , Florida Health Choices has been held up by advocates as a better alternative to President Obama 's signature Affordable Care Act .Signed into law in 2010 , the U.S . Affordable Care Act , also known as Obamacare , went live on October 1 and by late January had enrolled 3 million people .The law created state-based online health insurance exchanges that opened on October 1 for coverage on January 1 and sell plans with minimum benefit requirements .The Florida products do not meet the comprehensive requirements of Obamacare , and Naff said there is no timetable for Florida Health Choices to offer broader insurance plans that meet the new federal benefit standards .Subsidies provided in the federal program would also not be available through the state site .`` We are not competing with the federal exchanges , '' Naff said .Naff said Florida Health Choices initially will make available five types of discount cards that offer purchasers a better deal on certain dental , vision , prescription or chiropractic services .The cards , which are offered by Careington International based in Frisco , Texas , will cost $ 6 to $ 25 a month , depending on the services selected .Naff said other products , including limited-benefit insurance plans , which focus on single medical issues such as cancer or vision , will be rolled out at a later date .Florida is one of 36 states where the federal government is running the exchange , called HealthCare.gov . The other 14 states run their own exchanges .Naff said there are 1.3 million people in Florida who are uninsured and ineligible for subsidies in the federal marketplace .Florida has about 3.8 million uninsured people , or about 20 percent of its population , according to the U.S. Census Bureau .Florida 's Governor Rick Scott signed off on state funding of Florida Health Choices while trying to block the Affordable Care Act and rejecting millions of federal dollars to implement it in the state .Florida led the legal challenge against Obamacare , but the U.S. Supreme Court in 2012 upheld most provisions of the act . Scott continued to throw roadblocks in the way of Obamacare , banning `` navigators , '' volunteers who help consumers sign up for insurance in the federal marketplace , from operating out of state-funded county health departments .The state marketplace was No . 87 in Rubio 's 2006 book , `` 100 Innovative Ideas for Florida 's Future , '' published months before he took over as leader of the Florida House . Rubio made the marketplace a priority and obtained $ 1.5 million in start-up funding in 2008 . Another $ 900,000 of state funding was awarded in 2013 .`` Florida Health Choices is a program based on principles ObamaCare violated , '' a spokeswoman for Rubio said in a statement on Friday . `` There are no mandates , trillions in new spending , or bureaucratic rules to come between patients and their doctors , '' she added .Greg Mellowe , policy director at Florida CHAIN , a statewide consumer health advocacy group , said the state 's version provided `` an illusion of coverage . ''`` In some cases , these things are not insurance at all , '' Mellowe added .Naff said potential Florida Health Choices customers are 525,000 adults who make too much money to qualify for Medicaid . Those same people would qualify for Medicaid coverage if Florida 's Republican-dominated legislature would accept $ 51 billion from the federal government to expand Medicaid 's income guidelines , Naff said .The legislature , whose leaders fought the Affordable Care Act , declined the money in 2013 .Other potential customers are about 800,000 non-citizens living in the state who are not eligible under the Affordable Care Act , Naff said .( Additional reporitng by Zachary Fagenson and Caroline Humer .

1	"ORLANDO , Florida  Republican David Jolly won an expensive battle to fill a vacant U.S. Congressional seat in a special election watched by both major parties for what it portends for November when all 435 congressional seats will be up for grabs .Jolly , 41 , defeated Democrat challenger Alex Sink , 65 , a former state chief financial officer , by 3,500 votes or a 1.87 percent margin - 48.43 percent to 46.56 percent , according to the Pinellas County Supervisor of Elections website .Libertarian candidate Lucas Overby took 4.83 percent of the votes .Republicans were quick to declare the result a repudiation of President Obama 's Affordable Healthcare Act , known as Obamacare .Jolly 's victory `` shows that voters are looking for representatives who will fight to end the disaster of Obamacare , to get Washington to spend our money responsibly , '' Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement .Jolly did not mention Obamacare in his victory speech and said that his margin of victory was too slim to `` take a mandate from this . ''In his victory speech , Jolly spurned national attention on the election . `` This race is not about defending a broken agenda in Washington , '' he told supporters . `` This race is about ... . serving the people right here in our own community . ''Sink had held a slight lead in the polls throughout the campaign against Jolly , a Republican lobbyist in Washington , D.C. , but may have been hurt by poor turnout of 39 percent , far below the 2012 election .Florida 's is a big swing state , with 27 seats in the House of Representatives , tied with New York state for the third largest delegation in the nation , and behind only California and Texas .A Democratic victory would have been a major blow to the Republican party heading into the fall mid-term elections , as well as the next presidential race in 2016 . Democrats hold the advantage in the more liberal south of the state and Republicans prevail in the conservative north , while central Florida is more evenly split .The Tampa area Gulf Coast district has been a comfortable Republican seat for decades , held for more than 40 years by Jolly 's former boss , U.S. Representative C.W . Bill Young , a Republican who died in October aged 82 .Young won the seat in 2012 by almost 50,000 votes and a margin of 15 percent . However , the district was won by President Barack Obama in 2012 , according to the Tampa Bay Times .Voters were hit with more than $ 10 million worth of television advertising and other campaign material financed in large part by the national parties and partisan groups hoping a victory in this race will signal the prospect of a bigger win in the November mid-term elections .`` You can see the handprints of the national parties all over the race , '' said Susan MacManus , a longtime political analyst and professor at the University of South Florida in Tampa .`` It almost seems as if the 2012 presidential race never ended , and just the faces and the district changed . ''Sink slammed Jolly as a Washington lobbyist for special interests , while Jolly fired back at Sink for being close to President Obama and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi .Republicans hold a 2.4 percent edge in voter registration in Florida 's congressional district 13 , which lies within Pinellas County on the state 's west coast .MacManus said an early focus on Obamacare got little traction because older voters were not affected . Sink switched to criticizing Jolly for representing a client who wanted to privatize Social Security and turn Medicare into a voucher program , changes Jolly said he does not support .`` This is a strategy I think Democrats are looking at nationally to change the focus from Obamacare to Social Security and Medicare , '' MacManus said .Following the election , MacManus expects both parties to use the Tampa Bay area , the nation 's 10th largest television market and home to 25 percent of all registered Florida voters , as a political laboratory to conduct focus group surveys on the campaign strategies .It was a crushing defeat for Sink who narrowly lost the election for state governor in 2010 against Republican Rick Scott .Sink conceded victory soon after the results were announced but did not say whether she will challenge Jolly again in November when his seat is up again for election .( Writing by David Adams ; Editing by Ken Wills )"
1	"ORLANDO  Diners at a Florida restaurant chain are being asked to pay a health insurance surcharge on their meal tabs to cover the cost for business owners of the Obama administration 's new healthcare program .Customers at eight Gator 's Dockside restaurants dotted around central and north Florida are finding a 1 percent surcharge on their bills listed as `` ACA , '' the letters standing for the Affordable Care Act , popularly known as Obamacare .Lengthy signs on the front door and a plastic-coated letter delivered to tables with the menu warn diners of the fee . `` The costs associated with ACA compliance could ultimately close our doors , '' the letter reads under the company letterhead .A $ 14.56 lunch tab for Asian salad and iced tea ordered by a reporter at a Dockside restaurant in the town of Clermont , a short drive west of Orlando , included a 13-cent ACA surcharge .Dockside said it wants to continue to offer full-time employment so its employees do n't have to work multiple jobs to make a living .`` Therefore , instead of raising prices on our products to generate the additional revenue needed to cover the cost of ACA compliance , Gator 's Dockside has implemented a 1 percent surcharge on all food and beverage purchases only , '' the notice adds .`` People got ta do what they got ta do to obey the law , '' said local business owner Sean Gumbert , 40 , a lunchtime customer at Gator 's Dockside in Clermont who opposes Obamacare .But other diners , including several who did n't like Obamacare , were less sympathetic to the restaurant 's dilemma , saying insurance was just another cost of doing business , similar to other business taxes , and had no place on a meal tab .`` It 's a game . If you want to play the game , customers can play the game too . Instead of 20 percent tip , he ( the waiter ) gets 18 percent , '' said Joe Lee , a retired federal worker .`` We did n't do this for any , any , any , any , any political reasons , '' said a company official who answered the phone at the company 's Orlando headquarters , but asked not to be named .`` It was done in all the greatest intentions . It was done to give everybody full healthcare without knocking their hours down and not charging ridiculous amounts of money to do it , '' he said .The Affordable Care Act requires all businesses with more than 50 full-time employees to provide health insurance for their staff , or to make a shared payment on their federal tax return . Originally due to go into effect in January , the requirement has been postponed until the end of the year .A dozen other independently owned restaurants in the Gator 's Dockside franchise are not imposing the surcharge .`` It 's clearly political , '' said Hank Fishkind , an Orlando-based economic consultant , noting that the company could have increased its meal prices to cover the extra healthcare cost without advertising it .`` If they want to display their politics in this way , that 's their right . Some customers , depending on their politics , might like it . Others will not , '' he said .Fishkind said he was unaware of any other company making a similar move , though some Florida hospitality firms have complained about the requirement under Obamacare to provide health insurance for part-time labor .`` It is a real issue , particularly in a state like Florida , because we have a concentration of restaurants and lodging companies , '' he said .( Writing and additional reporting by David Adams ; Editing by Jonathan Oatis )"
1	"October 1 is a watershed moment for Obamacare , because thats the day people can start signing up for health insurance , online , through public exchanges . But against this backdrop , there are also signs of a sea change in how private employers will offer health insurance .WNYCs Money Talking looks at how companies like Walgreens , IBM and Time Warner will offer health insurance as Obamacare takes effect . Joe Nocera and Rana Foroohar of Time magazine join Charlie Herman to discuss whether this is the beginning of the end of employer-paid healthcare ."
1	"Of course , they dont . But much of the argument over health care amounts to insisting that they do .Aaron Carroll catches Steve Pearlstein saying that Obamacare and Ryancare are the same thing:Democrats have been equally hysterical in attacking Ryancare as a throw-Grandma-under-the-bus scheme to balance the budget , even as they proudly defend the health reform law for everyone else .As Carroll said , this is wrong in part because Ryancare would dismantle the much better system  Medicare  that seniors already have , while Obamacare would provide insurance to those who would not have it otherwise .But beyond that , the subsidies in the health care law are supposed to make care affordable ; the vouchers in Ryancare are not , and in fact would be grossly inadequate .So the argument that Ryancare is just like Obamacare is like saying that the company janitor , who gets paid $ 18,000 a year , and a senior vice president who gets paid 20 or 30 times that much both get paid salaries , so hey , they get exactly the same deal !Its truly amazing that the Very Serious dont get this point ."
1	"Oh , my . Aaron Carroll is rightly very , very annoyed at Douglas Holtz-Eakin and Arik Roy for saying that Obamacare should be replaced with a free-market system , like Switzerlands . As he points out , the Swiss system is nothing like their description . In particular , they denounce community rating  but Switzerland has community rating !Actually , though , its even worse than Carroll lets on , for two reasons .One is that Obamacare in fact looks a lot like , you guessed it , the Swiss system  so much so that back in 2009 I described it as a plan to Swissfy America . After all the screaming about the awfulness of Obamacare , its pretty rich to hold up as a role model a very similar system .But wait , theres more : the Swiss system is more privatized than other European systems  and guess what , it has higher costs , indeed second only to Americas:Maybe Holtz-Eakin doesnt know anything about this  but wasnt Roy supposed to be a conservative expert in this field ? Are they really unaware of the basics here ? Or do they just expect their readers to be easily fooled ?"

1	"One big concern about health reform has been the argument that the individual mandate  which is essential to keeping the risk pool broad enough  wont work , because the penalties for noncompliance are too weak . But Austin Frakt does some calculations which seem to suggest that the penalties for noncompliance under Obamacare are , if anything , slightly stronger than under Romneycare  and that since gaming of the system doesnt seem to be a large problem in Massachusetts , it probably wont be a big problem nationally .Hmm . What if this reform works better than its advocates claimed ?"
1	"One of the Senates top Democrats said Tuesday that it was a political mistake to pass the Affordable Care Act in 2010 , because voters at the time were looking for relief from the recession  not universal health care .In remarks at the National Press Club , Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York said Democrats should have built on the stimulus package that passed Congress and used it to create programs to help middle-class Americans .Unfortunately , Democrats blew the opportunity the American people gave them ,  Mr. Schumer said , according to his prepared remarks . We took their mandate and put all of our focus on the wrong problem  health care reform.Mr. Schumers calculus could seem coldly political . He points out that only a third of the uninsured population is even registered to vote . To aim a huge change in mandate at such a small percentage of the electorate made no political sense ,  he said . So when Democrats focused on health care , the average middle-class person thought the Democrats are not paying enough attention to me.Republicans , he added , were able to exploit a sense among voters that Democrats were interested in creating new government programs that did not benefit them , helping to spawn the Tea Party movement .Republicans and the anti-government Tea Party filled that vacuum and spent 2010 convincing the average American that not only did Obamacare not work for them , not only would a parade of horribles emerge ,  he said , but they turned Obamacare into a general metaphor and falsely convinced the electorate that government couldnt work anywhere."
1	"Opponents of the Affordable Care Act yesterday seized on a Congressional Budget Office report on the labor market , claiming it indicated that health reform would kill 2 million jobs . Actually , as our editorial on the subject explained , the C.B.O . predicted a reduction in the number of full-time workers . That may sound like a distinction without a difference , but its not . Job-killing implies layoffs ; whereas the report found that many workers would choose to leave their positions  because they no longer have to depend on their employers for health insurance .Since theres been so much confusion on this vital point , I thought Id highlight what Douglas Elmendorf , the C.B.O . budget director , told the House Budget Committee on Wednesday . He clearly distinguished between getting laid off and choosing not to work:The reason that we dont use the term lost jobs is because there is a critical difference between people who would like to work and cant find a job  or have a job that was lost for reasons beyond their control  and people who choose not to work . If someone comes up to you and says , Well the boss says Im being laid off because we dont have enough business to pay me ,  that person feels bad about that and we sympathize with them for having lost their job . If someone says , I decided to retire or stay home and spend more time with my family or spend more time doing my hobby ,  they dont feel bad about it  they feel good about it . And we dont sympathize . We say congratulations . And we dont say theyve lost their job . Weve say theyve chosen to leave their job."
1	"Our topic for today is : looking on the post-election bright side .The polling places hadnt even opened before the Senates right-wing firebrand , Ted Cruz , was demanding that the majority-leader in-waiting , Mitch McConnell , take a hard line against President Obama or risk losing his new job . Cruz is from Texas , and he wants to recreate the Alamo , if you can imagine Obamacare in disguise as the Mexican Army .Think of that as a plus . The one thing McConnell and his supporters dislike more than the Democratic agenda is Ted Cruz . It could be an important bonding opportunity . President Obama has never spent much time with the Republican leadership , but now you can sort of imagine them sitting around , sipping drinks and making fun of what Cruz said on Fox News .Another potential downer : Republicans have fewer veteran women in the Senate , so when they take over there will be fewer women running important committees . But , on the plus side , the overall number of women in Congress will rise , albeit at a rate that would get us to equal representation sometime around 2078 . Once all the votes are counted , Debbie Walsh , the director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University , says the percentage of women in the House and Senate , now 18.2 percent , will , at best , go up to maybe 19.3 percent .Were calling it Not a Landmark Year ,  Walsh said .This could be a useful exercise in living with lowered expectations . Washington might actually want to embrace Not a Landmark Year as a slogan . If Ted Cruz tries to get the House Republicans to run the country off a fiscal cliff , the moderates could start chanting : NALY ! NALY ! Lets try one more positive interpretation of what the election has wrought : Theres a school of thought that believes Tuesday was actually a great day for reproductive rights . Let me take you through it .The front lines of the anti-abortion movement belong to the personhood people , who strive to give constitutional rights and protections to the preborn from the moment of conception . When Americans are confronted with this idea , they quickly come to hate it . Personhood amendments have been defeated wherever they pop up , including Mississippi . This year , one was rejected in Colorado for the third time , by around 65 percent to 35 percent . A personhood amendment lost in North Dakota , 64 percent to 36 percent . In addition , the state senator who was its major sponsor lost her re-election bid , as did one of the measures more outspoken House supporters .We are only mentioning those last details because the number of state legislators who are defeated for re-election in this country is about as low as the number of state legislators who are endowed with the power of levitation .This year , not only were the personhood proposals rejected , candidates who had previously supported the movement started madly backing away . The most famous example was in Colorado , where Representative Cory Gardner , the Republican Senate candidate , suddenly realized a state personhood amendment was a bad idea. In a move that left debate questioners incredulous , Gardner insisted that a personhood bill he had co-sponsored in Congress would have no effect , but was simply a statement that I support life.Gardner also announced that he believed birth control pills should be available over the counter . He made a TV ad about it and sent out pink mailings .Gardners turnaround was so swift and strange that the incumbent senator , Mark Udall , made it the center of his campaign . A Denver Post editorial claimed it was Udalls obnoxious obsession . Now to me , obnoxious is a candidate who steals his opponents yard signs . Or who opposes abortions except for the one he pressured his mistress to get , like that guy in Tennessee . But whatever . Udall lost .Planned Parenthood sent out a press release describing Colorado as an absolute triumph : Voters have made clear that you cant win statewide elections in Colorado by openly opposing womens health and restricting access to safe and legal abortion.The theory here  and I am really going to go with it  is that the real story is not anti-choice Republicans weaseling around their political history , but voters of America forcing anti-choice candidates to change their positions .Cory Gardner ran aggressively as a supporter of womens issues . It was sort of a miraculous conversion . Well be happy to hold him to it ,  said Cecile Richards , the president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund , in a phone interview .The question is what happens when people like Gardner get into office . McConnell promised that hed bring up a bill in the Senate banning abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy . Would the repentant personhood backers go along ? At the very least , they would appear to be obliged to add language vastly expanding womens access to free birth control .O.K. , its not an ideal compromise . But then its not a landmark year ."
1	"PERRY , Ga.  One Republican highlights the nation 's lackluster recovery since the Great Recession . Less than an hour later , another GOP candidate from the same state gets attacked for it .Candidates everywhere this midterm election season are struggling for ways to frame the state of the economy , ranked by voters as the most important issue . The result is a blame game that cuts in multiple directions depending on the contest  even , in one case , within the same state .For example , Georgia Republican Senate nominee David Perdue does n't miss a chance to blame President Barack Obama and a Democratic-led Senate for the nation 's slow economic recovery .`` This president sold us a bill of goods , '' Perdue told a raucous crowd at the Georgia state fairgrounds during a debate with Democratic nominee Michelle Nunn this week . `` We have fewer working today than at any time since Jimmy Carter was president . ''Within moments , the state 's Republican governor , Nathan Deal , stood on the same stage while his Democratic challenger  Carter 's grandson  sharply blamed the governor for Georgia 's 8.1 percent unemployment rate , which in August was the nation 's highest .`` You have watched this economy in Georgia leave the middle class behind , '' said Jason Carter , a state senator .Even in states where rising unemployment might offer tempting targets , many candidates fear unintended consequences and political boomerangs if they delve too deeply into economic debates .Democrats in Republican-run states worry that an emphasis on economic woes might reflect badly on Obama , and by extension , themselves . But Republicans in those same states often worry that highlighting a shaky economy will reflect badly on the GOP governor and other Republicans .Perdue took that risk in Georgia , but other Senate candidates are more cautious .North Carolina is an example . The August unemployment rate was 6.8 percent , up from 6.2 percent in April  a potential opportunity for Sen. Kay Hagan , the Democrat seeking a second term .She accuses her Republican challenger  state House Speaker Thom Tillis  and GOP Gov . Pat McCrory of spearheading ill-advised tax and spending cuts . Hagan says their cuts to education funding drove away teachers this year and will hurt North Carolina 's job growth in future years .But Hagan had said little about the higher unemployment rate until she was asked about it in an Oct. 7 debate . She alluded to state legislative actions when she said Tillis ' tax and jobs policies were `` sending our teachers to Texas , our film jobs to Georgia and our Medicaid dollars to 28 states . '' Over Hagan 's objections , North Carolina 's GOP-controlled government declined a federally funded Medicaid expansion .Tillis ' approach : `` Government kills jobs , '' he said . `` Small businesses , large businesses create jobs . ''Outside the debate format , Tillis and Hagan tend to emphasize other issues .`` It 's a tough issue for both campaigns because neither one knows who the public will blame , '' said Thomas Mills , a Democratic blogger who has worked for statewide campaigns . Hagan has gained traction lately by hitting Tillis on education and tax issues , Mills said , `` so I 'm not sure she wants to change the subject right now . ''The story is similar in several other states with tight Senate races . Republicans need six more seats to control the chamber .In many states , Republicans seem content to stick with their longtime favorite issue : attacking the president 's health care overhaul , widely known as `` Obamacare . '' And several Democrats want to distance themselves from Obama , which complicates any effort to tout an improving economy associated with him .The national unemployment rate is 5.9 percent , the lowest in six years . But local unemployment rates have ticked up recently in four states with sharply contested Senate races : North Carolina , Louisiana , Alaska and Georgia .The unemployment rate has fallen in Colorado and Kentucky . It has been flat lately in Iowa , Arkansas and Kansas . All those states have contested Senate races .Unemployment plays a bigger role in races for governor , a post more directly associated with a state 's economy .In Wisconsin , Democrat Mary Burke centers her challenge to GOP Gov . Scott Walker on his failed promise to create 250,000 private-sector jobs . Wisconsin has the nation 's 17th-lowest unemployment rate , 5.6 percent .In Georgia , Carter is trying to deny Deal a second term as governor . Perdue and Nunn are running for the Senate seat being vacated by Republican Saxby Chambliss .Voters are left to decide who is responsible for the sluggish job growth in a state run by Republicans while the federal government is split between a GOP-run House and a Democratic-led Senate and White House .Even in states with falling unemployment rates , Senate candidates are reluctant to highlight the news .Kentuckians watching political TV ads might think their state 's unemployment rate , at 7.1 percent , has risen instead of fallen lately .Allies of Sen. Mitch McConnell , the Republican seeking a sixth term , have run ads in which a Kentucky coal miner says he lost his job thanks to a `` war on coal . '' McConnell repeatedly says Obama wages such a war with help from Democratic candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes , even though she sharply criticizes the president 's coal policies .___Babington reported from Washington ."
1	"PICKENS , Ark .  In a Senate race as pivotal as any in the country , Arkansas Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor is running against Republican Rep. Tom Cotton , who is running against President Barack Obama .All else is secondary , including a clash over agriculture and issues , a caustic tidal wave of television ads washing over voters and an intensive effort by Democrats to register thousands of new voters in a state that has turned several shades redder since Obama took office .Cotton is `` the only member of the Arkansas delegation , House or Senate , Republican or Democrat , to vote to raise the age for Medicare to 70 , '' Pryor said recently as he issued a campaign booklet that detailed spending cuts he said his opponent has supported in Congress . He also frequently points out that his challenger was the only lawmaker from Arkansas to oppose the most recent farm bill .Cotton 's reply ? The 37-year-old first-term House member scarcely seems to utter a sentence that does n't include the president 's name .`` I vote a hundred percent of the time with Arkansas ' best interests . He votes 93 percent of the time with Barack Obama , '' he said , adding : `` I do n't know many Arkansans who think that Barack Obama is right 93 percent of the time . ''Cotton is one of the many Republicans to inject Obama forcefully into his campaign in a year the GOP is battling for control of the Senate . Yet the Democrats ' multimillion-dollar program to turn out new , midterm election voters in key states will be tested in Arkansas as much as anywhere , given recent polls suggesting an exceedingly close race .Obama 's unpopularity in Arkansas is not in dispute , despite a Democratic tradition so thick that Roosevelt Road carries traffic up to the perimeter of the Bill and Hillary Clinton National Airport in the capital city . Six years ago , Pryor had no Republican opposition for re-election . Democrats held the state 's other Senate seat and three of four House seats .Enter the nation 's first black president , who drew less than 40 percent of the vote in the state in winning campaigns in 2008 and 2012 , and whose ratings now are in the low- to mid-30s . Pryor , now the only Democrat left in the state 's congressional delegation , concedes his try for a new term is probably made tougher by Obama 's shadow .Georgia Bowen , making calls at the Democratic phone bank in Little Rock , is an enthusiastic supporter of the health care law that Republicans first tagged  scathingly  with Obama 's name .`` When they 're calling it 'Obamacare ' they 're trying to insert race into something where race does n't belong , '' said the former teacher .Ninety miles away , William Moore , who served in the Pacific in the Air Force during the Vietnam era , cites two reasons he supports Cotton .`` He 's a veteran , '' he says , referring to the congressman 's tour in Afghanistan in an Army unit . And , `` I think he wants to do away with Obamacare . I 'm in favor of that . ''Cotton emphasizes his roots on an Arkansas farm in a recent television commercial , which appears designed to blunt Pryor 's attacks on his vote against the farm bill . And he travels in a campaign bus with a military-camouflage design on its exterior . He enlisted in 2005 , a few years after graduating from Harvard Law School .In the House , he voted for budgets advanced by the Republican Study Committee , conservatives who want to eliminate federal deficits faster than other Republicans , and are willing to back spending cuts that cause others to flinch .That gives rise to Pryor 's charge that Cotton supports increasing the age of eligibility for Social Security and Medicare . It 's unclear what sort of credence voters give to the charge .`` You hear that all the time , '' says James Wilkerson , 64 , tending the cash register at the Pickens Store and Restaurant , where Cotton mingled with a few dozen lunchtime patrons . `` I have n't seen any evidence of that . ''If voters are just getting to know Cotton , Pryor needs no introduction .The 51-year-old lawmaker has a family political bond with the voters reaching back decades . It was first forged by his father , former two-term governor and three-term Sen. David Pryor , who retired in 1996 and now campaigns with his wife , Barbara , for their son .She delivers a pep talk to the phone bank volunteers calling in search of new voters and sums up Democratic fears succinctly . `` Bad leaders are elected by good people who fail to vote , '' she says .Cotton has a different view , and Obama  not surprisingly  figures into it .`` Only in the last four or five years have the conservative values of Arkansas begun to move toward the Republican Party , '' he said in an interview . `` People like my parents , who were lifelong Democrats , realize that the Obama Democrats really do n't represent those conservative views and values .

( Reuters ) - The state of Oregon sued Oracle America Inc. and six of its top executives Friday , accusing the software giant of fraud for failing to deliver a working website for the Affordable Care Act program .The 126-page lawsuit , filed in Marion County Circuit Court , claims that fraud , lying and `` a pattern of racketeering '' by Oracle cost the state and its Cover Oregon program hundreds of millions of dollars .`` Not only were Oracle 's claims lies , Oracle 's work was abysmal , '' the lawsuit said . Oregon paid Oracle about $ 240.3 million for a system that never worked , the suit said .Oracle issued a statement saying the suit `` is a desperate attempt to deflect blame from Cover Oregon and the governor for their failures to manage a complex IT project .

The state plan , called Cover Oregon , ran quirky , engaging television commercials and print ads in advance of the rollout .But , the Oracle-built site never worked and Oregonians were forced to submit paper applications in a hastily-organized process .

1	"PORTSMOUTH , New Hampshire  Former U.S . Senator Scott Brown of Massachusetts launched a Republican campaign on Thursday to represent neighboring New Hampshire in the Senate , with an attack on incumbent Democrat Jeanne Shaheen 's vote for Obamacare .Brown , who moved to his native New Hampshire late last year to explore a run for office , has focused much of his energy on attacking the Affordable Care Act , an issue Republicans are making a centerpiece of 2014 campaigns .`` So many problems with our economy happened because of Obamacare . And Obamacare could not have happened without a rubber-stamp 'yes ' vote from Senator Shaheen , '' Brown told a crowd of a couple hundred supporters in a hotel ballroom in Portsmouth , New Hampshire , near the state 's southern coast .`` Obamacare forces us to make a choice , live free or log on - and here in New Hampshire , we choose freedom , '' Brown said .The Affordable Care Act passed the U.S. Senate in 2010 by a margin of 60-39 , with all Democrats , including Shaheen , voting in favor of President Barack Obama 's top domestic priority .Technical glitches plagued the new system 's rollout . Obamacare is less popular in New Hampshire than nationally , according to February poll , which found 53 percent of adults in the state opposing the law and 34 percent favoring it .Despite the early problems , the White House released figures last week showing that 7.1 million people had enrolled through the new exchanges , exceeding most expectations .New Hampshire Democrats note that the state 's legislature recently voted to accept federal subsidies expanding the Medicaid health care program for the poor in New Hampshire , a move made possible by the Affordable Care Act .`` Scott Brown may find that what he thinks the public 's attitude here in New Hampshire is , may not be what he finds when he gets around the state because repealing the Affordable Care Act means repealing health care for 50,000 citizens , '' said New Hampshire statehouse Speaker Terie Norelli , a Democrat .Before any matchup with Shaheen , Brown faces a competitive Republican primary in September , with his leading rival Bob Smith , a conservative who is trying to reclaim a seat he held from 1990 to 2003 .GAINING GROUNDBrown has already won support from national Republican groups eager to reclaim a majority in the Senate , which Democrats currently control by 55 seats to the Republican 's 43 .Two polls of New Hampshire voters released on Thursday showed him gaining ground on Shaheen .Public Policy Polling found 49 percent of 1,034 New Hampshire voters would vote for Shaheen and 41 percent for Brown in a head-to-head matchup . Prior polls had given Shaheen , a former governor , a wider lead on Brown .A WMUR television poll , with a sample size of 387 likely voters found Shaheen with a narrower 45-39 lead .Brown 's strong anti-Obamacare stance drew divided reaction from New Hampshire voters .Bill Gannon , a 51-year-old theater-curtain business owner from Sundown , said he 'd become interested in Brown in part because of his anti-Obamacare message .`` I do n't like the new healthcare law , '' said Gannon , who had joined the crowd in the hotel ballroom to hear Brown speak . `` We need the Senate back and this is a guy who 's electable . ''Outside , 80-year-old Joan Webber of Kensington , New Hampshire , who was holding a sign reading `` Scott Brown is a twerp '' said he supported Shaheen and the Affordable Care Act .`` He probably has his insurance already , '' Webber said of Brown . `` He just does n't want the poor to get it .

1	"POTOMAC , Md .  Working to fill campaign coffers for House Democrats , President Barack Obama poked fun at Republicans on Monday for placing an election-year focus on the deadly attacks in Benghazi , Libya , and his namesake health care law rather than on issues he deemed more serious .Standing between two flags in a white tent erected outside a supporter 's sprawling home , Obama pointed the finger at the GOP and charged his political opponents with employing an election strategy based around making Americans cynical , angry and suspicious enough that they vote for Republicans in the next election .`` The debate we 're having right now is about what , Benghazi ? Obamacare ? It becomes this endless loop , '' said an incredulous Obama . `` It 's not serious . It 's not speaking to the real concerns that people have . ''It was a rare moment where the president 's frustration with the GOP 's incessant focus on his political weaknesses bubbled to the surface .Republicans have spent recent weeks pummeling Obama and his administration over the 2012 attack in Libya that took place on Obama 's watch . For Obama , the renewed focus on Benghazi , where four Americans died , only replaces one headache with another ; until recently , Republicans had been laser-focused on pushing repeal of Obama 's unpopular health law as a way to score points with voters in November .It 's not true that Democrats are behaving as unreasonably as Republicans , Obama insisted , adding that the GOP has been `` captured '' by a group that 's unserious and ineffective .`` I hate to be blunt about it , but that 's the play , '' Obama told about 65 supporters who paid up to $ 32,400 per couple for a chance to have dinner with the president . Joining them were a list of bold-named Democratic figures , including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Maryland Gov . Martin O'Malley , who is considered a potential presidential candidate in 2016 .This is the fifth time Obama has made the money pitch for House Democrats this year  one of more than 20 fundraisers Obama has agreed to do through the summer for Democratic-aligned campaign groups .Democrats are anxiously working to protect their fragile majority in the Senate , and would need a net gain of 17 seats this year to seize the majority from Republicans . But a combination of Obama 's low approval ratings , an unfavorable electoral map and historical trends are all working against Democrats to dampen the party 's prospects in November .To that end , Obama was careful not to raise Democrats ' hopes too high . Rather than urging donors to pony up big so Democrats can win back control of the House , Obama offered a more modest goal:`` We 've got to make sure that Democrats are making progress this midterm , '' he said .___"
1	"PROVIDENCE , R.I.  President Obama on Friday promoted his proposals to raise wages and expand benefits for working women , making an election-season push to portray Republicans as stuck in the past and hindering an economic recovery .We need Republicans in Congress to stop blocking a minimum-wage increase ,  Mr. Obama said at Rhode Island College , where he highlighted elements of his agenda aimed at helping women , including paid leave , pay equity and the health care laws required insurance coverage for mammograms .Weve got to raise our voices ,  the president said , to do away with policies and politicians that belong in a Mad Men episode. He was referring to the period television drama focusing on a male-dominated advertising agency in the 1960s .The speech came in the middle of a campaign swing Mr. Obama is making through Democratic strongholds in advance of next weeks elections , but it steered almost entirely clear of electoral politics .Instead , the presidents comments were carefully tailored to burnish his credentials and boost his partys image with women , an influential voting bloc , without explicitly tying Democratic candidates to Mr. Obama . In one of his final appearances before the midterm congressional contests next Tuesday in which his partys control of the Senate is at stake , the president never mentioned voting or the campaign .This shouldnt be partisan ,  he said at one point .Mr. Obama refrained from linking his agenda to the election or to Democratic candidates as he did earlier this month during an economic speech in Evanston , Ill. , in which he said his economic policies were on the ballot this fall even though he personally was not . That remark drew grumbling from some Democrats and party strategists who said it risked undermining candidates attempts to appeal to swing voters who are dissatisfied with Mr. Obama .Still , the president seized the opportunity on Friday to claim credit for fueling an economic recovery and making health care more affordable over the opposition of Republicans .No matter how many times Republicans threaten to repeal this law , were going to keep it in place ,  Mr. Obama said of the Affordable Care Act , claiming vindication about its key provisions . Im pretty sure that , you know , in 10 years theyre not going to call it Obamacare anymore . Republicans will be like , Oh , I was for that. Thats how that works.He also pointed to job gains that have taken hold during the past five years and a government report on Thursday showing the economy grew at an annualized rate of 3.5 percent in the third quarter .If you care about these policies , youve got to keep pushing for them ,  Mr. Obama said .It was an economic message in stark contrast to the presidents surroundings  a state whose unemployment rate is among the nations highest , where Gina Raimondo , the Democrat running for governor , speaks often of how the state has been left behind the rest of the nations recovery .We really are in a jobs crisis ,  Ms. Raimondo said in a brief interview before Mr. Obamas speech , noting that Rhode Islands unemployment rate is 7.6 percent , much higher than the 5.9 percent national average . In Providence , the state capital where the president appeared , the rate is 10 percent . My whole campaign is just pounding that message ,  she said .Of the economic rebound Mr. Obama so often mentions , Ms. Raimondo said , We just havent felt it here.The speech came in the middle of a five-state campaign tour Mr. Obama has been making to boost Democratic candidates for governor , with stops planned for Saturday in Detroit and on Sunday in Bridgeport , Conn. , and Philadelphia . In the races final days , the president is staying out of the most important battleground states , although he is tracking the races from afar ."
1	"Perceptions about health reform are in an interesting place . Just about everyone on the right is still living in October , the annus horribilis of Obamacare ( yes , I know it was just a month , and I dont care ) , and is waiting to move in for the kill after the whole thing collapses . Meanwhile , a funny thing has been happening : enrollments surged this month , to such an extent that the original expectation of 7 million people signed up via the exchanges by the end of March no longer looks crazy .OK , the usual caveats : we dont know how many of the people signing up via the exchanges are replacing existing policies , and we dont know how much trouble there will be when people start trying to use their new insurance . On the other hand , we know that there are a substantial number of people buying ACA-compliant policies directly from insurers , who dont show up in the numbers yet .And while 7 million has become the number to match or beat , the truth is that it doesnt matter too much if only 6 million sign up via the exchanges , plus millions more who are signed up under expanded Medicaid . Even a slightly disappointing first year will still offer enough people benefits to make reform politically irreversible .At this point , we have more than 2 million signed up via the exchanges and more than 4 million added to Medicaid . Both numbers will grow a lot over the next three months . This is pretty close to the end game ."
1	"Politics | If Tom Daschle succeeds in passing Obamacare , he might also kill conservatism , a columnist writes . He says look at the introduction of nationalized health care in Britain , which turned conservative-leaning workers into long-term believers in the Labor Partys social safety net . Blocking Obamas health plan is key to the G.O.P.s survival ,  says a libertarian analyst . [ U.S. News & World Report ]"
1	"President Obama is finally making a strong case for his own health reform , mocking Republicans for their obsession with denying insurance to 30 million Americans . Its about time ; and many of us still feel that he did a remarkably bad job of explaining the reform in the past .Still , Brian Beutler has a good point here : the long delay in implementation made Obamacare hard to campaign on , because people had no experience of how it works in practice . Republicans could tell all kinds of lies , promulgate all kinds of misconceptions , and if the laws defenders tried to refute these claims , well , who was telling the truth ? Remember how Medicare was going to destroy American freedom ?But now the reality of Obamacare is just months away . It may have a rocky start , especially in red states where the local government is doing all it can to disrupt the implementation , but pretty soon many Americans will have first-hand knowledge of how the system really works . And if Massachusetts is any guide , theyre going to like it a lot .Hence Obamas new confidence and the desperation of the GOP ."
1	"President Obamas name wont be on any ballots Tuesday , but he will most certainly be on them in spirit  a fact that many Republicans are trumpeting and some Democrats are hoping to downplay .The president is not particularly popular at the moment .According to Gallups Frank Newport:President Obamas job approval rating is 42 percent . If that holds up until the day before the election , it will be the second-lowest job approval rating for a president before a midterm election going back to 1982 when Ronald Reagan , of course , was president of the U.S. What was the lowest of all ? That was George W. Bushs , whose job approval rating was 38 percent back in 2006.On a host of issues , foreign and domestic , large and small  the rise and spread of the Islamic State , the Russian aggression into Ukraine , the federal response to the Ebola crisis in West Africa and the panic here , the crisis of children from Central America crossing our Southern border , the Internal Revenue Service , the Secret Service , Obamacare and , of course , Benghazi  conservatives have attacked . They have used each as yet another plank to construct their government-as-House-of-Horrors argument about a Washington that is mismanaged and out of touch , overreaching but outmatched .And in their propaganda , this idea of an ineffectual , and ultimately dangerous , government has a face : Obamas . Republicans arent running on issues as much as running against an individual and an idea ; they are running against Obama and the very idea of federal government , except as defined by the most narrow of functions .Others believe that there is also something else at play , implicitly or explicitly : race . Last week NBCs Chuck Todd asked Senator Mary Landrieu , the Louisiana Democrat locked in a tight re-election race , why President Obama has a hard time in her state . One of the reasons she gave was this : Ill be very , very honest with you . The South has not always been the friendliest place for African-Americans.This is the great immeasurable when it comes to this man . Race is a construct that , unfortunately , is woven through the fabric of America . Of course , it has some bearing on our politics , but its nearly impossible to calculate the degree of the effect for a particular politician . And there can be benefit as well as detriment  pride and prejudice as counterweights .As Obama himself told The New Yorker in January : Theres no doubt that theres some folks who just really dislike me because they dont like the idea of a black President.He continued : Now , the flip side of it is there are some black folks and maybe some white folks who really like me and give me the benefit of the doubt precisely because Im a black President.As Gallup pointed out last week : We find very little change in the support given to Obama among his strongest demographic subgroup : black Americans. The report continued , In fact , if anything , the trend is for relatively higher support among blacks when measuring the gap between black support for Obama and the national average .The president is now playing to those black folks in a last-ditch effort to help Democrats maintain Senate control , even as much of the betting money is on the real possibility that Republicans will wrest control away .According to a New York Times analysis of voter data earlier this month : African-Americans could help swing elections in Georgia , Louisiana , North Carolina and possibly Arkansas ,  but , the article says , only if they turn out at higher-than-forecast rates.So , the president has been making direct appeals to this group on black radio stations across the country . Obamas appeals appear to be working , at least as measured by the composition of early-voting tallies . As The New York Timess Nate Cohn pointed out last week in The Upshot:The turnout among black voters is particularly encouraging for Democrats , who need strong black turnout to compete in racially polarized states like Georgia and North Carolina . In those two states , black voters so far represent 30 percent of the voters who did not participate in 2010 . By comparison , 24 percent of all those who voted in those states in 2010 were black.Black support is particularly important this cycle since support among Hispanic voters is showing signs of weakening . A Washington Post/ABC News poll released last week showed that , among Latinos , 50 percent say it doesnt matter who wins the Senate come November . And among those who do think it will matter , twice as many say it would be a good thing ( 30 percent ) if the G.O.P . took over as say it would be a bad thing ( 15 percent ) .Its not clear whether President Obama can energize enough black voters to save Democratic control of the Senate , but he seems ever more reliant on this group to give him the benefit of the doubt and ride to his rescue ."

1	"RACINE , Wis.  Rick Santorum urged Republicans here Sunday evening to carefully study the record of Mitt Romney , declaring : He is the worst Republican in the country to put up against Barack Obama.At the final campaign rally of a weekend trip to Wisconsin , Mr. Santorum sharpened the tenor of his argument against Mr. Romney during an appearance here at the South Hills Country Club . He offered a litany of reasons for why he said he believed Mr. Romney presented a weak contrast to Mr. Obama , particularly on health care .Pick any other Republican in the country ,  Mr. Santorum told supporters here . He is the worst Republican in the country to put up against Barack Obama . Why would Wisconsin want to vote for someone like that ? Mr. Santorum , who was criticized by Republicans last week after suggesting that there was little difference between electing Mr. Obama or Mr. Romney , grew angry after his speech when asked to expound on his comment about Mr. Romney being the worst Republican.What speech did you listen to ?  Mr. Santorum told The New York Times , speaking in a terse and agitated tone . I said he was the worst Republican to run on the issue of Obamacare . Thats what I was talking about.Mr. Santorum , as he signed autographs along a rope line , continued to raise his voice and suggested the media had been distorting my words. He used an expletive to make his point , saying again that it was Mr. Romneys health care record  not his positions in general  that make him the worst Republican to run against Mr. Obama .On the issue of health care , yes , thats what I was talking about ,  Mr. Santorum later told reporters . Obamacare , as you heard me say."

1	"RICHMOND , Virginia  U.S . Senator Mark Warner holds a 15-point lead among Virginia voters over Republican challenger Ed Gillespie , but the Democrat 's support for Obamacare could cost him votes in the November election , according to a poll released on Thursday .Warner is favored by 46 percent of voters as he seeks a second term , compared with 31 percent for Gillespie , a former chairman of the Republican National Committee , according to the Quinnipiac University survey . Libertarian Robert Sarvis has 6 percent backing .Warner voted in 2010 for the Affordable Care Act , or President Barack Obama 's signature healthcare reform , which has had a troubled launch . Virginia voters oppose the healthcare law 52 percent to 44 percent , the poll showed .Voters in Virginia , a swing state in presidential elections , said 45 percent to 31 percent that they were less likely to vote for a Senate candidate who supported the health care law .Warner has said that he was upset by the difficult roll-out of the Affordable Care Act . He has urged supporters and opponents of the legislation to work together to solve its problems .Gillespie , a former Washington lobbyist and counselor to Republican President George W. Bush , opposes the Affordable Care Act .Warner is among the third of the 100-member Senate up for election in November . Republicans believe they have a good chance to pick up the six seats they need to take control of the Senate based on public dissatisfaction with Obama and concerns about Obamacare .Democrats are defending 21 seats , including Warner 's , to 14 for Republicans .Voters say 33 percent to 15 percent they would be less likely to vote for Warner if Obama campaigned for him , the poll showed .Peter Brown , assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll , said Warner enjoyed high name recognition and a strong job approval rating , at 55 percent .He is in the range that suggests that an incumbent is a heavy favorite for re-election , Brown said in a statement accompanying the poll .Gillespie , who has never held elective office , still has to introduce himself to Virginia voters , though his background in national politics will help him raise money , Brown said .The poll of 1,288 voters was conducted March 19 to 24 and has a margin of error of 2.7 percentage points .( Editing by Ian Simpson and Stephen Powell )"

Still , it looks as if the biggest complaint against Obamacare was completely wrong : cost control is one of the things that is really , really working , with huge positive fiscal implications .If they get the enrollment process working  its getting better , but we still dont know if its moving fast enough  this is still going to go down in the long run as a policy triumph ."

1	"Remember the death tax ? The estate tax is quite literally a millionaires tax  a tax that affects only a tiny minority of the population , and is mostly paid by a handful of very wealthy heirs . Nonetheless , right-wingers have successfully convinced many voters that the tax is a cruel burden on ordinary Americans  that all across the nation small businesses and family farms are being broken up to pay crushing estate tax liabilities .You might think that such heart-wrenching cases are actually quite rare , but youd be wrong : they arent rare ; theyre nonexistent . In particular , nobody has ever come up with a real modern example of a family farm sold to meet estate taxes . The whole death tax campaign has rested on eliciting human sympathy for purely imaginary victims .And now theyre trying a similar campaign against health reform .Im not sure whether conservatives realize yet that their Plan A on health reform  wait for Obamacares inevitable collapse , and reap the political rewards  isnt working . But it isnt . Enrollments have recovered strongly from the laws disastrous start-up ; in California , which had a working website from the beginning , enrollment has already exceeded first-year projections . The mix of people signed up so far is older than planners had hoped , but not enough so to cause big premium hikes , let alone the often-predicted death spiral.And conservatives dont really have a Plan B  in their world , nobody even dares mention the possibility that health reform might actually prove workable . Still , you can already see some on the right groping toward a new strategy , one that relies on highlighting examples of the terrible harm Obamacare does . Theres only one problem : they havent managed to come up with any real examples . Consider several recent ventures on the right:_ In the official G.O.P . response to the State of the Union address , Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers alluded to the case of Bette in Spokane ,  who supposedly lost her good health insurance coverage and was forced to pay nearly $ 700 more a month in premiums . Local reporters located the real Bette , and found that the story was completely misleading : her original policy provided very little protection , and she could get a much better plan for much less than the claimed cost ._ In Louisiana , the AstroTurf ( fake grass-roots ) group Americans for Prosperity  the group appears to be largely financed and controlled by the Koch brothers and other wealthy donors  has been running ads targeting Senator Mary Landrieu . In these ads , we see what appear to be ordinary Louisiana residents receiving notices telling them that their insurance policies have been canceled because of Obamacare . But the people in the ads are , in fact , paid actors , and the scenes they play arent re-enactments of real events  theyre emblematic ,  says a spokesman for the group ._ In Michigan , Americans for Prosperity is running an ad that does feature a real person . But is she telling a real story ? In the ad , Julia Boonstra , who is suffering from leukemia , declares that her insurance has been canceled , that the new policy will have unaffordable out-of-pocket costs , and that If I do not receive my medication , I will die. But Glenn Kessler of The Washington Post tried to check the facts , and learned that thanks to lower premiums she will almost surely save nearly as much if not more than she will be paying in higher out-of-pocket costs . A spokesman for Americans for Prosperity responded to questions about the numbers with bluster and double-talk  this is about a real person suffering from blood cancer , not some neat and tidy White House PowerPoint.Even supporters of health reform are somewhat surprised by the rights apparent inability to come up with real cases of hardship . Surely there must be some people somewhere actually being hurt by a reform that affects millions of Americans . Why cant the right find these people and exploit them ?The most likely answer is that the true losers from Obamacare generally arent very sympathetic . For the most part , theyre either very affluent people affected by the special taxes that help finance reform , or at least moderately well-off young men in very good health who can no longer buy cheap , minimalist plans . Neither group would play well in tear-jerker ads .No , what the right wants are struggling average Americans , preferably women , facing financial devastation from health reform . So those are the tales theyre telling , even though they havent been able to come up with any real examples .Hey , I have a suggestion : Why not have ads in which actors play Americans who have both lost their insurance thanks to Obamacare and lost the family farm to the death tax ? I mean , once youre just making stuff up , anything goes ."
1	"Representative Aaron Schock is a conservative Republican from Illinois , but not conservative enough for the hard-right activist group Club for Growth , which is seeking someone to run against him in next years primary .His crime ? In 2011 , he voted to increase the debt ceiling , and , in 2012 , he voted for a stopgap spending bill that prevented a government shutdown . In neither case did he demand the defunding of health care reform .Club for Growth and other extremist groups consider a record like his an unforgivable failure , and they are raising and spending millions to make sure that no Republicans will take similar positions in the next few weeks when the fiscal year ends and the debt limit expires .If youre wondering why so many House Republicans seem to believe they can force President Obama to accept a defunding of the health care reform law by threatening a government shutdown or a default , its because these groups have promised to inflict political pain on any Republican official who doesnt go along .Heritage Action and the Senate Conservatives Fund have each released scorecards showing which lawmakers have pledged to defund Obamacare. When a senator like Tom Coburn of Oklahoma refuses to pledge , right-wing activists are told : Please contact Senator Coburn and tell him its dishonest to say you oppose Obamacare , but then vote to fund it . Tell him he swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution.Mr. Schock and 10 other lawmakers considered suspiciously squishy by the Club for Growth were designated as RINOs ( Republicans in name only ) , and the club has vowed to find primary opponents and support them with cash  a formidable threat considering that it spent $ 18 million backing conservative candidates in the 2012 cycle . Americans for Prosperity , a Koch brothers group that has already spent millions on ads fighting health reform , is beginning a new campaign to delay the laws effects .These groups , all financed with secret and unlimited money , feed on chaos and would like nothing better than to claim credit for pushing Washington into another crisis . Winning an ideological victory is far more important to them than the severe economic effects of a shutdown or , worse , a default , which could shatter the credit markets .They also have another reason for their attacks : fund-raising . All their Web sites pushing the defunding scheme include a big donate button for the faithful to push . With your donation , you will be sending a strong message : Obamacare must be defunded now ,  says the Web site of the National Liberty Federation , another social welfare group that sees dollar signs in shutting down the government .Brian Walsh , a longtime Republican operative , recently noted in U.S. News and World Report that the right is now spending more money attacking Republicans than the Democrats are . Money begets TV ads , which begets even more money for these groups personal coffers ,  he wrote . Pointing fingers and attacking Republicans is apparently a very profitable fund-raising business.It may be good for their bank accounts , but the combination of unlimited money and rigid ideology is proving toxic for the most basic functioning of government ."
1	"Representative Tom Cotton spoke President Obamas name far more often than he mentioned his opponent , the Democratic incumbent , Mark Pryor , in the first half-hour of their debate tonight .In one five-minute period , Mr. Cotton said Obama or Obamacare 15 times and , among other things , blamed the Affordable Care Act for the rise in student loan rates and Mr. Pryor for increased tuition at the University of Arkansas .When it was Mr. Pryors turn , he sought to score points by pointing out four times in one answer that Mr. Cotton attended Harvard . He probably couldnt get into the University of Arkansas ,  the senator joked , before growing more serious . He uses Harvard to pursue his political career."
1	"Republican candidates are falling madly in love with contraception .Who knew ?I believe the pill ought to be available over the counter , round the clock , without a prescription  cheaper and easier , for you ,  declares Colorado Senate candidate Cory Gardner in a new ad . Hes running against the Democratic incumbent , Mark Udall , in a close race .Meanwhile , in North Carolina , during a Senate debate this week , Republican Thom Tillis announced that he , too , strongly believed over-the-counter oral contraception should be available without a prescription.Tillis , a longtime politician , had never mentioned this big idea before . Until the debate , his most famous collision with womens reproductive rights came when , as speaker of the State House , he allowed the Republican majority to add a last-minute amendment to a bill on motorcycle safety reducing access to abortions .So big surprise from Thom Tillis . The same thing , more or less , has happened in Senate races in Virginia and Minnesota . Republicans in close elections suddenly turn into cheerleaders for over-the-counter birth control pills . A negative and suspicious mind might almost suspect they were following a script .During one recent U.S. House debate in Colorado , the Republican incumbent , Mike Coffman , said in an answer to a moderators question that he was pro-life , then quickly added : But I support a womans access to ... to , uh ...Um , certainly to this Hobby Lobby decision , to get ... Painful moments of groping , flailing . What the heck do you call that stuff ? Finally , a merciful member of the audience shouted : Birth control.Birth control !  cried Coffman with relief .Were entering another election season in which womens issues loom large . ( In North Carolina , one recent poll showed the gender gap between Tillis and his Democratic opponent , Senator Kay Hagan , is 32 percent . ) The Republicans are trying to avoid the disastrous tone-deafness that cropped up two years ago when a leading Senate candidate suggested that a gal could not get pregnant if she was raped . This season , Democrats have been eagerly looking for similar fodder . So far , theres been nothing quite that awful , although its pretty clear there are folks who still havent gotten with the program . Male invitees to an event for Florida Congressman Steve Southerland were told to tell the misses not to wait up because the after-dinner whiskey and cigars will be smooth & the issues to discuss are many.A spokesman for Southerland indignantly told BuzzFeed , which first obtained the invitation , that rather than focusing on nonsense stories ,  reporters should be asking Southerlands opponent about Obamacare . Truly , there is nothing that can not be dismissed by bringing up the Affordable Care Act . Total miracle that the ex-governor of Virginia chose to defend himself against corruption charges by claiming his wife was a terrible person when he could just as easily have argued that taking money from a dietary supplement salesman was not nearly as bad as Obamacare .I digress . About the pill . There was a time when the Republican Party championed family planning and access to contraception . But that was , you know , before disco . Now its a rare Republican candidate who can latch onto a major nomination without calling for an end to abortion rights and the defunding of Planned Parenthood . Many of them have also signed on to the personhood movement , which wants to provide legal rights to every fertilized egg in the country . This idea , with its potential impact on access to birth control , is so unpopular that it failed by a landslide in Mississippi .All this can create problems for the womens vote in general elections . In Colorado , the Democrats have pointed out endlessly that Cory Gardner supported personhood amendments to the State Constitution . After he seemed to be losing ground , Gardner said that when personhood came up in 2008 and 2010 he did not really understand the possible consequences . ( This was a bad idea driven by good intentions. )Now think about this for a minute . Imagine youre a politician in a state thats considering an amendment to the state constitution that is very controversial and all about womens reproduction . Pretend its on the ballot the same time when youre running for Congress . Pretend youre very , very concerned with womens access to contraception .At what point would you say to yourself : Wow , I wonder if this could have any impact on birth control ?  Choose from the following:A ) First time the subject came up .B ) Not actually until a week before the election because it was a tough year and I had home repair issues to deal with .C ) Some undetermined point between the day the amendment failed by 3 to 1 and , um , right this minute .Yes ! In Gardners case the answer is C .In every election , voters ask the candidates : What have you done for me lately ?  In this case , we might also want to know what they were doing last year ."
1	"Republicans are doing their best to persuade Americans that the Affordable Care Act will drive health insurance premiums so high that consumers will experience rate shock. That fear-provoking tale seems much less credible now that the rates proposed by health insurers for individual coverage on the new health care exchanges have been made public in several states . For the most part , the premiums will increase only slightly or even decrease for individuals and family coverage on the exchanges , electronic marketplaces in which consumers choose among a variety of plans with differing benefits and costs .The reported rates are in states that have elected to run their own exchanges , which are set to start enrolling people in October for coverage that begins in January 2014 . Many states with Republican governors have refused to set up exchanges and have left that task to the Obama administration . In 19 states where the exchanges will be entirely run by the federal government , more health insurance companies are entering the markets and injecting competition that should help hold down costs , the administration said on Thursday . Premiums are subject to many competing pressures , but , in several states , competition appears to be offsetting factors that might push rates up .In California , officials announced last week that 13 insurers were awarded contracts to sell policies on the states health care exchanges next year . The companies submitted bids , which came in much lower than virtually all experts and actuaries had forecast .Blue Shield of California said that its premiums for individual customers would increase about 13 percent on average next year over current premiums ; about 8 percent of that increase would the cover rising cost of medical care , which would have happened anyway . The other 5 percent pays for better benefits , guaranteed coverage for pre-existing conditions , and taxes and fees imposed on insurers by the reform law .About 2.6 million people in California are likely to be eligible for federal subsidies on the exchanges based on their incomes , which will lower the costs they have to pay , in some cases substantially . Californias success lies in aggressive negotiations by officials of the independent state agency running the exchanges with the health plans to keep insurance bids low . That led some insurance companies , in turn , to bargain down the prices charged by hospitals and doctors to care for their enrollees .Similar good news came from an analysis of five other states  Maryland , Oregon , Rhode Island , Vermont and Washington . A Democratic Congressional staff analysis issued last week found no evidence of widespread rate shock and considerable evidence that consumers will benefit from better coverage at lower cost . In Oregon and Washington , the analysis found , consumers who want to remain with their current insurer could get comparable coverage next year for less than they are currently paying . Consumers can save even more by looking for cheaper policies on the exchanges .The big challenge in all states will be to get people enrolled in coverage . California , where Democrats control the state government , is expected to mount a strong effort to sign up people . Republicans in Congress , however , are doing their best to block money needed for outreach programs . Private groups will need to help pick up the slack ."
1	"Republicans have been focusing on the messiness of the Obamacare rollout , and thats perfectly legitimate . It has been very messy . Some liberals think they shouldnt acknowledge the problems , because that just gives the critics more talking points . I disagree : The rollout has been a disaster , and President Obama was misleading when he said everyone could keep their existing insurance . Lets not disguise the truth .But as Republicans segue to the broader issue of health care reform and try to re-litigate Obamacare itself , its also worth remembering that the United States has a poorly performing and highly expensive health care system that desperately needs broader accessand thats just what Obamacare does , albeit not very elegantly .Its important to talk about studies showing that the United States has shorter life expectancy and higher infant mortality than other industrialized countries , but it also helps to put a human face on the problem . Thats what I do in my Sunday column . Id welcome your comments ."
1	"Republicans would like the country to believe that they took control of the Senate on Tuesday by advocating a strong , appealing agenda of job creation , tax reform and spending cuts . But , in reality , they did nothing of the sort .Even the voters who supported Republican candidates would have a hard time explaining what their choices are going to do . Thats because virtually every Republican candidate campaigned on only one thing : what they called the failure of President Obama . In speech after speech , ad after ad , they relentlessly linked their Democratic opponent to the president and vowed that they would put an end to everything they say the public hates about his administration . On Tuesday morning , the Republican National Committee released a series of get-out-the-vote images showing Mr. Obama and Democratic Senate candidates next to this message : If youre not a voter , you cant stop Obama.The most important promises that winning Republicans made were negative in nature . They will repeal health care reform . They will roll back new regulations on banks and Wall Street . They will stop the Obama administrations plans to curb coal emissions and reform immigration and invest in education .Campaigning on pure negativity isnt surprising for a party that has governed that way since Mr. Obama was first sworn in . By creating an environment where every initiative is opposed and nothing gets done , Republicans helped engineer the presidents image as weak and ineffectual . Mitch McConnell , who will be the Senates new majority leader , vowed in 2009 to create an inventory of losses to damage Mr. Obama for precisely the results achieved on Tuesday .Mr. McConnell was assisted in this goal by the presidents own second-term stumbles  most notably the disastrous rollout of the Affordable Care Act last year , an indecisive foreign policy , and revelations of domestic surveillance and improper veterans care . Republicans were also able to exploit nativist fears about immigrant children crossing at the southern border and some initial troubles in responding to the first domestic cases of Ebola .In some races , missteps by the Democrats helped Republicans . In Iowa , Representative Bruce Braley may have cost himself the race by making a belittling comment about farmers . In Kentucky , Alison Lundergan Grimes didnt establish a reputation for candor when she refused to discuss her previous votes for president .Virtually all Democratic candidates distanced themselves from Mr. Obama and refused to make the case that there has been substantial progress on jobs and economic growth under this administration .But Republicans also had little to say about reviving the economy , and their idea of creating jobs seems to be limited to building the Keystone XL oil pipeline , cutting taxes further and crying repeal Obamacare at every opportunity .In theory , full control of Congress might give Republicans an incentive to reach compromise with Mr. Obama because they will need to show that they can govern rather than obstruct . They might , for example , be able to find agreement on a free-trade agreement with Pacific nations .But their caucuses in the Senate and the House will be more conservative than before , and many winning candidates will feel obliged to live up to their promises of obstruction . Mr. McConnell has already committed himself to opposing a minimum-wage increase , fighting regulations on carbon emissions and repealing the health law .Just because we have a two-party system doesnt mean we have to be in perpetual conflict ,  Mr. McConnell said in his victory speech . As the new Senate leader , he must now prove those are not empty words ."
1	"Responding to my weekend column , which gently pushed back against the sudden burst of liberal optimism about HealthCare.Gov , Ezra Klein gently pushes back against my point that Obamacares quest to enroll the young and healthy faces bigger hurdles than did its model , Romneycare , in Massachusetts:Medicare Part D is left off this list , as often happens . But its the more direct comparison . It , too , was a polarizing national law that suffered from a terrible rollout . At launch , it was less popular even than Obamacare . In May 2006  so , five months after its launch  a CBS/New York Times poll found 48 percent of seniors said they didnt plan to join and 81 percent said the George W. Bush administration should extend the deadlines . A Gallup poll from about the same time showed 53 percent of seniors thought the law flatly wasnt working .But the program didnt fail . Mark McClellan , who led the rollout effort , recalls that by the spring of 2006 most seniors signed up . Every senior had heard about this program or knew people in it . And everyone was familiar with the delayed enrollment penalty . Those things together led to a big bump before open enrollment ended. Today Medicare Part D is widely considered a success . Over 90 percent of seniors say theyre happy with it .Its true that the Medicare Part D analogy gets cited by Obamacare defenders more often than by the new health care laws skeptics . Sometimes Part Ds example is invoked to criticize Republicans for their continued obstructionism ( because after all Democrats mostly voted against the prescription drug benefit , but didnt throw up endless roadblocks to its implementation ) , and sometimes , as in this instance , to cite a happy case where a health care law with a faulty website and flawed rollout ended up becoming pretty popular . But both comparisons have always seemed flawed to me , for the following interrelated reasons:1 ) Medicare Part D faced political opposition , but not intense ideological resistance . The bill wasnt a conservative pet project or the fulfillment of a long-running right-wing dream ; rather it was an attempt at centrist co-option by the Bush administration , which his base swallowed because it seemed politically necessary . Meanwhile , Democrats who opposed the legislation mostly did so not not because they hated the concept , but because they wanted a more generous , more socialized bill  which is to say , they were taking the position vis-a-vis Part D that their partys leftward fringe took vis-a-vis Obamacare  and because they didnt want to let Bush get the credit on an issue they felt they owned . Its not surprising , then , that even when the law was unpopular it didnt generate resistance and create high ideological drama  that there was no repeal Part D movement on the left in 2004 or 2006 or 2008 , no liberal equivalent of Ted Cruz trying to leverage the issue for his own ambitions , no talk about how the entire conservative project was on the line when the website wasnt working . Whatever their objections to the form it took , Democrats explicitly wanted something like Part D , which meant that even during its flawed rollout there was an implicit bipartisan , pan-ideological consensus around the program that has never existed around Obamacare .2 ) Medicare Part D did not depend on the same kind of mandate-regulate-subsidize model as Romneycare and Obamacare  not least because it was a more narrowly-focused program than either  which meant that its architects had less reason to fear a death spiral during the initial period of bureaucratic chaos . Yes , Part D imposed a delayed enrollment penalty ,  as Klein notes , on seniors who signed up for Medicare when they turned 65 but then waited for years to sign up for the prescription drug benefit . But there was no requirement that seniors sign up , no annual penalty for waiting , and neither the premiums nor the fine were nearly as central to the laws design as the individual mandate is to Obamacare . Whats more 3 ) Signing up for Medicare Part D was vastly cheaper than signing up for Obamacare . Was , and is : Today the average Part D monthly premium is just $ 31 , while the average premium for a health insurance plan on the national exchange is about ten times that much . If the average Obamacare plan cost just a few hundred dollars a year to enroll , the short-term financial case for signing up would be much stronger , and the dangers of adverse selection much lower . Its because the new laws plans cost thousands of dollars , potentially , that theres a serious risk that precisely the people the law needs to sign up will choose to remain uninsured . And because of that price differential , the example of Medicare Part Ds eventual enrollment success doesnt necessarily tell us all that much about what the Obamacare pool will look like a year or five years hence .The point of elaborating these three differences , incidentally , is not to argue that Part D was brilliant legislation , and Obamacare is necessarily doomed . The two programs do have significant elements in common , some of their differences redound to Obamacares credit ( Part D rather famously didnt even try to be deficit neutral , a standard the new health care law at least attempts to meet ) , and some of their similarities could be folded into a case that Obamacare could work out better than its doubters expect . ( There were reasons to think that Part D would also come in way over budget ; instead , it beat expectations , and the slowdown in health care costs that liberals are now suddenly crediting to Obamacare actually kicked off around the time Part D passed . )But when it comes to the specific question of whether Obamacare is going to have trouble meeting its young-and-healthy quota , Im just not sure Medicare Part D has that much to teach us . That program was less polarizing and less furiously opposed , it cost far less to join , and it wasnt built around the same kind of cross-subsidization model as the Affordable Care Act . It had a rocky rollout , just as Obamacare has had a rocky rollout . But what it needed to recover was not identical to what the new law needs now , and over the next few years , to be reasonably considered a success ."
1	"Returning from his Hawaiian vacation on Air Force One overnight , President Obama offered a brief assessment of the Republicans who will return to Washington Wednesday , saying that he expects Republicans to play to their base for a certain period of time.But Mr. Obama said he believes the Republicans in the Senate and the new leadership in the House will eventually play down politics in 2011 to focus on improving the nations economy .My expectation , my hope is that John Boehner and Mitch McConnell will realize that there will be plenty of time to campaign for 2012 in 2012 ,  Mr. Obama told reporters . And that our job this year is to make sure that we build on recovery . We started making good progress on that in the lame-duck , and I expect to build on that progress when I get back.That may be more hope than expectation . Even as Mr. Obama boarded his plane to head home , Mr. Boehner who will be installed as speaker of the House on Wednesday , sent a very clear and precise signal to his base : Im with you .Days before officially assuming power , Mr. Boehner began the process necessary to vote on the health care repeal . By posting the proposed repeal legislation online Monday night , Mr. Boehners Republican-controlled House said they could take a final vote on repeal next week .BREAKING ,  said a Twitter message sent out by Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia , the new majority leader . House # GOP to move this week on # ObamaCare repeal.The message included the subject hashtag  # teaparty ,  an overt acknowledgement of the intended recipients .Mr. Boehners Republicans are moving methodically to begin their control of the House with a series of mostly symbolic gestures aimed at the Tea Party conservatives who helped them seize control of the chamber last November .Republicans in the House also will have the entire Constitution read aloud from the floor of the chamber . The move is a shout-out to the new Tea Party lawmakers , who have argued that Washington has strayed too far from the intentions of the Constitutions authors .And shortly after that , Republicans in the House will vote on legislation to cut the office budgets of House members and committees by five percent . The move , which will save a tiny $ 35 million or so , is a symbol of the partys intent to control spending , Republicans said .But it is the health care vote , which is scheduled for January 12 , will set the tone for the opening of the 112th congress .Obamacare is a job killer for businesses small and large , and the top priority for House Republicans is going to be to cut spending and grow the economy and jobs ,  Brad Dayspring , a spokesman for Mr. Cantor , said in a statement . Further , Obamacare failed to lower costs as the president promised that it would and does not allow people to keep the care they currently have if they like it . That is why the House will repeal it next week.Brad Woodhouse , a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee , said Republicans are going to ram through a bill over the objections of millions of Americans to deny people access to affordable health care.Mr. Woodhouse added : This from a party that complained bitterly that Democrats rushed through health care reform after a year of debate and dozens of Congressional hearings.Aboard Air Force One , the president declined to answer a reporters question about the move by House Republicans to try and repeal the health care legislation passed last year .Asked specifically what he thinks of GOP plans to repeal health care , the president paused but began to back out of the press cabin and didnt answer .Alright , guys ,  he said , adding : Thank you , guys . Happy New Year."

1	"SACRAMENTO , California  Julie Davis has every reason to be skeptical of Obamacare : She 's a Republican , her father is a physician who is wary of socialized medicine and her insurance was canceled because of new requirements imposed by the healthcare law this year .But the 44-year-old filmmaker says her decision to seek coverage under President Barack Obama 's healthcare reform was a practical one , made with little political angst but plenty of doubt over whether the program will really benefit her family .`` I did approach it with a skeptical eye , '' said Davis , who lives in Los Angeles with her husband and son . `` But it 's not political . We have no choice . ''After several weeks researching the new health plans , Davis signed up for a mid-tier `` silver '' plan for the three family members at $ 930 a month , slightly more than their previous policy purchased on the individual market , but with a far lower deductible .Davis 's choice underscores the disconnect between Washington politics - particularly the Republican Party 's push to kill Obama 's Affordable Care Act and portray the law as an ill-devised social program bound to fail - and the experiences of at least some rank-and-file party members who are finding practical reasons to sign up . The discrepancy may complicate GOP efforts to use voter dissatisfaction over Obamacare 's troubled launch to win control of the Senate in November .The sharply polarized national argument over the U.S. healthcare system does not line up neatly with the needs of American households . Consumers opposed to the law may find a better deal under Obamacare , which offers subsidized coverage to lower-income households , bars insurers from excluding people on the basis of prior illness and mandates full coverage of common preventive health services . At the same time , some of the law 's supporters may also have lost health insurance policies they liked or encounter higher prices for their coverage .For some , the journey to Obamacare has been uncomfortable and even wrenching .`` It 's like part of my identity got stolen , '' said Clint Murphy , a longtime Georgia Republican political adviser and consultant to candidates who left the party , in large part over Obamacare . Murphy , 38 , worked on the 2008 presidential campaign of Arizona Senator John McCain and helped Georgia 's Karen Handel run for governor in 2010 .`` I was working for Karen during the full throttle of the healthcare debate , '' Murphy said , helping to position the candidate and attending events where speakers said Obamacare was going to `` steal your doctors away . ''Then , Murphy said , his mother developed brain cancer . The family spent more than $ 100,000 on services that were not covered by the government 's Medicare program for the elderly . At the same time , Murphy applied for insurance for himself and was denied for having sleep apnea and taking anti-anxiety medication .The Affordable Care Act , he said , will provide him with a policy for between $ 245 and $ 400 per month that covers his needs .Maggie Fernandez , 37 , lost her health coverage when she was laid off from a job with Miami County earlier this year . She has started a small consulting firm but has n't been able to afford individual market insurance premiums of $ 900 per month . She stopped taking her blood pressure medication , saying it was too expensive at $ 130 for a 30-day supply .In December , she enrolled in a silver plan that costs $ 315 per month through the federal HealthCare.gov website serving 36 states , many of which are led by Republicans who refused to set up their own Obamacare marketplaces . Her medications now cost $ 4 apiece each month .Some of her conservative friends have a hard time understanding why she signed up . Fernandez said she is a pragmatist who believes that everyone should have access to health insurance .`` There 's this perception that those who are going to sign up for Obamacare are poor , that they are leeches who are just trying to get free stuff from the government , '' she said . `` I am a law-abiding citizen who pays my taxes ... pays my mortgage and opened my own business . I 'm not looking for a freebie . ''PERSONAL POLITICSIt 's far too early to know how many Republican families are signing up for coverage under Obamacare . The new health insurance marketplaces are n't inquiring about party affiliation , and outreach workers are careful not to ask when they go into communities to explain how the program works .Nationwide , just over 2 million people have picked or paid for an Obamacare health plan in the first three months of enrollment , which lasts until the end of March , according to government data . The Obama administration hopes to sign up as many as 7 million people by the time enrollment closes .A Reuters/Ipsos poll shows only a small minority of respondents who identified themselves as Republican voters favor the healthcare law , about 11 percent . Among Republican voters who are candidates for buying health insurance on the Obamacare exchanges , some 17 percent say they are likely to sign up .Their experience with the program , good or bad , is likely to temper their politics over time , an influence already seen with government programs like Medicare for the elderly and Social Security , said Robert Blendon , a health policy expert at Harvard University .If Obamacare proves positive for enough Republicans , voters may decline to support candidates who vehemently oppose the program , or split their votes in other ways .`` Your willingness to split your ballot , your willingness to write a check to somebody who thinks the bill is really awful - that is going to change , '' Blendon said . `` If the story works out differently , it could go the other way . ''Of course , many who oppose the law wo n't sign up , regardless of whether it would benefit them .`` I really do n't need it or want it right now , '' said David Petersen , 52 , a registered Republican in Walla Walla , Washington . A construction manager who has gone without insurance for years , Petersen could purchase insurance on his state 's exchange for about $ 200 a month .People who decline to purchase insurance risk a fine of $ 95 or 1 percent of their income . Knowing that , Petersen did go online and search for a plan . But he decided , in the end , that he 'd rather risk the fine .Cheryl Mooney would qualify for a subsidy that would reduce the price of a policy for herself and her husband to $ 150 per month from about $ 1,300 .But the 55-year-old , who lives in North Carolina and is `` against Obamacare absolutely , '' said she might not buy it . `` Even with that , I 'm not happy , '' Mooney said .California Assemblyman Brian Jones , a conservative Republican in San Diego County , is deeply skeptical of Obamacare , and sees the problems with the federal website as a sign of troubles still to come . But he advises constituents who need coverage to check it out .`` Somebody who does n't have health insurance , if they can get on the exchange and get coverage and they can afford it , then they should do it , '' Jones said . `` And then hope for the best .

1	"SACRAMENTO Calif. ( Reuters ) - The number of Californians without health insurance has been cut in half since the implementation of Obamacare , according to a survey published Thursday .The study by the Commonwealth Fund , a healthcare research foundation , showed that about 11 percent of adults in the most populous U.S. state were uninsured as of last month , down from 22 percent in the summer of 2013 .California was the first state to pass legislation to set up its own marketplace allowing consumers and small businesses to purchase highly regulated coverage under the Affordable Care Act , and the state has also expanded its Medicaid program , providing insurance to more low-income residents .Nationwide , the report showed , an estimated 9.5 million fewer adults between the ages of 19 and 64 were uninsured at the end of the period than at the beginning , bringing the total U.S. rate of uninsured to 15 percent from 20 percent .Among poor adults , the rates of uninsured remained highest in states that did not expand eligibility for Medicaid , the federal low-income healthcare program , the report showed .The highest rates of uninsurance were in Florida and Texas , both states that chose not to expand Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act .( Reporting by Sharon Bernstein ; Editing by Eric Walsh )"
1	"SALEM , Va.  Mitt Romneys campaign is eagerly awaiting the Supreme Courts decision on President Obamas health care law , which is expected on Thursday morning .But on Tuesday , at a machinery company here , Mr. Romney offered a preview of the possible responses he has been readying for when the ruling finally comes .If Obamacare is not deemed constitutional , then the first three-and-a-half years of this presidents term will have been wasted on something that has not helped the American people ,  Mr. Romney said . If it is deemed to stand , then Ill tell you one thing : Were going to have to have a president , and Im that one , thats going to get rid of Obamacare . Were going to stop it on Day 1.One of Mr. Romneys most reliable applause lines has been his promise to repeal what he calls Obamacare ,  and his comments Tuesday underscored the fact that the Romney team plans to use health care as a campaign issue regardless of the courts ruling .Mr. Romney also remarked on the courts decision Monday , to uphold a key provision of Arizonas controversial 2010 immigration law . Though Mr. Romney and his campaign had studiously avoided the specifics of the ruling on Monday  his traveling press secretary , Rick Gorka , went so far as to hold a seven-minute news conference that did not answer a single question  he began his remarks Tuesday by calling the situation a muddle.After criticizing Mr. Obama for failing to push through sweeping immigration reform , Mr. Romney said , The Supreme Court had to step in because states had to step in , states looking to find a way to solve the problems he didnt address , tried to address it in their own ways , and now the Supreme Courts looked at it , and what were left with is a bit of a muddle.He continued : But what we know is , the president failed to lead . He failed to do what he said hed do . And so instead of focusing on immigration , and of course on the big issue , which was the economy and getting the economy going , he instead focused on putting in place his health care reform called Obamacare.Often , as a presidential race heads into the general election battle , the campaigns find themselves engaged in a call and response over the issue of the moment . One side attacks , the other responds , and vice versa . But Tuesday was a departure from that rhythm .Mr. Romneys campaign sought to keep the focus on the news of the day  the upcoming Supreme Court ruling on health care , which is a topic Mr. Obamas team would prefer to avoid . And the Obama campaign , in contrast , returned to Mr. Romneys record as a titan of private equity , releasing a new television ad and line of attacks that portray Mr. Romney as an outsourcer-in-chief.The new line of attack  on a subject that the Romney campaign would also prefer to avoid  seeks to demonize Mr. Romneys time at Bain Capital , and pulls from a Washington Post article last week that alleges that Mr. Romneys private equity firm invested in a series of firms that relocated jobs overseas to places like India and China ."

1	"SOMERSWORTH , New Hampshire  Barack Obama and his Democratic allies in the Congress have grown more confident in recent months about their ability to use the president 's signature healthcare law as a draw rather than a liability in this November 's midterm elections .Three races in New Hampshire illustrate the challenge , offering a test of whether Democrats can overcome voter skepticism about the 2010 Affordable Care Act . The law , aiming to expand health insurance coverage to millions more Americans , has come under sustained attack from Republicans .The president has urged Democrats campaigning in the November 4 congressional elections not to run away from `` Obamacare '' , but instead to `` forcefully defend '' it . Obama has said that a surge in enrollment shows the system is running smoothly now , after its disastrous debut last October .New Hampshire , which is closely divided between Democrats and Republicans , is one of about 10 states where Republicans hope to make gains in order to pick up six seats they need to put the Democratic-led Senate under their control .Senators Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire , Kay Hagan of North Carolina and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana have been among the Democratic targets of anti-Obamacare ads by conservative groups such as Americans for Prosperity .Republicans are counting on voter antipathy toward Obamacare to try to take charge of the Senate and expand their majority in the House of Representatives . But while Obamacare may now be working better , national polls clearly show more people disapprove than approve of the law .HOPING FAMILIARITY BREEDS SUPPORTIn New Hampshire , Shaheen and Representative Carol Shea-Porter , a fellow Democrat , were among the earliest advocates of the healthcare law . The state 's other Democratic Representative , Ann Kuster , was elected after the law passed , but also backs it .Shaheen said in an interview she shared Obama 's view that as Americans get to know Obamacare , they are embracing it . Shaheen said there was `` a lot of misinformation '' about the law . `` The reality is , it 's beginning to work for people , '' she said .But 51 percent of New Hampshire adults oppose Obamacare while just 37 percent support it , the University of New Hampshire Survey Center reported last month in a WMUR-Granite State poll . Sixty-one percent of the state 's voters think medical costs will increase under the act .`` The perception is , 'it will hurt my family and costs will go up ' , '' said Andrew Smith , director of the center . `` In a political campaign , that is a big boulder to push uphill . ''Skeptics include people like Derek Gagnon , a 33-year-old auto mechanic who says he would not even consider voting for anyone who had backed the Affordable Care Act .He has no health insurance , but he also says he has no intention of signing up for the private insurance offered through the government-run website , HealthCare.gov .`` I should n't be forced to do something like that in a free country , '' said Gagnon , referring to the law 's requirement , known as the `` individual mandate , '' that almost all legal U.S. residents buy health insurance or pay a fine .`` I 'll pay the fine this year and next year , '' Gagnon said at a frozen yogurt store outside New Hampshire 's state capital , Concord . `` Maybe I wo n't have to pay it the third year , because by then Obama will be out of office . ''Gagnon 's distaste for the individual mandate dovetails with a principal line of conservative attacks nationally on the law .Obamacare is meant to extend subsidized health coverage to millions of uninsured Americans through new online private insurance markets and an expansion of the Medicaid program for the poor . But conservative critics portray it as a government intrusion in a major sector of the economy that will hurt job growth and erode freedoms .Shaheen 's leading Republican opponent in the Senate race , Scott Brown , is betting that theme will resonate in New Hampshire , where the state 's famous motto is `` Live Free or Die . ''In April , Brown kicked off his candidacy with the declaration that New Hampshire could `` Live Free or Log On '' - a caustic reference to signing up online for Obamacare .Lately , he has been traveling the state on an `` Obamacare Is n't Working '' tour . Brown , a former senator from neighboring Massachusetts , says the act should be completely repealed and the issue of healthcare reform should be left to the states .Brown has been rising in the polls against Shaheen . But she was ahead 45 to 39 percent in a recent WMUR-Granite State poll .MORE THAN HEALTHCARE AT STAKEDean Spiliotes , a New Hampshire political analyst , said Shaheen , a former New Hampshire governor , still had political capital in the state , and he doubted the healthcare issue alone could defeat her .`` People view her as not an ideologue . That has helped her with voters , '' said Spiliotes , a political science professor at Southern New Hampshire University . `` If Obamacare rises to the level of taking out Jeanne Shaheen , there is something larger going on . ''To be sure , Obamacare faces unique challenges in New Hampshire . Just one insurance company in the small state offered insurance policies through the program this year , and the insurer does n't cover healthcare in 10 of the state 's 26 hospitals , deficits Shaheen and Shea-Porter have been working to fix .Spiliotes said New Hampshire Democrats are defending Obamacare `` but they are kind of doing it in fits and starts . It 's not a uniform , rah-rah kind of support . ''In one hopeful sign for Democrats , enrollment in Obamacare in the state of 1.3 million people has reached 40,000 - double the number that had been expected .Shea-Porter , a former social worker who came to Congress in 2006 campaigning on healthcare reform , said she would never run away from healthcare reform , even though she has been critical of its implementation .`` In my mind , this was a great joy and a triumph to be able to vote for healthcare for millions of Americans who had none , '' she said . `` I am always going to support it . ''That said , she understands the political perils for Democrats of Obamacare . She lost her seat in Congress in 2010 elections after her vote for the law , only to be re-elected in 2012 . Her 2014 race is considered a toss-up although her Republican opponent has yet to be chosen in a September primary .Shea-Porter , who met last week with recent healthcare enrollees in Somersworth , said she is aware of the qualms some people have , including wariness of providing personal information on a government website .But she said the best way to advertise Obamacare 's benefits is to publicize the stories of people who signed up and discovered that `` nothing terrible happened . ''Patrice Glynn , 54-year-old New Hampshire resident , is already convinced . Glynn , a diabetic , lived without health insurance for nine months after she lost her job and before she signed up on HealthCare.gov . `` If it was so bad , would 40,000 people be on it ? '' she asked .( The story is refiled to clarify Shea-Porter position by adding full quote and criticism in paragraphs 26-27 )( Editing by Caren Bohan and Frances Kerry )"

1	"Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky hates the Affordable Care Act . So does Kentuckys senior senator , Mitch McConnell  though apparently not quite enough to stave off a primary fight . The Senate Conservatives Fund has endorsed Mr. McConnells Tea Party challenger , Matt Bevin , who charged in a television spot that McConnell helped Barack Obama and Harry Reid fund Obamacare. By that he meant that Mr. McConnell worked to end the government shutdown and raise the debt ceiling to avoid default .And yet , with this bickering in the background , Kentucky has been unusually successful in rolling out its health insurance marketplace . Dylan Scott wrote in Talking Points Memo yesterday that more than 26,000 people have enrolled in coverage , more than 50,000 have started applications and more than 300,000 unique visitors have checked out what the marketplace has to offer. Thats in a state where roughly one in six are uninsured . Kentucky , in Mr. Scotts formulation , may have built the countrys best Obamacare Website.The question is , will the disconnect between Kentuckians actual experience with the Affordable Care Act , and what their senators say about the Affordable Care Act , matter in the next election ? Could Mr. Bevins strategy backfire ?"
1	"Serving black voters , health care and economic issues were among the talking points that sparked clashes during debates Tuesday ahead of next month 's midterm elections . Highlights:___ILLINOIS : FIGHTING FOR BLACK VOTEDemocratic Gov . Pat Quinn and Republican businessman Bruce Rauner defended their records on minority hiring , public safety and gun control during a debate that focused heavily on issues impacting African-American voters .Meeting for their second televised debate , Quinn said that as governor he 's hired minorities in key administration positions  including in the post of deputy governor  but said Rauner , a venture capitalist , did n't hire African-Americans at the highest levels of his firm .`` Our cabinet is diverse and many African-Americans are heading departments , '' Quinn said .In response , Rauner said he hired minorities at his firm as did many of the hundreds of companies in which the firm invested , though he did n't answer when asked how many of them were in executive roles . The first-time candidate also said Quinn 's policies have failed blacks in Illinois , noting high unemployment among African-American men .`` Gov . Quinn is taking the African-American vote for granted , '' Rauner said . `` African-American families are suffering . ''__LOUISIANA : OBAMA 'S ROLEDemocratic Sen. Mary Landrieu framed Louisiana 's Senate election as a referendum on her three terms in office , not the policies of unpopular President Barack Obama , in the first TV debate featuring all three major contenders in the race .While the Democratic incumbent defended her vote for Obama 's federal health care overhaul , she suggested it needed improvement . She distanced herself from Obama 's energy policies and talked of her work with presidents over the years , both Republican and Democrat .`` While President Obama is not on the ballot , the future of Louisiana is , '' Landrieu said .Her main challenger , Republican Rep. Bill Cassidy , repeatedly tied Landrieu to Obama 's policies , saying a vote for her would be a vote for the president 's agenda .`` She represents Barack Obama . I represent you , '' Cassidy said .GOP candidate and tea party favorite Rob Maness positioned himself as the Washington outsider . `` Our future is in danger from poor leadership from career politicians , '' he said .___ARKANSAS : HEALTH CARE TANGLEDemocratic Sen. Mark Pryor and Republican Rep. Tom Cotton tangled over the impact of the federal health overhaul , with Pryor accusing Cotton of not having any solution for nearly 200,000 Arkansans receiving coverage under the federal law through the state 's `` private option '' Medicaid expansion if Cotton gets his wish to repeal the law .Pryor also questioned what would happen to those benefiting from other parts of the law , such as its prohibition on denying coverage for pre-existing conditions . `` He has no answer on any of this , but he is insistent on repealing it , '' Pryor said .Cotton criticized Pryor for his vote for the overhaul and said repealing it would allow for reforming the health care system and giving states control over programs such as Medicaid . `` I think we have to start over on health care reform because Obamacare is a disaster , '' Cotton said .The two also sparred over Cotton 's vote against the farm bill , with the Republican saying the practice of including food stamp funding in the measure needs to end . Pryor said the vote showed Cotton was out of touch with a state that relies heavily on agriculture .___SOUTH CAROLINA : JOB GROWTHRepublican Gov . Nikki Haley touted the more than 50,000 jobs announced by her administration while those challenging her contended those numbers were not real .Democratic state Sen. Vincent Sheheen said roughly half of the announced jobs have shown up and many of the planned openings already have fallen through . Haley countered that the promised jobs do n't happen overnight , saying `` it will take a while . ''Independent candidate Tom Ervin asked Haley to post the incentives given to lure companies to South Carolina , so taxpayers can judge whether they 're worth it . He said she had `` given away the farm when it comes to economic incentives . ''Libertarian Steve French also criticized Haley on incentives . `` I look at jobs like I look at sex , '' he said . `` You should n't brag about it if you have to pay for it . ''United Citizens candidate Morgan Bruce Reeves said the answer to the state 's economy is legalizing marijuana .___MINNESOTA : MIDDLE-CLASS CHAMPIONSDemocratic Gov . Mark Dayton and Republican challenger Jeff Johnson 's third debate was their feistiest yet , with Johnson on the offensive as he tries to make up ground in the race and the pair arguing over who is the better friend of the middle class .Johnson , a county commissioner in Minneapolis , said Dayton 's roots as privileged heir to a department store fortune mean he does n't know what it 's like to pay a mortgage or college tuition . Dayton pointed out he worked to freeze college tuition , signed a minimum-wage hike and increased school budgets . And he said Johnson would lower taxes on the rich and roll back some of the minimum wage increases .Dayton called Johnson a `` huckster '' for promising permits for copper-nickel mining on Minnesota 's Iron Range before environmental studies are complete . Johnson accused Dayton of waffling on a gas tax , or at least the exact form it would take .___UTAH : PITCHING BIPARTISANSHIPIn Utah 's 4th Congressional District race , both Democrat Doug Owens and Republican Mia Love tried to portray themselves as the candidate more likely to work across political divides if elected to the House .Owens has sought to paint Love as holding extreme views while pointing to the example set by his own father , former Democratic Rep. Wayne Owens . Love has contended that Owens has attacked her instead of the issues , saying that if more decisions were made at a local level instead of in Washington , there would be less of a partisan divide .`` When you get the decision-making close to people , you see party lines go away , '' she said .If she wins the race , Love would be the first black female Republican ever elected to Congress .___Associated Press writers Sophia Tareen and Sara Burnett in Chicago ; Melinda Deslatte in Shreveport , Louisiana ; Andrew DeMillo in Fayetteville , Arkansas ; Seanna Adcox in Columbia , South Carolina ; Brian Bakst in Duluth , Minnesota ; and Michelle Price in Salt Lake City contributed to this report ."

1	"So , are we going to have a crisis over the debt ceiling again ? Everyone seems to assume that we wont , that Republicans have learned their lesson , and that theyll huff and puff before slinking away into the shadows . But theres a problem : the GOP leadership has been telling the base to chill on the idea of shutting down the government to defund Obamacare , that theyll use the debt limit instead . And so far nobody seems to have been willing to admit that this wont work either .And part of the problem may be , once again , the complete lack of actual policy analysis on the right . Apparently Eric Cantor is floating the idea of demanding a one-year delay in Obamacare in return for not forcing America into bankruptcy ; Greg Sargent emails a Republican aide for clarification , and get this reponse:Its absolutely one of the possible outcomes of a debt limit negotiation , and likely given the Presidents proclivity for delaying sections of this law . Whether its a mandate delay , or delaying the law entirely , it depends on a great deal of other factors .OK , this represents a complete failure to understand how the health reform works . As Ive tried to explain , three things are essential : nondiscrimination , the individual mandate , and subsidies . Other things , like the employer mandate , can be delayed without undermining the basic working of the plan . But Republicans dont know any of that ; they havent tried to understand Obamacare , theyve just denounced it . And so they mistake Obamas flexibility on side issues for a willingness to retreat on the essentials , which he wont do .In other words , the wonk gap might cause the GOP to stumble into disaster ."
1	"So , very early reports are that Obamacare exchanges are , as expected , having some technical glitches on the first day  maybe even a bit worse than expected , because it appears that volume has been much bigger than predicted .Heres what you need to know : this is good , not bad , news for the program . The glitches will get fixed ; remember the calamitous rollout of Medicare Part D ? What matters is whether enough people  especially , of course , young , healthy people  actually do sign up for insurance . If they do , health reform will be a success , and will become irreversible .The big fear has been that a combination of ignorance and misinformation would keep people away , that they wouldnt sign up either because they didnt know that insurance was now available , or because Republicans had convinced them that the program was the spawn of the devil , or something . Lots of people logging on and signing up on the very first day  a day when the Kamikaze Kongress is dominating the headlines  is an early indication that its going to be fine , that plenty of people will sign up for the first year of health reform .Yes , there may be some negative news stories about the glitches . But Obamacare is not up for a revote . As Jonathan Bernstein says , the only thing that matters is whether it works . And todays heavy volume is yet another sign  along with abating health costs and below-expected premiums  that it will ."
1	"So far , nearly all of the left-of-center responses to the latest C.B.O . projections on Obamacare and workforce participation have emphasized the upside of the downward trend  the fact that what were seeing is just the end of job lock in action , which gives parents the freedom to cut their hours , near-retirees the chance to stop working a job they hate a little early , and so on down a sympathetic list . If Obamacare really does cause millions of people to voluntarily leave full-time employment ,  Matt Yglesias writes in a representative piece , that shows us how much avoidable suffering the earlier system was causing ,  and you can find roughly similar arguments from Jonathan Cohn , Jonathan Chait , and others too numerous to name .The issue that Id really like to see liberals reckon with comes from this post by Tyler Cowen , which Ill quote at length:In two papers , one of which is quite recent , and does not stem from the Heritage Foundation , [ Alan ] Krueger shows rather convincingly that the unemployed maintain reservation wages which are simply too high . They would be better off lowering those wages , being more realistic , accepting work , and getting back on their feet again . In other settings ( not considered by Krueger ) , other workers seem to be too slow to move to new areas for new jobs , given the costs of being unemployed long-term . OK , given all that , when those workers , hit by negative shocks , do not rush to go back to work at lower reservation wages , we then read a portrait of hysteresis , despair , and soul-crushing joblessness , a psychic swamp so difficult to escape that even summoning up the strength to go back to work may be difficult .In other words , would-be workers irrationally undervalue the benefits of having a job and they also underestimate the costs of remaining unemployed .Now lets switch settings . A benefit shock comes along , positive for many people , and it induces many of them to work less or not work at all . How happy should we be ? And here I mean happy at the margin , due to their change in employment decision .People , it is rather difficult to have it here both ways . I guess it is possible that workers are irrational in changing their employment decisions in response to changes in relative dollar wage opportunities , but rational when changing their employment decisions in response to changes in relative benefit opportunities . It really is possible . But are any of you actually arguing that or holding some deep-seated reason for believing in that difference , other than perhaps the reason this post might have induced you to come up with ? No , I see one assumption about a destructive choice in one context and the opposing assumption about a beneficial choice in the other context , without much regard for the tension or contradiction between those two assumptions  . A simpler possibility is that people undervalue the long-term benefits of having a job and thus in both settings the contraction in employment is a quite negative outcome . That is then very bad news for ACA , if only in expected value terms .Here is how I would frame the issue : There are specific classes of people who plainly benefit , in fairly uncomplicated ways , from benefits that provide an incentive to work less , or leave a job outright . The obvious examples are the ones that liberals keep invoking : Parents of young children ( for whom the family-friendly tax overhaul that conservative reformers like to tout would presumably have a similar effect ) , and people with a disability or chronic medical condition that makes work a simple misery .But there also lots of people who emphatically do not benefit from being given an incentive to either detach from the workforce or ( if theyre already unemployed or underemployed ) remain detached rather than taking a lower-paying job . And given the current economic landscape , especially  in which persistently high unemployment coexists with a growing population of workers too discouraged to even look for work  the size and scope of a work-discouraging effect matters a great deal : The bigger the effect , the more likely that the people dropping out arent just , say , parents cutting hours to spend more time at home while the other spouse works full time , but people we should want to be attached to the workforce , for their own long-term good and the good of the economy as well .Which is why its appropriate that the new C.B.O . projection of 2 million to 2.5 million job-equivalents disappearing has inspired more disquiet and debate than the old projection of 500,000-900,000  because its a sign , however provisional , that the costs of Obamacares workforce effects might exceed the benefits . I dont see liberals reckoning seriously with that possibility , and I think they really should ."
1	"Some commenters have asked a good question , albeit in a belligerent tone : how does the Ryan plan differ from the Affordable Care Act ? After all , in both plans people are supposed to buy coverage from private insurers , with a subsidy from the government .Well , the answer is that the ACA is specifically designed to ensure that insurance is affordable , whereas Ryancare just hands out vouchers and washes its hands . Specifically , the ACA subsidy system ( pdf ) sets a maximum percentage of income that families are expected to pay for insurance , on a sliding scale that rises with income . To the extent that the actual cost of a minimum acceptable policy exceeds that percentage of income , subsidies make up the difference .Ryancare , by contrast , provides a fixed sum  end of story . And because this fixed sum would not grow with rising health care costs , its almost guaranteed to fall far short of the actual cost of insurance .This is also why Ryancare is NOT premium support ; its a voucher system . No matter how much they say it isnt , thats exactly what it is ."
1	"Some notes for myself : how much impact have Obamas policies actually had on current and prospective inequality ?The main policies to consider are PPACA ( the health reform ) and ATRA ( the fiscal cliff deal with its associated tax rise ) .Im not a fan of the Tax Foundations work , but their analysis of the distributional effects of Obamacare looks about right : significant benefits to the bottom half of the income distribution , paid for largely by taxes on the top few percent ( the Medicare surcharge and the extra tax on investment income ) . The Tax Policy Center  whose work I do trust  has the Act reducing the after-tax income of the top 1 percent by 1.8 percent , the top 0.1 percent by 2.5 percent .Meanwhile , ATRA raises taxes relative to a continuation of the Bush high-end tax cuts : after-tax income down 4.5 percent for the 1-percenters , 6.2 percent for the top 0.1 percent .Putting this together , we have a roughly 6 percent hit to the 1 percent , around 9 to the superelite . Thats only a partial rollback of these groups huge gains since 1980 , but its not trivial ."

1	"Somehow , thinking about the ongoing struggle to fix the Obamacare bugs made me think of this:"
1	"Something really interesting is happening on the health-care front : costs are rising much less rapidly than anyone expected . This is good news for the budget ; its also good news for Obamacare . There was much skepticism about promises that health reform would bend the curve , reducing cost growth ; well , the curve is bending , and its likely that the cost control measures that are part of Obamacare ( and have been in effect for several years ) are part of the reason .One thing I havent seen mentioned much , however , is that another aspect of recent developments  the rapid rise in Medicaid enrollment , despite Republican efforts to block it  adds to the prospect of continuing good news on health costs .Medicaid gets a bad rap . Its a poor peoples program , and its widely assumed that this means poor care . In fact , theres not much evidence that this is true , and claims that Medicaid patients cant find care are greatly exaggerated . Beyond that , however , Medicaid is the piece of the US health care system ( aside from the VA ) that does the best job of controlling costs . It does this by being able to say no . For example , its able ( in a way Medicare so far cant ) to say that it wont pay for me-too drugs that are far more expensive than equally or almost equally good alternatives . This ability to say no , combined with its size , means that Medicaid covers people far more cheaply than private insurance , and probably than Medicare .One way to think about this is that Medicaid is actually the piece of the US system that looks most like European health systems , which cost far less than ours while delivering comparable results .Now , expanded Medicaid is a key part of Obamacare  and so far , despite GOP obstruction , Medicaid enrollments have outpaced insurance through the exchanges . This is often reported as if it were a bad thing  as if Medicaid were somehow a fake solution , as if only purchases of private insurance count . But Medicaid is good , very cost-effective coverage ! And rising Medicaid enrollment is , aside from a huge benefit to the previously uninsured , a step toward better cost control in the system as a whole .So liberals , dont apologize for Medicaid growth . In economic and human terms , its just what the , um , doctor ordered ."

1	"Speaking on the House floor Monday morning , Speaker John A. Boehner showed no signs of backing down in the fight over tying a delay in President Obamas signature health care law to continued financing of the government , arguing that the health care law is not ready for prime time.The House has done its work ,  he said . We passed a bill on Saturday night  sent it to the United States Senate  that would delay Obamacare for one year , and would eliminate permanently the medical device tax that is costing us tens of thousands of jobs that are being shipped overseas.Mr. Boehner criticized the Senate for not working over the weekend , a deliberate ploy by Mr. Reid to run down the clock and leave House Republicans with unpalatable options before the government shuts down at midnight : To either pass a spending bill without policy perscriptions to keep the government funded and open , or to double down on their hard-line stance and possibly be blamed for the ensuing shutdown .Senate decided not to work yesterday ,  Mr. Boehner continued . Well my goodness , if theres such an emergency , where are they ? Its time for the Senate to listen to the American people just like the House has listened to the American people and to pass a one-year delay of Obamacare and a permanent repeal of the medical device tax."
1	"Suppose that Congress decides that everyone in America should have an iPhone . There are two ways it can do this:1 ) The government could allocate money to buy all Americans iPhones .2 ) The government could require that everybody buy an iPhone but create a tax credit equivalent to the price of the phone .To an economist , these things are pretty much identical . To a politician , they are very different . The first is a big-spending government giveaway . The second is a tax cut . And in that distinction lies the heart of the firestorm around comments by one of the intellectual godfathers of President Obamas health reform law .That would be Jonathan Gruber , an M.I.T . health economist who helped design the Massachusetts health reforms on which Obamacare was based and then advised the Obama administration on that programs design . At an academic panel in 2013 , he said that this bill was written in a tortured way to make sure the Congressional Budget Office did not score the mandate as taxes. He also said that lack of transparency is a huge political advantage ,  and added , `` Call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever , but basically that was really , really critical to getting the thing to pass.It looks like a shocking instance of a onetime Obama adviser saying that the administration pulled the wool over Americas eyes in advancing major legislation . That is certainly how many conservatives are interpreting it after a video of the remarks started circulating this week .But heres the dirty little secret : Mr. Gruber was exposing something sordid yet completely commonplace about how Congress makes policy of all types : Legislators frequently game policy to fit the sometimes arbitrary conventions by which the Congressional Budget Office evaluates laws and the public debates them .In the case of the Affordable Care Act , that meant structuring the law so that the money Americans must pay the Internal Revenue Service if they fail to obtain health insurance under the laws mandate is a penalty , not a tax . ( The Supreme Court held that , though not a tax , the penalties were constitutional because they were an exercise of Congresss taxing authority , which is the kind of distinction only a lawyer could come up with ) . Thats the reason the financial assistance the health law gives people to buy insurance is structured as a tax credit , not a direct payment , which would probably be simpler and more efficient .And as Sarah Kliff notes at Vox , it is also why the law was structured to expand insurance coverage three years after passage . That way its cost estimate by the C.B.O . was kept under $ 1 trillion during the first decade after enactment . One trillion was the highest number that Democratic leaders thought was politically feasible .This kind of gamesmanship is very much a bipartisan affair . President George W. Bushs expansion of Medicare in 2003 was carefully designed so that its costs were backloaded , rising sharply just after its 10-year mark . Estimating costs in the 10-year window is an ( arbitrary ) convention for C.B.O . scoring of pending legislation . The design of the law made it seem less costly than it was expected to be over a longer time period .To economists , it doesnt matter whether our hypothetical iPhones are bought directly by the government or bought through tax cuts . It doesnt matter whether Obamacares subsidies happen through a tax credit or a check in the mail . It doesnt matter whether the costs of Bushs Medicare expansion were projected over a 10-year time horizon or 15 .In business school , they teach that there are two types of accounting . Financial accounting must follow the strict , and frequently arbitrary , rules of generally accepted accounting principles in preparing the financial statements released to investors . But a different approach , cost accounting , is for managers trying to understand the true economics of their business , such as whether a given business line is profitable . In cost accounting , the goal is less about following some set of rules to report to outsiders and more about understanding what is really in the companys best interest .Essentially , Congress is obsessed with the government equivalent of financial accounting standards ( with the C.B.O . as the rule maker ) instead of cost accounting . It structures the laws in ways that might not be very efficient but sound good on the stump . Mr. Gruber was , in an infelicitous way , expressing frustration with that state of affairs ."
1	"Suppose that healthcare.gov isnt fixed by the end of next month . How bad is it for Obamacare ? Would the program be doomed ?No , says Jonathan Cohn , because there are two layers of protection against poor signup . First , there is a system of cross-subsidies to insurance companies that was intended to prevent companies from surreptitiously gaining an advantage by only signing up healthy people ( hey , our policy is available to anyone  but you have to sign up in our sixth-floor walkup office . ) As it turns out , this system would end up compensating insurance companies in general if the risk pool is worse than expected . Second , the subsidies to individuals are designed to hold health costs down to 8 percent of income , which means that they will rise if costs are higher than expected .Neither of these would be a good thing , since they would increase the budget cost , but they do mean that Obamacares survival probably isnt on the line .Actually , the biggest reason Obama and co. should be anxious to fix these things now , Id argue , isnt the fate of the program itself , which can survive even large early wobbles , but the midterm elections . If Obamacare is fixed , Republicans will be in the position of attacking a program that is benefiting millions of Americans ; if it isnt , they can still run against the legend , not the fact .So a lot is riding on fixing the technological botch  but not in quite the way people imagine ."

1	"THE 2014 midterms have featured many variables and one constant . Whether theyre running as incumbents or challengers , campaigning in blue or red or purple states , Democratic candidates have all been dragging an anchor : a president from their party whose approval ratings havent been north of 45 percent since last October .The interesting question is why . You may recall that Mitt Romney built his entire 2012 campaign strategy around the assumption that a terrible economy would suffice to deny Barack Obama a second term . Yet throughout 2012 , with the unemployment rate still up around 8 percent , Obamas approval numbers stayed high enough ( the mid-to-upper 40s ) to ultimately win . Whereas today the unemployment rate has fallen to 6 percent , a number Team Obama would have traded David Axelrods right kidney for two years ago , but the White House hasnt benefited : The publics confidence is gone , and it doesnt seem to be coming back .So when and how was it lost ? When President Bushs second-term job approval numbers tanked , despite decent-at-the-time economic numbers , the explanation was easy : It was Iraq , Iraq , Iraq . But nothing quite so pat presents itself in Obamas case , so here are four partial theories instead .He gets blamed for Republican intransigence . This is the explanation that many Obama partisans favor , because it lets him mostly off the hook . The theory is that with the country as polarized as it is , and with the public inclined to blame the president for gridlock , the natural state for presidential approval ratings is a kind of regression toward the low 40s . This regression can be interrupted only by either some major unforeseen event or the emergence of a challenger  Romney for Obama , John Kerry for George W. Bush  who reminds voters that they dislike the other party more . But once the challenger is beaten , the process resumes : Just as Bushs post-9/11 ratings declined steadily except when Kerry was on the scene , so too Obamas numbers were doomed to decay once he won a second term .Its the economy  yes , still : This explanation raises an eyebrow at the last one and says , come on : If the economy were enjoying a 1990s-style boom , surely Obama would have a decent chance at Clinton-level approval ratings , gridlock or no gridlock ! But even with the improving employment picture this recovery is still basically a disappointment , especially for the middle class . So the contrast between Obamas position in 2012 and his weaker one today isnt necessarily a case study in the economy not mattering . Its an example of voter patience persisting for a while , and finally running out .Its Obamacare  yes , still . This is the closest equivalent to Bush and the Iraq War : The health care law is Obamas signature issue , it remains largely unpopular ( even if support for full repeal is weak ) , and its initial stumbling coincided with the sharpest second-term drop in the presidents approval . Fixing the website may have stabilized the system , but by design Obamacare still creates many losers as well as winners , and a persistent dissatisfaction with shifts in coverage and costs could be the crucial drag keeping Americans dissatisfied with their president as well .Its foreign policy  and competence . One of the interesting features of the 2012 campaign was that as much as the economy made Obamas sales pitch challenging , he had an edge that Democratic politicians often lack : The public trusted him on foreign policy . But that trust began to erode with the Edward Snowden affair , it eroded further during our non-attack on Bashar al-Assad last fall , and recent events in Ukraine and Iraq have essentially made Obamas position irrecoverable : His approval rating on foreign policy is around 35 percent in most recent polling .But this harsh judgment probably isnt explicitly ideological : The public isnt necessarily turning neoconservative or pining for the days of Bush . Instead , it mostly reflects a results-based verdict on what seems like poor execution , in which the White Houses slow response to ISIS is of a piece with the Obamacare rollout and the V.A . scandal and various other second-term asleep-at-the-tiller moments . Its a problem of leadership that reflects badly on liberalism but doesnt necessarily vindicate conservatism .And its because it isnt explicitly ideological that the Democrats still have a chance in many states on Tuesday . From North Carolina to New Hampshire to Georgia , their candidates are being tugged downward by the Obama anchor , but theyre still bobbing , still only half-submerged , waiting for undecideds to break ( or just stay home ) .In many ways , Republicans have enjoyed in 2014 the kind of landscape they expected in 2012 : a landscape in which nobody save Democratic partisans particularly supports President Obama anymore . What were about to find out is whether , amid that disillusionment , just being the not-Obama party is enough ."
1	"THE biggest health care crisis in America right now is not the inexcusably messy rollout of Obamacare .No , far more serious is the kind of catastrophe facing people like Richard Streeter , 47 , a truck driver and recreational vehicle repairman in Eugene , Ore. His problem isnt Obamacare , but a tumor in his colon that may kill him because Obamacare didnt come quite soon enough .Streeter had health insurance for decades , but beginning in 2008 his employer no longer offered it as an option . He says he tried to buy individual health insurance but , as a lifelong smoker in his late 40s , couldnt find anything affordable  so he took a terrible chance and did without .At the beginning of this year , Streeter began to notice blood in his bowel movements and discomfort in his rectum . Because he didnt have health insurance , he put off going to the doctor and reassured himself it was just irritation from sitting too many hours .I thought it was driving a truck and being on your keister all day ,  he told me . Finally , the pain became excruciating , and he went to a cut-rate clinic where a doctor , without examining him , suggested it might be hemorrhoids .By September , Streeter couldnt stand the pain any longer . He went to another doctor , who suggested a colonoscopy . The cheapest provider he could find was Dr. J. Scott Gibson , a softhearted gastroenterologist who told him that if he didnt have insurance he would do it for $ 300 down and $ 300 more whenever he had the money .Streeter made the 100-mile drive to Dr. Gibsons office in McMinnville , Ore.  and received devastating news . Dr. Gibson had found advanced colon cancer .It was heartbreaking to see the pain on his face ,  Dr. Gibson told me . It got me very angry with people who insist that Obamacare is a train wreck , when the real train wreck is what people are experiencing every day because they cant afford care.Dr. Gibson says that Streeter is the second patient he has had this year who put off getting medical attention because of lack of health insurance and now has advanced colon cancer .So , to those Republicans protesting Obamacare : Youre right that there are appalling problems with the website , but they will be fixed . Likewise , youre right that President Obama misled voters when he said that everyone could keep their insurance plan because thats now manifestly not true ( although they will be able to get new and better plans , sometimes for less money ) .But how about showing empathy also for a far larger and more desperate group : The nearly 50 million Americans without insurance who play health care Russian roulette as a result . FamiliesUSA , a health care advocacy group that supports Obamacare , estimated last year that an American dies every 20 minutes for lack of insurance .It has been a year since my college roommate , Scott Androes , died of prostate cancer , in part because he didnt have insurance and thus didnt see a doctor promptly . Scott fully acknowledged that he had made a terrible mistake in economizing on insurance , but , in a civilized country , is this a mistake that people should die from ?Website problems are a nuisance ,  Dr. Gibson said . Life and death is when you need care and cant afford to get it.The Institute of Medicine and the National Research Council this year ranked the United States health care system last or near last in several categories among 17 countries studied . The Commonwealth Fund put the United States dead last of seven industrialized countries in health care performance . And Bloomberg journalists ranked the United States health care system No . 46 in efficiency worldwide , behind Romania and Iran .The reason is simple : While some Americans get superb care , tens of millions without insurance get marginal care . Thats one reason life expectancy is relatively low in America , and child mortality is twice as high as in some European countries . Now thats a scandal .Yet about half the states are refusing to expand Medicaid to cover more uninsured people  because they dont trust Obamacare and want it to fail . The result will be more catastrophes like Streeters .I am tired of being the messenger of death ,  said Dr. Gibson . Sometimes its unavoidable . But when people come in who might have been saved if they could have afforded care early on , then to have to tell them that they have a potentially fatal illness  Im very tired of that.Streeter met with a radiologist on Thursday and is bracing for an arduous and impoverishing battle with the cancer . Theres just one bright spot : He signed up for health care insurance under Obamacare , to take effect on Jan. 1 .For him , the tragedy isnt that the Obamacare rollout has been full of glitches , but that it may have come too late to save his life ."
1	"THE first time Melissa Morelli was taken to the hospital , she was suicidal and cutting herself , her mother says . She was just 13 , and she had been transferred to a psychiatric hospital , where she stayed for more than a week . Her doctors told her mother , Cathy Morelli , that it was not safe for Melissa to go home . But the familys health insurance carrier would not continue to pay for her to remain in the hospital .The second time , the same thing happened . And the third and the fourth . Over the course of five months , Ms. Morelli took Melissa to the hospital roughly a dozen times , and each time the insurance company , Anthem Blue Cross , refused to pay for hospital care . It was just a revolving door ,  Ms. Morelli said .You had not been getting better in a significant way ,  Anthem explained in one letter sent directly to Melissa , then 14 , in July 2012. It does not seem likely that doing the same thing will help you get better.Desperate to get help for her daughter , Ms. Morelli sought the assistance of Connecticut state officials and an outside reviewer . She eventually won all her appeals , and Anthem was forced to pay for the care it initially denied . All told , Melissa spent nearly 10 months in a hospital ; she is now at home . Anthem , which would not comment on Melissas case , says its coverage decisions are based on medical evidence .Melissas treatment did not come cheap : it ultimately cost hundreds of thousands of dollars , Ms. Morelli said . Patients often find themselves at odds with health insurers , but the battles are perhaps nowhere so heated as with the treatment of serious mental illness .It was not supposed to be this way . A federal law , the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 , was aimed at avoiding fights like this over coverage by making sure insurers would cover mental illnesses just as they cover treatment for diseases like cancer or multiple sclerosis .Long a priority of Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts , it was squeezed into a bank bailout bill with the help of Christopher J. Dodd , then a Democratic senator from Connecticut , after Mr. Kennedy learned that he had brain cancer , which turned out to be fatal . The law requires larger employer-based insurance plans to cover psychiatric illnesses and substance-abuse disorders in the same way they do other illnesses .But five years after President George W. Bush signed the law , there is widespread agreement that it has fallen short of its goal of creating parity for mental health coverage .As enrollment in coverage under the Affordable Care Act becomes available on Tuesday , the rules underlying mental health coverage in general  for both private insurers and the new health care exchanges  are still unclear , mental-health patient advocates say , leaving patients and families to grind through the process as best they can .DECIDING how mental illness should be treated  and at what cost  is no easy matter . Unlike some physical ailments for which there are reams of studies suggesting a relatively clear standard of care , there is often little accepted medical evidence to support the range of treatments for many mental illnesses , like schizophrenia and severe depression .Its very different from the approach to a bypass procedure or a hip replacement ,  said Karen Ignagni , the C.E.O . of Americas Health Insurance Plans , a trade association representing the nations health insurers .At issue is not coverage for run-of-the-mill care like prescription medications for depression or a few visits with a therapist . Insurers generally cover these costs the same way they cover medications for , say , high blood pressure .But when patients need months of residential care , for example , or meetings with a therapist several times a week , insurers balk . The insurance executives say that the medical benefits of such treatments are not clear and that the industry is essentially being asked to write a blank check . Mental health accounts for a small part of total health care spending  by one estimate , $ 113 billion annually , or less than 6 percent of the $ 2.6 trillion overall health care bill . But pressure is intensifying on insurers under the Affordable Care Act , which includes mental heath care as an essential benefit , because they are already trying to keep the premiums they charge for plans on the new state marketplaces as low as possible . Insurers are concerned about the potential for new costs , while patient advocates worry that mental health will be neglected .Both sides say Washington is partly to blame . The federal government has yet to write the mental health acts final regulations for insurance companies , leaving a crucial gap between the intent of the measure and how it actually works .Senator Kennedys son , Patrick J. Kennedy , the former congressman from Rhode Island who was one of the laws main backers , said he worried that the Obama administration had delayed the rules because officials were preoccupied with the presidents broader legislation and needed the insurance companies support .President Obama needs the private insurers to implement this law or its not going to work ,  said Mr. Kennedy , who has talked openly about his struggles with depression and bipolar disorder . He has held hearings on mental health issues across the country to talk to patients and their families , including one earlier this year where Cathy Morelli spoke .Insurance companies , for their part , say they would welcome final rules under the 2008 law .We think it may create better clarity ,  said a spokeswoman for Aetna , which says it fully supports the 2008 parity law ."
1	"THE first time Obamacare seemed finished , doomed , doornail-dead , the voters of Massachusetts played the would-be executioner . In January 2010 , they sent a pickup-driving Republican to the Senate to fill Ted Kennedys seat , apparently depriving the health care bill of its crucial 60th vote and sending Democrats scrambling for a Plan B .Except that Plan B turned out to be Plan A , thanks to the maneuverings of Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi and the surprising stiffness of Democratic spines  and a bill that seemed undone by voter backlash went staggering across the legislative finish line instead .The second time Obamacare seemed headed for an early grave , it was the conservative justices on the Supreme Court who were was going to see it off , by following through on their oral-argument inclinations and finding the individual mandate unconstitutional .Except that Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. took the more politically cautious route instead  declining to overturn the mandate even though thats where his analysis seemed to point , and finding a legal via media that kept the health care law limping toward implementation .Now weve reached Obamacares third near-death experience , and if the law actually goes down this time there will be a lot of fingerprints on the murder weapon : Kathleen Sebelius and her hapless crew of Internet engineers ; the voters infuriated at being thrown from their existing coverage into the not-really-working exchanges ; panicking Congressional Democrats and gleeful Congressional Republicans ; the media , long favorably disposed to the project but now scenting second-term blood ; and of course the president himself , whose noble lie that everyone could keep their coverage has made the backlash that much worse .But the deeper force at work , the reason that these near-death experiences keep happening , isnt a website or a broken presidential promise . Its a problem inherent to contemporary liberalism , which is that liberals proudest achievement , the modern welfare state , tends to resist , corrupt and baffle their efforts at comprehensive reform .This was the message of Jonathan Rauchs book Governments End ,  which was first published in the Clinton era , and which Ive recommended before as essential to understanding liberalisms struggles in the Obama years . Because our government spends and regulates so much , Rauch argued , because its influence sprawls into so many walks of life , because so many clients and beneficiaries and interest groups depend on its programs and policies , the policy status quo is far harder to dislodge today than it was during the Progressive Era or the New Deal or the Great Society .This status quo bias is structural rather than ideological ; it frustrates limited-government conservatives as well as liberal technocrats . But the frustration has been much more acute and ironic for Democrats , who find themselves handcuffed by the very achievements they aspire to emulate , and attacked by the beneficiaries of yesterdays liberal programs when they attempt to propose programs for tomorrow .Up to a point , these are realities the Obama White House seemed to grasp , which is why theyve gotten further with health care reform than Bill Clinton did in 1993 . From a political perspective , both the complexity of Obamacares interlocking mandates , subsidies and regulations and the disingenuous promises that accompanied its passage were arguably design features rather than bugs  intended to buy off , to appease , to burden-spread and cost-conceal and generally reassure everyone just long enough to get the system up and running .But the White Houses cleverness had inevitable limits , which is why the law keeps facing backlash in fresh places , and why the media keep getting the chance to prepare Obamacare obituaries . And whats going on right now , the convergence of the websites technical problems with the backlash surrounding canceled plans , reveals the perils of trying to outsmart the political systems status quo bias . Your strategy can end up so intricate and deceptive , and your policy so complex and jerry-built , that something as basic as a malfunctioning website can suffice to bring the whole policy crashing down .The welfare states ability to defend itself against reform , however , carries a cautionary message for Obamacares critics as well . What isnt killed outright grows stronger the longer its embedded in the federal apparatus , gaining constituents and interest-group support just by virtue of its existence even if it doesnt work out the way it was designed . And as disastrous as its launch has been , if the health care law can survive this crisis in the same limping , staggering way it survived Scott Brown and the Supremes , then it will be a big step closer to being part of the status quo , with all the privileges and political strength that entails .So yes  its possible that this brush with death will be fatal , possible that the law will fall with the lightest , most politically painless push . But its still likely that Obamacare will be undone only if its critics are willing to do something more painful , and take their own turn wrestling with a system that resists any kind of change ."
1	"THE problems with our countrys political discourse are many and grave , but an insufficient attention to Obamacare isnt among them . We have talked Obamacare to death , or at least into home hospice care . The Obamacare shorthand itself reflects our need to come up with less of a mouthful than Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ,  given how regularly the topic recurs . Obamacare is like J . Lo or KFC. It saves syllables and speeds things along .So explain this : according to a recent poll , roughly 40 percent of Americans dont even know that its a law on the books .Now if I learned that 40 percent werent aware of when Obamacare was to be fully implemented or whether any of it had yet gone into practice or precisely how its likely to affect them , I wouldnt be surprised or distressed . Obamacare is nothing if not unwieldy and opaque : Ulysses meets Mulholland Drive. The people confused about it include no small number of the physicians I know and probably a few of the laws authors to boot .But 40 percent of Americans are clueless about its sheer existence . Some think its been repealed by Congress . Some think its been overturned by the Supreme Court . A few probably think its been vaporized and replaced with a galactic edict beamed down from one of Saturns moons . With Americans you never know .According to a survey I stumbled across just weeks ago , 21 percent believe that a U.F.O . landed in Roswell , N.M. , nearly seven decades ago and that the federal government hushed it up , while 14 percent believe in Bigfoot .According to another survey , taken last year , about 65 percent of us cant name a single Supreme Court justice . Not the chief one , John Roberts . Not the mute one , Clarence Thomas . Not even the mean one , Antonin Scalia . Though when it comes to Scalia , perhaps the body politic suffers less from ignorance than from repressed memory .That we Americans are out to lunch isnt news . But every once in a while a fresh factoid like the Obamacare ignorance comes along to remind us that were out to breakfast and dinner as well . And it adds an important , infrequently acknowledged bit of perspective to all the commentary , from us journalists and from political strategists alike , about how voters behave and whom they reward . We purport to interpret an informed , rational universe , because wed undercut our own insights if we purported anything else .But only limited sense can be made of what is often nonsensical , and the truth is that a great big chunk of the electorate is tuned out , zonked out or combing Roswell for alien remains . Polls over the last few years have variously shown that about 30 percent of us couldnt name the vice president , about 35 percent couldnt assign the proper century to the American Revolution and 6 percent couldnt circle Independence Day on a calendar . Im supposing that the 6 percent werent also given the holidays synonym , the Fourth of July . Im an optimist through and through .Heres one of my favorite findings : in a poll in 2011 , after intense , closely chronicled fiscal battles in California , a sampling of the states residents were quizzed about which category of spending accounted for the biggest share of Californias budget . Only 16 percent correctly said public education through the 12th grade . And they did this poorly in spite of being given just four possible answers , including the correct one , from which to choose . They more or less underperformed the odds .Apart from perennial news stories about how many Americans would flunk the citizenship test that immigrants must pass , we mostly gloss over our ignorance or deny it . Election analysts are constantly saying that voters are too smart for some ploy or smarter than they get credit for being .And theres a whole subgenre of nonfiction that assures us that we shouldnt be spooked by how uneducated we are . The Wisdom of Crowds suggests that if enough bumbling people act in concert , theyll find their way to a less bumbling place , while Blink portrays snap judgments as the fruits of an information intake that isnt easily measured but is meaningful nonetheless . Theres Emotional Intelligence as well as nuts-and-bolts knowledge , and we can be guided , profitably , by it .I buy some of that . Ive talked to enough voters over enough elections to recognize that their flabby impressions arent always antonyms of concrete information but instead cruder , lesser versions of it , colored if not governed by facts that theyve picked up in a peripheral , semiconscious fashion .Still . In 2010 in California , I covered a Tea Party rally at which Carly Fiorina , vying for the Republican nomination for a United States Senate seat , was scheduled to speak . I approached a couple whose profusion of hats and buttons and handmade signs  along with their willingness to spend hours in a crowded field under a punishing sun  led me to believe that they were at least somewhat politically engaged . I asked them if they were inclined to support Fiorina . With great seriousness , they said that they hadnt yet decided between her and Meg Whitman . Whitman was running not for senator but for governor , in a race that hardly wanted for coverage . They didnt have to choose .At a heated point of the 2012 presidential primaries , when both Rick Santorum and the news media were making much of his faith and fecundity , less than 30 percent of voters could identify his religious affiliation as Catholic , according to one poll. Months later a different poll asked adults about President Obamas religious affiliation , persistently mistaken by some Americans to be Muslim . Lamentably , 18 percent still thought Mr. Obama was Muslim  pretty much unchanged from the 17 percent who thought he was Muslim when the same poll asked the question two years earlier .Its possible , of course , that respondents just mess with pollsters heads . Hes a Seventh-day Adventist ! Hes a Scientologist ! But too many surveys over too many years show too much abject ignorance for the phenomenon to be belittled or dismissed . Whats more , theres no consoling arc over time , no trajectory of progress . Wherever the Internet is speeding us , its not toward greater civic erudition and enlightenment .Into the vacuum of substantive knowledge rush the unprincipled advertisements , the unctuous hucksters , the super PACs ,  the Swift boating , the Sunday-morning-talk-show spin . A clueless electorate is a corruptible one , and one that seems ill poised to make the smartest , best call about something as sweeping as Obamacare and how it gets tweaked or not down the line . Maybe well blink our way to the right decisions . Or maybe well just stumble around with our eyes closed ."

1	"THIS was the week when liberals decided that it was safe to feel optimistic about Obamacare again .Not , mind you , because the websites flaws have all been wiped away , or because the pace of enrollment is where the White House wanted it to be , or because the political backlash over plan cancellations has disappeared . The site may be better , the enrollment pace higher , the backlash no longer front-page news  but the laws rollout is by any reasonable definition still a dreadful mess .But a worst-case scenario , in which the website remained unusable well into the new year , seems to have been averted , and with it the danger that insurers or Congressional Democrats would begin to bail on Obamacare entirely .And liberals have apparently decided that just getting things moving in the right direction makes all the difference . Sure , problems persist , crucial errors remain , and confusion probably looms for some customers and insurers in January , when policies are supposed to take effect . But errors can be fixed , money sluiced around , more temporary changes made . The important thing is there will be no immediate political unraveling ... which means that enrollment will keep rising ... which means that by 2016 , Obamacare will be a locked-in , impossible-to-repeal feature of the American landscape .This holds true , liberals have begun telling themselves , even if the laws disruptions cost Democrats dearly in the 2014 midterms . Because a working website will give the White House three full years to create millions , and perhaps tens of millions , of winners who are getting insurance or protection ,  The Washington Posts Ezra Klein wrote last week , Democrats can lose on the politics in the midterm election even as they win on the policy in the long term.The entrenchment hypothesis is plausible . But it elides one crucial problem : the extent to which the successful implementation of Obamacare actually depends on the laws political standing.Thats because the law can work only if people who dont necessarily benefit immediately from its provisions decide to participate anyway . If they respond to higher premiums by either staying out or dropping out , then Obamacare will be permanently unstable : the dollar figures , both for insurers and the government , simply wont add up .The participation of the young and healthy is supposed to be required , of course , by the individual mandate . But the mandates penalty is relatively modest and its enforcement mechanisms relatively weak , which means its power ultimately depends more on civic duty than on immediate self-interest .The laws advocates have explicitly acknowledged this point . Explaining the case for the mandate last month , The Atlantics Matt OBrien allowed that a rational self-maximizer might decide to pay the fine instead of buying costly coverage . But real people ,  he argued , arent rational self-maximizers ... We dont like to feel like were doing the wrong thing . We like to follow the rules instead . Feel like were a good person.The experience of Mitt Romneys Massachusetts , OBrien concluded , shows how this works : enrollment in Romneycare spiked when the mandate kicked in , and it spiked for healthy people  presumably because they accepted the positive responsibility of the mandate , and bought health insurance because its what they were supposed to do.But this example does not necessarily bode well for Obamacares unfolding . The Massachusetts law was a bipartisan bill passed in a wealthy , homogeneous state with a pervasive left-liberal ethos . The national health care law aspires to create the same sense of positive responsibility in a much more polarized , fragmented , socioeconomically diverse and libertarian-minded society , roughly half of which opposes the law outright .This was always going to be a lift even without technological problems and if you like your plan , you can keep your plan disillusionment . Now its much , much heavier .Consider the findings of a new poll from Harvards Institute of Politics . Among the traditionally pro-Obama millennial generation , the core group that the White House needs to follow the rules and buy a policy , the presidents approval ratings have dropped to 41 percent , and support for Obamacare has also plunged : 56 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds disapprove of the law , a majority say it will increase costs , and just 18 percent say it will improve their care . Meanwhile , a new National Journal survey finds that a majority of millennials expect the law to be repealed outright .Those are not numbers that suggest a population thats poised to fall in line , do its civic duty , and feel warm and fuzzy in the process . Rather , they suggest that the political emotions stirred up by the rollout  frustration , disillusionment , anger  could have substantial consequences for sign-up rates as well .If theres one thing we know how to do ,  said a White House official last spring , projecting optimism about Obamacare enrollment , its reach young people.Now , though , the fate of their policy may depend on not only reaching them , but reconverting them as well ."

After all , we have just come through a 16-day shutdown of government and a near-default because of the Republican Partys continued opposition to Obamacare . While many of that partys elected officials have acknowledged that this is not the time to defund or eliminate Obamacare , who among them has acknowledged the need for its continued existence ?

1	"TORONTO  Canadian computer services provider CGI Group Inc , the contractor behind the troubled Obamacare enrollment website , reported weaker-than-expected quarterly results on Wednesday , sending its shares to a four-month low .The Montreal-based company said revenue and bookings - an indicator of future sales - were both strong in its first quarter despite losing the contract to manage the U.S. federal healthcare enrollment website it helped build .But it also reported U.S. margin pressure and said cash from operations slipped to C $ 66 million ( $ 59.19 million ) , down from C $ 224.5 million a year earlier . It blamed delays in collecting payments on some contracts as well as a hit from payments related to the integration of former British competitor Logica , which it bought more than a year ago to expand its European presence .The company said it expects both of those problems to be temporary and predicted cash generation of around C $ 300 million per quarter in coming quarters . CGI said it generated more than C $ 800 million in cash from operations over the previous 12 months , excluding Logica integration costs .It also said that revenue - which would have shrunk if not for advantageous currency rates - was pressured by a deliberate move away from low-margin business , and that costs in the United States rose as it pushed to hit year-end targets .The stock was down 4 percent at C $ 33.81 on the Toronto Stock Exchange at midmorning on Wednesday after falling as low as C $ 32.71 , its lowest point since early September .`` All things considered I see this is a buying opportunity and I 'm still positive on the stock , '' said Thanos Moschopoulos , an analyst at BMO Capital Markets .`` But I 'd say the quarter was mixed because I liked the bookings , I liked the revenue performance , I liked management 's tone on the call , but it does seem that EPS ( earnings per share ) estimates for the Street are likely to come down a little . ''CGI has attracted the attention of short-seller Jim Chanos , who warned last month the company 's high-profile troubles could hurt its ability to win government contracts and said the Logica acquisition hid deteriorating fundamentals .PLAGUED BY ERROR MESSAGESThe U.S. healthcare.gov site was plagued by error messages and slow speeds for weeks after its launch , creating a political headache for the White House .The U.S. government said earlier this month that Accenture had been chosen to replace CGI Federal as lead contractor for the Obamacare enrollment website .`` ( We ) have not seen any impact on our ability to conduct or grow our business '' from the website 's problems , CGI CEO Michael Roach told investors and analysts on a conference call .He said the company is still involved in managing six state-based health exchanges , with some performing better than others .CGI still managed to increase its backlog of orders in the quarter and announced a plan that gives it the option to buy back up to 10 percent of its shares in the next year .The company said it booked C $ 2.8 billion worth of contracts in the quarter , almost half of it new business , for a book-to-bill ratio of 107 percent .Book-to-bill refers to the ratio of orders added to the company 's backlog versus finished work that can be billed to a client . Investors are keen to see the company get orders for more work than it finishes each quarter , as this points to growth .CGI 's backlog of signed orders rose by C $ 972 million to stand at C $ 19.3 billion at the end of December .One-third of the bookings were for government customers , with almost a quarter for manufacturers , retailers and distributors , the company said . More than a quarter came from the United States , but a broad range of geographies were represented .The company had a net profit of C $ 189.8 million , or 60 Canadian cents a share . It said revenue rose 4.4 percent to C $ 2.64 billion .Excluding Logica integration costs , CGI said it made C $ 207.9 million , or 65 Canadian cents a share , compared with C $ 137.8 million , or 44 cents a share , a year earlier .Analysts had on average had expected CGI to earn 70 Canadian cents a share on revenue of C $ 2.64 billion , according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S .( $ 1= $ 1.11 Canadian )( Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe , Chizu Nomiyama , Jeffrey Hodgson and Peter Galloway )"
1	"TWO beliefs continue to shape debate on Obamacare . First , pre-existing medical conditions shouldnt prevent people from obtaining affordable health insurance . And second , people who dont want health insurance shouldnt be forced by the government to purchase it .These may seem to be reasonable positions . But they are incompatible . Thats been shown by historical events , and its now being strikingly confirmed by recent experience in the emerging Obamacare insurance exchanges .The crux of the matter is what economists call the adverse-selection problem . Uninsured people with pre-existing conditions often face tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket medical costs annually . If insurers charged everyone the same rate , buying coverage would be far more attractive financially for people with chronic illnesses than for healthy people . And as healthy policyholders began dropping out of the insured pool , it would become increasingly composed of sick people , forcing insurers to raise their rates .But higher rates make insurance even less attractive for healthy people , causing even more of them to drop out . Before long , coverage would become too expensive for almost everyone .The adverse-selection problem explains why almost no countries leave health care provision to unregulated private insurance markets . It also predicts that requiring private insurance companies to charge the same rates to everyone will make it prohibitively expensive for most people to buy individual health insurance .In the 1990s , lawmakers in New York State enacted just such a requirement , and the result was exactly as predicted . Rates for individual policies soared , making New Yorkers insurance among the most expensive in the nation . Now , rates quoted under the Obamacare exchanges place individual policies within reach for millions of New Yorkers . New York City residents who had been paying $ 1,000 a month for individual policies in the earlier environment , for example , will now be able to purchase similar coverage on the Obamacare exchanges for slightly more than $ 300 a month .Whats changed ? Insurers are able to offer more reasonable rates because the individual mandate  the requirement in Obamacare that everyone buy insurance or face financial penalties  is ensuring a high proportion of healthy people in the insured pool .Early quotes for individual policies on the exchanges in several other states have exhibited a similar pattern . Thats true in California , for example , and in Maryland , the latest state to report , rates now compare favorably with those in employer group plans .Despite this experience , many in Congress want to repeal the individual mandate . Some , such as Senator Marco Rubio of Florida , have even threatened to shut down the government unless Obamacare is repealed entirely .What alternatives are there ? One way of avoiding the adverse-selection problem would be to re-emphasize traditional employer-provided health plans . Adverse selection is less serious under such plans , because the favorable tax treatment they receive requires insurers to cover all employees irrespective of pre-existing conditions . ( Insurers can meet the requirement because most people employed in any company are reasonably healthy . )But Obamacare was enacted precisely because employer plans fell short in many other ways . Millions of people , for example , are ineligible for such plans because they dont have jobs . And millions of others with chronic health problems are trapped in their current jobs , because leaving them would mean losing coverage .Employer plans arose in the first place only because of a loophole created by wage controls during World War II . In an effort to curb the costs of the war effort , the government prohibited wage increases but , perhaps by oversight , did not prevent employers from offering additional fringe benefits as a way to combat labor shortages . Employer health plans proved an especially effective recruiting tool and had the additional advantage of not being taxed as implicit income .BUT if universal access to health care is the goal , employer plans are not the solution . Because global competition has increased pressure to cut costs , the number of workers with such plans has been steadily declining for more than 40 years .The challenge was to design a new system that could cover the more than 50 million Americans without health insurance . The Medicare-for-all proposal favored by many health economists was one approach that the administration considered .But that approach would have required Americans to abandon their existing employer plans for something new and unfamiliar . In the light of survey evidence that most Americans were reasonably satisfied with their existing plans , its hard to second-guess President Obamas conclusion that this step would have been politically infeasible .The only remaining option was to supplement existing employer plans with regulated private insurance markets . This approach had been carried out successfully in Switzerland , and in Massachusetts under Mitt Romney when he was governor . Individual mandates were an essential ingredient of that strategy . And given that many people could not afford to purchase insurance , it was also necessary to include subsidies for low-income buyers .Obamacare , in any event , is now the law of the land . Even its most ardent supporters concede that the program will need to be amended as experience accumulates . But evidence from the emerging insurance exchanges vindicates the basic policy choices underlying the legislation .We must ask those who would repeal Obamacare how they propose to solve the adverse-selection problem . That problem is not an abstraction invented by economists to justify trampling individual liberties . As experience in most countries around the world has confirmed , it is a profound source of market failure that renders unregulated insurance markets a catastrophically ineffective way of providing access to health care ."

1	"The Affordable Care Act , a k a Obamacare , goes fully into effect at the beginning of next year , and predictions of disaster are being heard far and wide . There will be an administrative train wreck ,  were told ; consumers will face a terrible shock . Republicans , one hears , are already counting on the laws troubles to give them a big electoral advantage .No doubt there will be problems , as there are with any large new government initiative , and in this case , we have the added complication that many Republican governors and legislators are doing all they can to sabotage reform . Yet important new evidence  especially from California , the laws most important test case  suggests that the real Obamacare shock will be one of unexpected success .Before I can explain what the news means , I need to make a crucial point : Obamacare is a deeply conservative reform , not in a political sense ( although it was originally a Republican proposal ) but in terms of leaving most peoples health care unaffected . Americans who receive health insurance from their employers , Medicare or Medicaid  which is to say , the vast majority of those who have any kind of health insurance at all  will see almost no changes when the law goes into effect .There are , however , millions of Americans who dont receive insurance either from their employers or from government programs . They can get insurance only by buying it on their own , and many of them are effectively shut out of that market . In some states , like California , insurers reject applicants with past medical problems . In others , like New York , insurers cant reject applicants , and must offer similar coverage regardless of personal medical history ( community rating ) ; unfortunately , this leads to a situation in which premiums are very high because only those with current health problems sign up , while healthy people take the risk of going uninsured .Obamacare closes this gap with a three-part approach . First , community rating everywhere  no more exclusion based on pre-existing conditions . Second , the mandate  you must buy insurance even if youre currently healthy . Third , subsidies to make insurance affordable for those with lower incomes .Massachusetts has had essentially this system since 2006 ; as a result , nearly all residents have health insurance , and the program remains very popular . So we know that Obamacare  or , as some of us call it , ObamaRomneyCare  can work .Skeptics argued , however , that Massachusetts was special : it had relatively few uninsured residents even before the reform , and it already had community rating . What would happen elsewhere ? In particular , what would happen in California , where more than a fifth of the nonelderly population is uninsured , and the individual insurance market is largely unregulated ? Would there be sticker shock as the price of individual policies soared ?Well , the California bids are in  that is , insurers have submitted the prices at which they are willing to offer coverage on the states newly created Obamacare exchange . And the prices , it turns out , are surprisingly low . A handful of healthy people may find themselves paying more for coverage , but it looks as if Obamacares first year in California is going to be an overwhelmingly positive experience .What can still go wrong ? Well , Obamacare is a complicated program , basically because simpler options , like Medicare for all , werent considered politically feasible . So there will probably be a lot of administrative confusion as the law goes into effect , again especially in states where Republicans have been doing their best to sabotage the process .Also , some people are too poor to afford coverage even with the subsidies . These Americans were supposed to be covered by a federally financed expansion of Medicaid , but in states where Republicans have blocked Medicaid expansion , such unfortunates will be left out in the cold .Still , heres what it seems is about to happen : millions of Americans will suddenly gain health coverage , and millions more will feel much more secure knowing that such coverage is available if they lose their jobs or suffer other misfortunes . Only a relative handful of people will be hurt at all . And as contrasts emerge between the experience of states like California that are making the most of the new policy and that of states like Texas whose politicians are doing their best to undermine it , the sheer meanspiritedness of the Obamacare opponents will become ever more obvious .So yes , it does look as if theres an Obamacare shock coming : the shock of learning that a public program designed to help a lot of people can , strange to say , end up helping a lot of people  especially when government officials actually try to make it work ."
1	"The Affordable Care Act , aka Obamacare , is a policy Rube Goldberg device  instead of doing the simple , obvious thing , which would just be to insure everyone , it basically relies on a combination of regulations and subsidies to rope , coddle , and nudge us into a rough approximation of a single-payer system . There were reasons for this , of course , mainly political : a complete displacement of the existing system would have been both too destructive of powerful interests and too radical for voters .Still , the question is whether this cobbled-together system will work , and there have been many conservatives rubbing their hands with glee over the prospect of failure .Whoops .We wont really know how Obamacare works until it has been in operation for a while ; but we do know that essentially the same system has been running in Massachusetts since 2006 , and is doing pretty well . The question , then , is whether other states that dont have MAs initial advantages  especially an already low uninsurance rate and an already operating system of community rating  can make this thing work . The big fear has been of sharply rising premiums as insurers are required to cover people with preexisting conditions . And the biggest test case was always going to be California .Well , the preliminary numbers for CA are in  and theyre looking very good , with costs coming in below expectations . At this point , it looks as if this thing is indeed going to work .And think about the political dynamics . Because the Supreme Court decided to let states opt out of the Medicaid expansion , some states  notably Texas  will have a pretty dysfunctional version of Obamacare in 2014 , although even those systems will provide significant benefits to many people . Still , the whole political calculus was supposed to be that Republicans in red states could point to the horrors of Obamacare and ride them to political victory . Instead , it looks as if were going to see blue-state residents reaping the benefits of a functional health care system , while red-state residents are denied many of those benefits , for what looks like no better reason than mean-spirited spite  because whats going on is , indeed , mean-spirited spite .Predictions that Obamacare will be a big political issue are probably right  but not in the way gleeful conservatives imagined ."
-1	"A large majority of Americans say they like the insurance coverage they obtained through government exchanges , which were set up by the Affordable Care Act .Via PoliticoWith the second round of Obamacare enrollment set to begin on Saturday , 71 percent said their coverage through the exchanges was good or excellent , according to a Gallup poll released Friday . Another 19 percent said the coverage was fair , while 9 percent rated it poorly .The pollster notes that these marks are comparable to all who have health insurance . However , those newly insured through the exchanges are more satisfied with the cost of health care  with 75 percent saying so  versus 61 percent of all insured respondents who said they were satisfied with the cost of health care ."
-1	"Ezra Klein directs us to the latest from the Kaiser Family Foundation , which asks what the average Obamacare 2015 premium increase will be for those places for which we have full information  and finds that premiums will actually decline slightly . Ezra tries to get us to appreciate just how good the Obamacare news has been with a thought experiment:Imagine taking a time machine back to 2010 and telling Republicans in Congress , who were arguing that the CBO was wildly underestimating Obamacares cost , that the law would be cheaper than predicted and , at least in the states that accepted its Medicaid dollars , cover more people than the Congressional Budget Office thought . After the laughing and mocking and the calling of security , lets say you offered this prediction in the form a of a bet . What odds do you think Obamacares critics would have offered ? 2:1 ? 5:1 ? 10:1 ?But you dont have to go back to 2010 . Look at John Cochrane in late 2013 , taking it for granted that Obamacare would implode in a death spiral within a few months . Look at The Hill just four months ago , telling us that double-digit premium hikes were coming .One question we might ask here is , why is the news so good ? The answer , Id suggest  although I hope the real experts will weigh in  is that were actually seeing the opposite of a death spiral ; call it a life spiral . For one thing , the huge surge in enrollments late in the day meant that the risk pool this year is better than insurers expected , and they now expect 2015 to be better still . Also , importantly , big enrollments mean that more insurers are entering the market , increasing competition . And , of course , the better the deal the more people will sign up : success feeds success .Another question we might ask : Is our conservatives learning ? Are those who bought into the death spiral stories , who seized on every hint of bad news , asking themselves how they got it so wrong ? Are they , maybe , considering the possibility that theyre listening to the wrong people , that maybe Jon Gruber knows what hes talking about and John Goodman is a hack ?Hahahaha ."
-1	"SO far , opponents of the Affordable Care Act have lost every major battle to repeal or invalidate it . Some of them are now urging the courts to interpret the health reform law in a way that would guarantee its failure . This is a significant threat  potentially as grave as the previous main legal challenge to the law , which the Supreme Court rejected , 5 to 4 , in 2012 . If the new effort succeeds , it would create total chaos .Having failed to undo the individual mandate to buy health insurance , opponents now claim that , under the law , subsidies for low- and moderate-income Americans to buy insurance may be paid only in those states  currently 14  that have set up their own online insurance exchanges . This would torpedo a central goal of the law : the expansion of coverage .At first , those of us who support Obamacare thought these claims were a joke . On July 22 , the federal appellate court in Richmond , Va. , rejected one such claim , but the same day , astonishingly , the federal appellate court for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled , 2 to 1 , in favor of the plaintiff in a similar case , Halbig v. Burwell . Similar challenges are working their way through courts in two other circuits .Last Thursday , the entire United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit put aside that 2-1 ruling , agreeing to hear the case en banc on Dec. 17 . But now the opponents of Obamacare are asking the Supreme Court to immediately hear an appeal of the Richmond decision , and to pre-empt the full District of Columbia court from hearing the case .The legal challenges say that a provision in the law that references the payment of credits to people who enroll through an Exchange that is established by a State means that credits are not available in the 36 states that have decided to have the federal government manage their exchanges for them .We are economists , not lawyers . But we note that the statute , while vague at points , confirms , when read in its entirety , that tax credits are to be available on all the exchanges , nationwide . The law specifically instructed the secretary of health and human services to create and manage the exchanges for states that chose that option . And when the law was passed , everyone involved in the laws passage understood that this directive vested federal exchanges with the same mission and authority as state-mandated exchanges .The expansion of coverage rests on interlocking elements . The law bars insurers from denying coverage to people with pre-existing medical conditions , dropping coverage when people develop costly illnesses , and charging discriminatory premiums . By themselves , these provisions would encourage people to delay buying insurance until they became ill , causing premiums to skyrocket . So to keep premiums affordable , the law requires nearly everyone to buy insurance , and offers low- and moderate-income people financial help  in the form of refundable tax credits . If both the sick and the healthy buy insurance , premiums can be kept within reason .Limiting tax credits to the 14 states that manage their own exchanges ( along with the District of Columbia ) would destroy this careful architecture . Over five million people receive coverage through federal exchanges  two-thirds of all those covered through exchanges and 40 percent of those newly insured by the act . The best estimates suggest that out-of-pocket costs to typical enrollees of the least-expensive plans available in federally facilitated exchanges would soar to 23 percent of household income , from 3 percent  and to 28 percent of income , from 6 percent , for those in the second least-expensive plans . Households would lose about $ 36 billion in tax credits that help make insurance affordable . Some 6.5 million fewer people would be insured . The federal exchanges could collapse , because they would be left with sick patients , saddled with costly premiums .The record is unambiguous : Congress , in 2010 , understood and endorsed the links connecting the sale of insurance , the requirement to carry insurance and the financial aid to make it affordable . Opponents who lost in the democratic process are now seeking to vitiate the law through a perverse reading of it .If the full District of Columbia Circuit takes up the case , it should reject this sophistry . Meanwhile , the Supreme Court should wait to see what the lower courts do before deciding whether to intervene . Whatever one thinks of the Affordable Care Act , it is absurd to argue that its drafters intended to make insurance unaffordable ."
-1	"On Thursday morning , as almost everyone predicted it would , the federal appeals court in Washington , D.C. , voted to toss out a three-judge panels ruling upholding the latest attempt to kill Obamacare. The full 11-member court is scheduled to rehear the case on Dec. 17 .The claim this time was that subsidies for the health exchanges that are at the heart of the law are available only to those exchanges established by the State. In other words , not available in the three dozen states where the federal government has set up an exchange because the state refused to . This would result in the denial of coverage to an estimated 4.7 million Americans . To succeed , the claim required that those four words be considered in a hermetically sealed tube , independent from the rest of the 900-page law , whose core purpose was to ensure affordable health-care to lower-income Americans .Luckily for the challengers , two of the three panel judges in the case , Halbig v. Burwell , were sympathetic to that way of reading the law . The third was less impressed , calling it a not-so-veiled attempt to gut the Affordable Care Act .The rehearing will occur before a court with a majority of judges appointed by Democratic presidents . For that reason , many predict that the court will side with the government and reject the challengers claim .This matters because the challengers desperately wanted to pole-vault over the D.C. appeals court and go straight to the Supreme Court  where they believe they have their best shot at winning once and for all . Its the high-stakes version of what lawyers call forum-shopping  each side maneuvering to get a case into the court where they feel their chances are best .While its generally wise to avoid gaming out judges votes based simply on the party of their appointing president , in the Halbig case , that has been a reliable proxy .Of course , a key reason for the current makeup of the D.C. appeals court is the Senates reform of the filibuster process last fall , which was triggered by Republicans refusal to allow a vote on any of President Obamas three nominees to that court . After the reform , all three nominees were confirmed .If anyone was wondering what the hue and cry over filibuster reform was really about in practice , the Halbig case is Exhibit A ."
-1	"It looks as though Republicans are no longer betting on the Affordable Care Act as a surefire political weapon . The Upshot reported on Wednesday that , in the summer of 2013 , lawmakers churned out 530 news releases using the term Obamacare. So far this summer , in advance of the mid-terms when one might expect that number to go up , its fallen dramatically , to 138 so far .In addition to this sign of waning interest , Bloomberg reported last Tuesday that Republicans in competitive Senate races are easing off their strategy of criticizing Democrats over the Affordable Care Act. Heres the situation in North Carolina , according to Bloomberg , where Democratic Senator Kay Hagan is in a statistical tie with her Republican challenger , Thom Tillis:In April , anti-Obamacare advertising dwarfed all other spots in North Carolina . It accounted for 3,061 , or 54 percent , of the 5,704 top five issue ads in North Carolina , according to Kantar Medias Campaign Media Analysis Group . By July , the numbers had reversed , with anti-Obamacare ads accounting for 971 , or 27 percent , of the top issue ads , and the budget , government spending , jobs and unemployment accounting for 2,608 , or 72 percent , of such ads , CMAG data show .Republicans of course havent embraced the Affordable Care Act . Now that its actually gone into effect , though , they seem to be slowly coming around the reality that its not at all the disaster they assumed it would be , and therefore may not draw voters to the polls ."
-1	"In my post yesterday on potential metrics for assessing Obamacares claim to be a policy success , I didnt directly address the laws eventual impact on the deficit . So Im grateful to Jonathan Chait for raising the issue , in the course of a post explaining why the Obamacare debate proves ( yet again , he would say ) that liberals are more empirical and data-driven than conservatives . Noting that many Republicans had alleged that the laws promise of deficit reduction was based ( in Paul Ryans words ) on gimmicks and smoke and mirrors ,  Chait cites a new C.B.O . estimate on the cost of the laws coverage expansion and announces that reality has spoken , and the case is closed:There will never be a single dramatic moment that will shatter the rights inbred health-care falsehoods the way the election , in a single night , discredited the poll-unskewers . But the Congressional Budget Offices update on Obamacare issued last week is the latest and most powerful repudiation of the case Ryan and his allies made . It reiterates that , contrary to the rights certainty that the apparent deficit-reducing measures would melt away as the program went online , it still reduces the deficit . Indeed , it turns out to be even more fiscally conservative than originally forecast . Every new forecast turns out to be more optimistic than the last .In fact , this is not exactly what the update says : Its focused exclusively on the cost of the coverage expansion , which means that it doesnt address the offsets ( sharp cuts to Medicare , in particular ) that Republicans had in mind when they accused the White House of relying on promises of future belt-tightening that will never actually be imposed . The update does reference a two-year-old projection which found that these offsets , if duly enacted , would reduce the deficit , but then it pleads agnosticism as to the current situation , writing that CBO  can no longer determine exactly how the provisions of the ACA that are not related to the expansion of health insurance coverage have affected their projections of direct spending and revenues  isolating the incremental effects of those provisions on previously existing programs and revenues four years after enactment of the ACA is not possible.So the report doesnt tell us anything , and doesnt claim to tell us anything , about whether all the promised Medicare cuts are actually happening ( spoiler : they arent ) , let alone whether they or any other revenue-raising provisions ( the Cadillac tax on high-value plans , the employer mandate ) are likely to be fully implemented in the future , or whether already-implemented and unpopular measures like the medical device tax could end up being repealed , or  well , you get the idea . Which means that by definition , the update isnt proof that the law is even more fiscally conservative than originally forecast ,  because that simply isnt a question it sets out to answer .This doesnt mean , though , that we cant make an educated guess about the fiscal picture , and mine is that whats happened to date is mostly a wash : The projected cost of coverage has gone down , as Chait says , mostly because health care inflation has been well below expectations and because Obamacare is covering fewer people than originally hoped , and the Obama White House has used those savings as a reason to postpone some unpleasant-to-implement provisions  delaying Medicare Advantage cuts , weakening IPABs mandate , delaying the employer mandate , etc .This interconnectedness of coverage , cost inflation and deficits is part why I didnt include the deficit in my prior list of standards for success  because its entangled , in different ways , with the standards I did list . If enrollment ends up well below expectations , for instance , the fiscal cost of the program will be much more manageable  but its not clear , given the laws coverage-expanding objectives , that this would actually count as true good news . Alternatively , if cost inflation stays low , then the fiscal issues will likewise diminish in a way thats much more uncomplicatedly positive . But then in a scenario where inflation picks up again and enrollment heads back toward the levels that the laws architects expected , the problem of actually cutting Medicare will loom larger , and the promised-but-postponed offsets will have to actually be pursued . At which point well actually find out if the G.O.P . was right to dismiss them all as smoke and mirrors  but until then , the question is still open .The deeper debate here , though , is one that cant necessarily be decisively adjudicated by even the most data-driven umpire , for reasons suggested by the C.B.O.s point about the difficulty of isolating the effect of Obamacare on existing policies and programs . Here I mean that its entirely possible that the new health care law will end up being technically revenue neutral while also having a sweepingly negative impact on Americas fiscal picture overall  because its mix of cuts and tax hikes , if fully enacted , could drastically limit future policymakers options when the time comes to make further cuts or raise taxes to pay for Medicare and Social Security . ( This is part of what conservatives mean when they accuse the Obama White House of double counting and gimmickry and the like  theyre saying that if you make cuts to an insolvent-in-the-long-run program to pay for a new program , youre engaged in something other than fiscal conservatism ,  because you havent actually addressed your original insolvency problem . )Again , maybe  hopefully  a permanent slowdown in health care costs makes a lot of this problem go away . But its quite possible that well end up , 10 or 15 years from now , with liberals declaring that Obamacare has been deficit-neutral and conservatives declaring that its created big fiscal problems , and with both sides having a reasonable ( and , yes , empirical ) point ."
-1	"No , I havent lost my mind  or suddenly become an Ayn Rand disciple . Its not my ideal ; in a better world Id call for single-payer , and a significant role for the government in directly providing care .But Ross Douthat , in the course of realistically warning his fellow conservatives that Obamacare doesnt seem to be collapsing , goes on to tell them that theyre going to have to come up with a serious alternative .But Obamacare IS the conservative alternative , and not just because it was originally devised at the Heritage Foundation . Its what a health-care system that does what even conservatives say they want , like making sure that people with preexisting conditions can get coverage , has to look like if it isnt single-payer .I dont really think one more repetition of the logic will convince many people , but here we go again . Suppose you want preexisting conditions covered . Then you have to impose community rating  insurers must offer the same policies to people regardless of medical history . But just doing that causes a death spiral , because people wait until theyre sick to buy insurance . So you also have to have a mandate , requiring healthy people to join the risk pool . And to make buying insurance possible for people with lower incomes , you have to have subsidies .And what youve just defined are the essentials of ObamaRomneyCare . Its a three-legged stool that needs all three legs . If you want to cover preexisting conditions , you must have the mandate ; if you want the mandate , you must have subsidies . If you think theres some magic market-based solution that obviates the stuff conservatives dont like while preserving the stuff they like , youre deluding yourself .What this means in practice is that any notion that Republicans will go beyond trying to sabotage the law and come up with an alternative is fantasy . Again , Obamacare is the conservative alternative , and you cant move further right without doing no reform at all ."
-1	"So Chris Christie says that Obamacare is a failure on a number of levels . Which levels , exactly ?I mean , first-year enrollment is above projections . The number of Americans without insurance has dropped sharply . Costs appear to be lower than expected , and more broadly cost control on health seems to be doing remarkably well:To some extent I suspect that Christie is living in the bubble ; I keep remembering how Rand Paul was shocked and disbelieving at the proposition that government employment had fallen under Obama , even though all it takes to know that is a quick look at public data .But its not just misinformation ; the reality doesnt matter for Christie , or Republicans in general . Just as tax cuts can never fail , programs that help the unlucky can never succeed ."
-1	"One of the odd rituals of American punditry  the most famous example is Karl Roves tantrum in 2012 , but it happens all the time  is the way pundits and operatives keep spinning after the polls have closed . Never mind the vote totals , and lets dispute the network projections ; my guy is still winning !The obvious question is , whats the point ? The votes are already in ; you cant build momentum , or attract more donations , or any of those other things that claims of imminent victory might do . Wouldnt election night be a good time to adopt the persona of hard-headed realist , not delusional wishful thinker ? Yet this hardly ever happens .Something like this is going on with Obamacare . Not a day goes by without some prominent Republican politician or pundit insisting that the enrollment numbers are phony , that more people are losing insurance than gaining it , etc.. I know thats what the base believes , because its what they hear from Rush and Fox . But you would think that important people would have someone around who has a clue , who knows that enrollment data and multiple surveys are all telling the same story of unexpected success . OK , maybe not  if famous senators dont have anyone to clue them in about BLS data , they might really still be living in the bubble . But thats really their choice .And the point is that with enrollment more or less closed for 2014 , theres not much point in spinning . OK , maybe if you can keep up the pretense all the way to November , you can slightly sway base voters for the midterms . But even thats doubtful  by the fall , were going to have a very clear picture of how things went ; and the shape of that picture has already been determined .I guess that what gets me is the  to use the technical term  wussiness of it all . Isnt there any space on the right for people who sell themselves as tough-minded , who condemn Obamacare on principle but warn their followers that its not on the verge of collapse ? Is the whole party so insecure , so unable to handle the truth , that it automatically shoots anyone bearing bad news ?And the answer appears to be yes ."
-1	"Just a quick note in support of government statisticians . They do an incredibly important job , and by and large do it very well . Theyve also maintained a well-deserved reputation for staying out of the political fray , of acting as civil servants , not party apparatchiks .You can argue that the Census decision to change its health-insurance questionnaire starting with the 2013 data wasnt such a good idea  in fact , I know a number of health care experts who are dismayed . But its really quite vile to have talk-show hosts who quite literally know nothing about the field , other than that theyre against covering the uninsured , casually accusing Census of cooking the books to support Obamacare .But remember , MSNBC is the liberal network , right ? Why dont they just hire Donald Trump and be done with it ?"
-1	"If youve been tracking the news on signups under the Affordable Care Act  which is easy thanks to Charles Gabas invaluable site  you already knew that the program was making a pretty good recovery from the botched start . Now , however , its official : as of the end of January signups were only about a million behind their projected track as of last spring , which means that as of March 31 the total is likely to be 6-point-something million rather than the projected 7 million . In other words , basically OK .But heres the thing : every online article Ive seen about the latest numbers is followed by a huge number of vitriolic comments insisting that it isnt true , that Obamacare is a total disaster . Some commenters declare that all the numbers are lies ; others , getting their take from right-wing bloggers , say that all of those who have signed up but not yet paid their first premium  ahem , 47 percent of the total  will never pay and are fake enrollees . And so on .You cant help but notice the resemblance to the unskewing fever of the final weeks of the 2012 election , when everyone on the right knew , just knew , that the polls showing a clear Obama edge were biased and wrong , and that if you reworked the numbers somehow they pointed to a Romney triumph .Now , you might ask , how do I know that the Obamacare unskewers are wrong ? Actually , I dont know that for sure  but its very unlikely that theyre right . For one thing , they are more or less the same as the poll unskewers  people who know nothing about the subject , but know what they want to believe . For another , CBO  which has a reputation to defend  thinks its going to be OK . Finally , the insurers , who have real money on the line , seem fairly calm , which wouldnt be the case if they saw really terrible enrollment .Two things are interesting about all of this . First , the right has evidently learned nothing from the unskewing debacle . And second , right-wingers are totally vested in the idea of an Obamacare collapse . They have no plan B , and their only answer to growing evidence that its not going to happen is furious denial ."

-1	"The Commonwealth Fund has a new study out on Obamacare enrollment , estimating that about 9.5 million people gained coverage through Medicaid and the exchanges ; this is roughly in line with some previous estimates but perhaps slightly more encouraging for the laws supporters . Jonathan Cohn uses the estimate to declare that the law is meeting expectations in covering the uninsured: The Congressional Budget Office predicted that , one year into full implementation , Obamacare would reduce the the number of Americans without insurance by 12 million . That included the young adults who got insurance before 2014 , by signing onto their parents plans . Theres been some controversy over exactly how many more young people are insured because of that new option , but the best estimates Ive seen place the number somewhere between 1 and 2.5 million . Add that number to the 9.5 million from the Commonwealth survey , and youre close or equal to the CBO projections .Of course , the Commonwealth survey has a hefty margin of error and the CBO projections , revised to take account of the early technological problems on Obamacare websites , were never that scientific . But the figures seem to be in the same ballpark . Thats what matters .In broad strokes , this is plausible : Obamacare has stabilized , its insuring substantial numbers of people , the disaster scenarios have been averted and most people getting coverage seem reasonably happy with it . I would only offer the caveat that when Cohn says in the same ballpark ,  he means in the same ballpark , but probably lower than what was hoped for , which in turn was lower than what was originally projected. That is , if the Commonwealth figure is right were probably looking at between 10 and 11 million newly-insured overall for 2014 ( Im relying on best estimates for the number of young adults that are slightly lower than Cohns ) , which is lower than the 12 million the C.B.O . projected in April , which is lower than the 13 million it projected after the website problems , which is lower than the 14 million it projected after the Supreme Court decision on Medicaid , which is lower  you get the idea .All of which means that this new estimate , while useful , doesnt really bring us any closer to knowing whether Obamacare enrollment will ultimately end up where its advocates hoped  making up ground lost during the disastrous roll-out over the next couple of years , and hitting 25-30 million newly insured by 2017 or so  or whether its current shortfalls will persist and it will end up many millions below that target .With that being said , there are other recent numbers  the surprising downward revisions on overall health care spending ( albeit revisions associated with a terrible first quarter for the economy ) , the continued downward trajectory of Medicare costs  that make it seem a little more likely that Obamacare will end up passing a different test on my recent what count as success list , by producing less in the way of health care cost inflation than its critics have expected . And if you throw in the suggestive data on health outcomes from the recent Massachusetts study , I think its entirely fair ( especially given where we were six months ago ! ) for the laws supporters to put a glass-half-full spin on what were seeing at the moment  even if theres still a long , long way to go ."
-1	"Update : And exchange-based enrollments pass 6 million . Gaba now projects 6.5 million by 3/31 , and with the extensions it will go higher . The original CBO projection of 7 million now looks basically right , despite the website woes .Predictably , Republicans are in an uproar over the latest tweak to the Obamcare signups  an extension of the March 31 deadline for people who say that they tried to apply but encountered technical difficulty . As Jonathan Cohn says , the real objection here seems to be not so much that Obama is overstepping his bounds as that this will make it possible for more people to get insurance .But I also have the sense that people in the GOP are still working with a completely wrong narrative  namely , that Obamacare is failing , and that these are desperate ploys to save a sinking ship . The reality is quite different : enrollments have clearly surged in the final month . Charles Gaba is now projecting 6.4 million through the exchanges , and many more directly purchased from insurers .True , we dont yet know how many signups were previously uninsured , and we dont know the age/health mix of the people signing up . So we dont know how well year one of the ACA really worked , and wont for some time . The point , however , is that the system has evidently overcome most of its teething troubles .How will the GOP respond when the numbers come in ? If present behavior is any guide , theyll spend months listening to unskewers claiming that nobody is actually going to pay for policies , or that there are untold millions who lost their insurance and cant replace it , etc , etc.. There really isnt any room in their worldview for the possibility that this thing might work ."
-1	"Back when rate shock , website problems and lagging enrollment were threatening to unravel the new health care law before it fully took effect , I concluded a column on Obamacares repeated near-death experiences with the following warning to conservatives:The welfare states ability to defend itself against reform , however , carries a cautionary message for Obamacares critics as well . What isnt killed outright grows stronger the longer its embedded in the federal apparatus , gaining constituents and interest-group support just by virtue of its existence even if it doesnt work out the way it was designed . And as disastrous as its launch has been , if the health care law can survive this crisis in the same limping , staggering way it survived Scott Brown and the Supremes , then it will be a big step closer to being part of the status quo , with all the privileges and political strength that entails .So yes  its possible that this brush with death will be fatal , possible that the law will fall with the lightest , most politically painless push . But its still likely that Obamacare will be undone only if its critics are willing to do something more painful , and take their own turn wrestling with a system that resists any kind of change .With the latest numbers showing exchange enrollment climbing toward 7 million , I think we can safely retire that possible ,  and change the likely to an all-but-definite. Not because rising enrollment proves that Obamacare is definitely working , in the sense that both its friends and critics would have originally understood the term . We dont know yet what the paid enrollment looks like or how successfully the program is actually enrolling the uninsured . ( After some grim estimates , this Rand study is making liberals feel a little more optimistic , but still suggests a below-expectations result . ) We dont know what the age-and-health-status composition of the enrollee pools looks like or what that means for premiums next year and beyond . We dont know if any of the suspended/postponed provisions of the law will actually take effect . And we certainly dont know what any of this means for social policy in the long run .But we do know that there wont be an immediate political unraveling , and that we arent headed for the kind of extremely-low-enrollment scenario that seemed conceivable just a few months ago , or the possible world where cancellations had ended up outstripping enrollment , creating a net decline in the number of insured . And knowing that much has significant implications for our politics . It means that the kind of welfare-state embedding described above is taking place on a significant scale , that a large constituency will be served by Obamacare ( through Medicaid as well as the exchanges ) in 2016 and beyond , and that any kind of conservative alternative will have to confront the reality that the kind of tinkering-around-the-edges alternatives to Obamacare that many Republicans have supported to date would end up stripping coverage from millions of newly-insured Americans . That newly-insured constituency may not be as large as the bills architects originally hoped , or be composed of the range of buyers that the program ultimately needs . But it will be a fact on the ground to an extent that was by no means certain last December . And that fact will shape , and constrain , the options of the laws opponents even in the event that Republicans manage to reclaim the White House two years hence .Such political and policy constraints , I should note , are potentially a good thing for would-be conservative reformers , since the serious right-of-center alternatives to Obamacare have always included policies to expand coverage , and with a coverage expansion accomplished , Republicans may find themselves effectively forced in a more serious direction . ( This is a drum that Avik Roy , among others , has been beating for some time . ) Or so I would hope ; of course , they might just end up drifting toward gimmicky micro-reforms instead , or find themselves embroiled a ruinous civil war over how hard to push toward some kind of full repeal .But wherever they go and whatever they do , they will have to deal with the reality that Obamacare , thrice-buried , looks very much alive ."
-1	"WashingtonIF Mitt Romneys pivots on Presidents Obamas health care reform act have accelerated to a blur  from repealing on Day 1 , to preserving this or that piece , to punting the decision to the states  it is for an odd reason buried beneath two and a half years of Republican political condemnations : the architecture of the Affordable Care Act is based on conservative , not liberal , ideas about individual responsibility and the power of market forces .This fundamental ideological paradox , drowned out by partisan shouting since before the plans passage in 2010 , explains why Obamacare has only lukewarm support from many liberals , who wanted a real , not imagined , government takeover of health care. It explains why Republicans have been unable since its passage to come up with anything better . And it explains why the law is nearly identical in design to the legislation Mr. Romney passed in Massachusetts while governor .The core drivers of the health care act are market principles formulated by conservative economists , designed to correct structural flaws in our health insurance system  principles originally embraced by Republicans as a market alternative to the Clinton plan in the early 1990s . The presidents program extends the current health care system  mostly employer-based coverage , administered by commercial health insurers , with care delivered by fee-for-service doctors and hospitals  by removing the biggest obstacles to that systems functioning like a competitive marketplace .Chief among these obstacles are market limitations imposed by the problematic nature of health insurance , which requires that younger , healthier people subsidize older , sicker ones . Because such participation is often expensive and always voluntary , millions have simply opted out , a risky bet emboldened by the 24/7 presence of the heavily subsidized emergency room down the street . The health care law forcibly repatriates these gamblers , along with those who can not afford to participate in a market that ultimately cross-subsidizes their medical misfortunes anyway , when they get sick and show up in that E.R . And it outlaws discrimination against those who want to participate but can not because of their medical histories . Put aside the considerable legislative detritus of the act , and its aim is clear : to rationalize a dysfunctional health insurance marketplace .This explains why the health insurance industry has been quietly supporting the plan all along . It levels the playing field and expands the potential market by tens of millions of new customers .The rationalization and extension of the current market is financed by the other linchpin of the law : the mandate that we all carry health insurance , an idea forged not by liberal social engineers at the Brookings Institution but by conservative economists at the Heritage Foundation . The individual mandate recognizes that millions of Americans who could buy health insurance choose not to , because it requires trading away todays wants for tomorrows needs . The mandate is about personal responsibility  a hallmark of conservative thought .IN the partisan war sparked by the 2008 election , Republicans conveniently forgot that this was something many of them had supported for years . The only thing wrong with the mandate ? Mr. Obama also thought it was a good idea .The same goes for health insurance exchanges , another idea formulated by conservatives and supported by Republican governors and legislators across the country for years . An exchange is as pro-market a mechanism as they come : free up buyers and sellers , standardize the products , add pricing transparency , and watch what happens . Market Economics 101 .In the shouting match over the health care law , most have somehow missed another of its obvious virtues : it enshrines accountability  yes , another conservative idea . Under todays system , most health insurers ( and providers ) are accountable to the wrong people , often for the wrong reasons , with the needs of patients coming last . With the transparency , mobility and choice of the exchanges , businesses and individuals can decide for themselves which insurers ( and , embedded in their networks , which providers ) deserve their dollars . They can see , thanks to the often derided benefits standardization of the reform act , what they are actually buying . They can shop around . And businesses are free to decide that they are better off opting out , paying into funds that subsidize individuals coverage and letting their employees do their own shopping , with what is , in essence , their own compensation , relocated to the exchanges .Back when the idea of letting businesses and consumers pick their own plans  with their own money on an exchange  first floated around Washington , advocates called them association health plans. They , too , would have corrected for the lack of transparency , mobility and choice in local insurance markets by allowing the purchase of health insurance across state lines . They were the cornerstone of what would have been the Bush administrations reform plan ( had the administration not been distracted by other matters ) . After the rejection of Hillarycare in the mid-90s , association health plans emerged as the centerpiece of pro-market , Republican thinking about health reform  essentially what would become Romneycare , extended via federal law to cover the entire country . So much for Mr. Romneys argument that his plan in Massachusetts was an expression of states rights . His own party had bigger plans for the rest of the country , and they looked a lot like Obamacare ."
-1	"WE need death panels .Well , maybe not death panels , exactly , but unless we start allocating health care resources more prudently  rationing , by its proper name  the exploding cost of Medicare will swamp the federal budget .But in the pantheon of toxic issues  the famous third rails of American politics  none stands taller than overtly acknowledging that elderly Americans are not entitled to every conceivable medical procedure or pharmaceutical .Most notably , President Obamas estimable Affordable Care Act regrettably includes severe restrictions on any reduction in Medicare services or increase in fees to beneficiaries . In 2009 , Sarah Palins rant about death panels even forced elimination from the bill of a provision to offer end-of-life consultations .Now , three years on , the Republican vice-presidential nominee , Paul D. Ryan , has offered his latest ambitious plan for addressing the Medicare problem . But like Mr. Obamas , it holds limited promise for containing the programs escalating costs within sensible boundaries .The Obama and Ryan plans are not without common ground ; both propose an identical formula for capping the growth in Medicare spending per beneficiary . And both dip into the same toolbox ( particularly lower payments to providers ) to achieve a reduction of nearly $ 1 trillion in Medicare expenditures over the next decade from projected levels .Thats where the agreement ends . Mr. Ryan believes that meeting the goal over the long term requires introducing more competition into Medicare through vouchers to purchase private insurance .But Ryans approach was rendered toothless when the issues brutal politics forced him to retreat from his initial tough plan to simply cap the growth in government spending on Medicare and stick the inevitable overage onto beneficiaries . Under his revised plan , private insurers would be required to offer the same level of benefits as traditional Medicare , meaning that any savings would have to come from unidentified efficiencies ( the ever-popular waste , fraud and abuse ) .If the cap was breached  as it almost certainly would eventually be  Mr. Ryan blithely says , Congress would be required to intervene. Fat chance ; Congress regularly does the opposite when it rolls back caps on payments to doctors and hospitals .Meanwhile , Mr. Obamas hopes for sustained cost containment are pinned on a to-be-determined mix of squeezing reimbursements , embracing a selection of the creative ideas that have spewed forth from health care policy wonks and scouring the globe for innovations .To Mr. Obamas credit , his plan has more teeth than Mr. Ryans ; if his Independent Payment Advisory Board comes up with savings , Congress must accept either them or vote for an equivalent package . The problem is , the advisory board cant propose reducing benefits ( a k a rationing ) or raising fees ( another form of rationing ) , without which the spending target looms impossibly large .Thats the view of the bipartisan Medicare trustees , whose 2012 report stated : Actual future Medicare expenditures are likely to exceed the intermediate projections shown in this report , possibly by quite large amounts.To be sure , health care cost increases have moderated , in part because of the recession and in part because Medicare has been tightening its reimbursements . But those thumbscrews cant be tightened forever ; Medicare reimbursement rates are already well below those of private providers .Lets not forget that with the elderly population growing rapidly , even if cost increases for each beneficiary can be contained , Medicare would still claim a rising share of the American economy .Medicare needs to take a cue from Willie Sutton , who reportedly said he robbed banks because thats where the money was . The big money in Medicare is not to be found in Mr. Ryans competition or Mr. Obamas innovation , but in reducing the cost of treating people in the last year of life , which consumes more than a quarter of the programs budget .No one wants to lose an aging parent . And with price out of the equation , its natural for patients and their families to try every treatment , regardless of expense or efficacy . But that imposes an enormous societal cost that few other nations have been willing to bear . Many countries whose health care systems are regularly extolled  including Canada , Australia and New Zealand  have systems for rationing care .Take Britain , which provides universal coverage with spending at proportionately almost half of American levels . Its National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence uses a complex quality-adjusted life year system to put an explicit value ( up to about $ 48,000 per year ) on a treatments ability to extend life .At the least , the Independent Payment Advisory Board should be allowed to offer changes in services and costs . We may shrink from such stomach-wrenching choices , but they are inescapable ."
-1	"Although few Americans say the Affordable Care Act has helped them , the uninsured rate has declined significantly since the law took effect , and appears to be leveling off at around 13.4 percent .Via GallupThe uninsured rate so far in the second quarter of 2014 is 13.4 % , with the rate in April and May as individual months also averaging 13.4 % , respectively .The percentage of U.S. adults lacking insurance coverage in the first two months of the second quarter of 2014 is down from 17.1 % in the fourth quarter of 2013 and from the 15.6 % average in the first quarter of 2014 . The current 13.4 % average for the second quarter of 2014 is the lowest level recorded since Gallup began tracking this measure in 2008 ."
-1	"The Congressional Budget Office said yesterday that the Affordable Care Act should be cheaper than originally projected .Via The New RepublicIn February , the last time CBO addressed these issues comprehensively , it predicted that the net cost of the laws coverage provisions would be about $ 1.4 trillion over ten years . Now , CBO says , its likely to be about $ 1.3 trillion , or $ 100 billion less .Its actually the latest in a series of revisions , each one suggesting the law would cost less money than the previous projection had suggested . And why this latest change ? It doesnt appear to be because the law will reach fewer people . CBO now expects slightly more people to end up with health insurance , at least over the long run . The CBOs primary explanation for lower costs is that health insurance premiums on the new exchanges  what the administration calls marketplaces are lower than CBO had originally expected they would be ."
-1	"The Obama administration said yesterday that it would treat the March 31 deadline for enrolling in a health plan somewhat flexibly . Consumers who begin to apply by March 31 will have until mid-April to finish .Relatedly , according to the Kaiser Health Tracking Poll for March , substantial shares of the uninsured population dont realize that the deadline to sign up for health insurance is fast approaching .As the clock ticks down on open enrollment for new coverage options under the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) , the latest Kaiser Health Tracking Poll finds that six in ten of the uninsured are unaware of the March 31 deadline to sign up for coverage . When reminded of the deadline and the fine for not getting covered , half of those who lack coverage as of mid-March say they plan to remain uninsured . Meanwhile , four in ten of the uninsured are still unaware of the laws subsidies to help lower-income Americans purchase coverage , and half dont know about the laws expansion of Medicaid."
-1	"The current state of public opinion on health reform is really peculiar . If youve been following the issue at all closely , you know that the Affordable Care Act is one of the great comeback stories of public policy : after a terrible start , it has dramatically exceeded expectations . But hardly anyone seems to know that .Its easy to understand how that happens for Fox-watchers and Rush-listeners , who are fed a steady diet of supposed Obamacare disaster stories . Remember this ?But the real story hasnt even gotten through to many people who should know better .Over the weekend I had dinner in NYC with some very smart , sophisticated people ; yes , all of them liberals . And almost everyone in the group was under the impression that Obamacare is still going badly  they wanted me to tell them whether it could still be turned around .Meanwhile , New York ( which created its own exchange ) is a huge success story : enrollment is 60 percent higher than federal projections , premiums have been cut in half .An aside : New York was already a community-rating state , where insurers werent allowed to discriminate based on medical history . But the result of that system was that healthy people tended to stay out of the individual market , creating a bad risk pool that drove up rates . Now everyone has to be in , dramatically improving the risk pool . As such , the New York experiences demonstrates the essential role of the individual mandate for reform .But anyway , back to the mystery : here we have smart , pro-reform people living in a state where reform is going really well . And they dont know it !In part this may reflect the Obama administrations lackluster job so far in getting the word out . But it also , I think , reflects a persistent anti-ACA tilt in news coverage . In the final days of March I wrote about the de facto blackout on the obvious surge in enrollments ; if you werent reading Charles Gaba and/or bloggers who followed him , you were in the dark about a huge developing story . And this tilt has continued .Just FYI : the article I linked above , about the spectacular success of New York reform , was on page A16 "
-1	"LOS ANGELES  THE Anthem Blue Cross representative who answered my call told me that there was a silver lining in the cancellation of my individual P.P.O . policy and the $ 5,400 annual increase that I would have to pay for the Affordable Care Act-compliant option : now if I have Stage 4 cancer or need a sex-change operation , Id be covered regardless of pre-existing conditions . Never mind that the new provider network would eliminate coverage for my and my sons long-term doctors and hospitals .The Anthem rep cheerily explained that despite the companys  I paraphrase  draconian rates and limited network , my benefits , which also include maternity coverage ( handy for a 46-year-old ) , would be actually much richer.I , of course , would be actually much poorer . And it was this aspect of the bum deal that , to my surprise , turned out to be a very unpopular thing to gripe about .Obamacare or Kafkacare ?  I posted on Facebook as soon as I hung up with Anthem . I vented about the call and wrote that the president should be protecting the middle class , not making our lives substantially harder . For extra sympathy , I may have thrown in the fact that Im a single mom . ( O.K. , I did . )Then I sat back and waited for the love to pour in . Or at least the like. Lots of likes . After all , I have 1,037 Facebook friends . Surely , theyd commiserate .Except that they didnt .Instead , aside from my friend David , who attempted to cheer me up with , My dad , who never turns down a bargain , would take the sex change just because its free ,  my respondents implied  in posts that , to my annoyance , kept getting more likes  that it was beyond uncool to be whining about myself when the less fortunate would finally have insurance .The nation has been better off ,  wrote one friend . Over 33 million people who did not have insurance are now going to get it. Thats all fine and good for the nation ,  but what about my $ 5,400 rate hike ( after-tax dollars , I wanted to add , but dared not in this group of previously closeted Mother Teresas ) ? Another friend wrote , Yes , Im paying an extra 200 a month , but Im okay with doing that so that others who need it can have health care.I was shocked . Who knew my friends were such humanitarians ? Has Obamacare made it un-P.C . to be concerned by a serious burden on my familys well-being ?The heated reactions even moved offline . Frustrated , I observed to one friend who was covered through her work that when an issue didnt affect people directly , they became theoretically generous. Ask them to donate several thousand dollars so that the less fortunate can have medical insurance  which is exactly what President Obama is asking me to do  and Ill bet theyd change their tune about ending inequality and creating fairness and doing whats good for the country.Refreshingly , the two people who showed real empathy were my insurance broker and my friend Nicole , who sent daily links to news stories about people who were also stripped of their coverage and mandated to buy expensive exchange or private policies without access to their current doctors , yet just missed the cutoff for subsidies .There was one story about people suing Anthem for not being grandfathered in after changing their policies post-2010 . In fact , it was in 2011 that I altered mine , dumping maternity benefits so that I didnt have to pay for everyone elses pregnancies . Little did I know Id end up losing my insurance and paying for everyone elses pregnancies .There was even an article about a cancer patient who had lost access to her doctors . To her credit , Nicole refrained from saying , But , Lori , this woman has cancer and you are so much more fortunate ! Like Bridget Joness smug marrieds ,  the smug insureds  friends who were covered through their own or spouses employers or who were grandfathered into their plans  asked why I didnt just switch all of our long-term doctors , suck it up and pay an extra $ 200 a month for a restrictive network on the exchange , or marry the guy Im dating . How romantic : I didnt marry you just to save money , honey . I married you for your provider network.Along with the smug insureds , President Obama doesnt care much about the relatively small percentage of us with canceled coverage and no viable replacement . He keeps apologizing while maintaining that its for the good of the country , a vast improvement over all.And the over all might agree . But the self-employed middle class is being sacrificed at the altar of politically correct rhetoric , with nobody helping to ensure our health , fiscal or otherwise , because its trendy to cheer for the underdog . Embracing the noble cause is all very well  as long as yours isnt the fortunate family that loses its access to comprehensive , affordable health care while the rest of the nation gets it .The truly noble act here is being performed by my friend Nicole , who keeps posting Obamacare fiasco stories on my Facebook page , despite being conspicuously ignored , except for my single like. Its the lone like that falls in the forest , the click nobody wants to hear ."
-1	"FRANKFORT , Ky.  SUNDAY morning news programs identify Kentucky as the red state with two high-profile Republican senators who claim their rhetoric represents an electorate that gave President Obama only about a third of its presidential vote in 2012 .So why then is Kentucky  more quickly than almost any other state  moving to implement the Affordable Care Act ?Because theres a huge disconnect between the rank partisanship of national politics and the outlook of governors whose job it is to help beleaguered families , strengthen work forces , attract companies and create a balanced budget .Its no coincidence that numerous governors  not just Democrats like me but also Republicans like Jan Brewer of Arizona , John Kasich of Ohio and Rick Snyder of Michigan  see the Affordable Care Act not as a referendum on President Obama but as a tool for historic change .That is especially true in Kentucky , a state where residents collective health has long been horrendous . The state ranks among the worst , if not the worst , in almost every major health category , including smoking , cancer deaths , preventable hospitalizations , premature death , heart disease and diabetes .Were making progress , but incremental improvements are not enough . We need big solutions with the potential for transformational change .The Affordable Care Act is one of those solutions .For the first time , we will make affordable health insurance available to every single citizen in the state . Right now , 640,000 people in Kentucky are uninsured . Thats almost one in six Kentuckians .Lack of health coverage puts their health and financial security at risk .They roll the dice and pray they dont get sick . They choose between food and medicine . They ignore checkups that would catch serious conditions early . They put off doctors appointments , hoping a condition turns out to be nothing . And they live knowing that bankruptcy is just one bad diagnosis away .Furthermore , their children go long periods without checkups that focus on immunizations , preventive care and vision and hearing tests . If they have diabetes , asthma or infected gums , their conditions remain untreated and unchecked .For Kentucky as a whole , the negative impact is similar but larger  jacked-up costs , decreased worker productivity , lower quality of life , depressed school attendance and a poor image .The Affordable Care Act will address these weaknesses .Some 308,000 of Kentuckys uninsured  mostly the working poor  will be covered when we increase Medicaid eligibility guidelines to 138 percent of the federal poverty level .PricewaterhouseCoopers and the Urban Studies Institute at the University of Louisville concluded that expanding Medicaid would inject $ 15.6 billion into Kentuckys economy over the next eight years , create almost 17,000 new jobs , have an $ 802.4 million positive budget impact ( by transferring certain expenditures from the state to the federal government , among other things ) , protect hospitals from cuts in indigent care funding and shield businesses from up to $ 48 million in annual penalties .In short , we couldnt afford not to do it .The other 332,000 uninsured Kentuckians will be able to access affordable coverage  most with a discount  through the Health Benefit Exchange , the online insurance marketplace we named Kynect : Kentuckys Healthcare Connection .Kentucky is the only Southern state both expanding Medicaid and operating a state-based exchange , and we remain on target to meet the Oct. 1 deadline to open Kynect with the support of a call center that is providing some 100 jobs . Having been the first state-based exchange to complete the readiness review with the United States Department of Health and Human Services , we hope to become the first one to be certified .Frankly , we cant implement the Affordable Care Act fast enough .As for naysayers , Im offended by their partisan gamesmanship , as they continue to pour time , money and energy into overturning or defunding the Affordable Care Act . Its shameful that these critics havent invested that same level of energy into trying to improve the health of our citizens .They insist that the Affordable Care Act will never work  when in fact a similar approach put into effect in Massachusetts by Mitt Romney , then the governor , is working .So , to those more worried about political power than Kentuckys families , I say , Get over it.The Affordable Care Act was approved by Congress and sanctioned by the Supreme Court . It is the law of the land .Get over it ... and get out of the way so I can help my people . Here in Kentucky , we can not afford to waste another day or another life ."
-1	"Conservatives appear to be really upset that liberals are actually taking on the facts in the anti-Obamacare ads theyve been running . How dare you question whether the people in these ads are giving an accurate picture  theyre suffering !OK , weve seen this kind of play before . Remember how anyone suggesting that Dick Cheney and whatshisname misled us into invading Iraq was attacking Americans brave fighting men and women ?But theres a different kind of struggle anyone trying to point out the facts encounters  a barrage of anecdotes . You say that the Obamacare horror stories are fake , but I kind of know this man who is being told that he has to buy a policy he cant possibly afford / I read this sad story in the Wall Street Journal / I heard this tale on the radio / etc..How do you answer that ?Well , it cant be done retail . If the Koch brothers are pouring money into ads featuring a person , or the GOP response to the SOTU tells a story , then its worth trying to track down the particulars of this case . But to deal with the broader problem of anecdotes , what you need is a framework that tells you which anecdotes are almost surely wrong .So heres what you need to understand . The Affordable Care Act isnt magic  it produces losers as well as winners . But its not black magic either , turning everyone into a loser . What the Act does is in effect to increase the burden on fortunate people  the healthy and wealthy  to lift some burdens on the less fortunate : people with chronic illnesses or other preexisting conditions , low-income workers .Suppose , then , that someone comes to you with an anecdote about a cancer patient , or just an older person in poor health , and tells you that this person is about to lose the care she needs , or face a huge increase in expenses , under Obamacare . Well , its almost certainly not true  people like that are overwhelmingly beneficiaries of health reform , thanks to community rating , which means that they cant be discriminated against because of their condition .Or suppose that someone tells you about a struggling worker who had adequate coverage but is now being confronted with unaffordable premiums . You should immediately ask , what about the subsidies ? Because the Affordable Care Act has subsidies that are there specifically to keep premiums affordable for lower earners .If someone insists that he knows about someone in these categories who really is being grievously hurt , well , the burden of proof rests with the claimant . Basically , stories like that are going to be very rare .Obamacare opponents could , of course , go with the real losers  people in the one percent paying higher taxes , healthy young men who are getting by with cheap , minimalist policies . But they want sob stories  the sick middle-aged woman facing tragedy . And so far , every single one of those sob stories has turned out to be false  because the very nature of the reform is such that such things hardly ever happen ."
-1	"Until just the other day , Obamacare was a total disaster ; no way would it meet its first-year enrollment targets , or come anywhere close .Now the opponents have retreated to their next line of defense : OK , people are signing up , but only because their existing policies were cancelled , so the program isnt actually reducing the number of uninsured .Oops:Furthermore:These early estimates understate the full effects of the Affordable Care Act on the uninsured for two major reasons . First , the survey does not capture the enrollment surge that occurred at the end of the open enrollment period , because 80 percent of the responses to the March 2014 HRMS were provided by March 6 , 2014 . Second , these estimates do not reflect the effects of some important ACA provisions ( such as the ability to keep dependents on health plans until age 26 and early state Medicaid expansions ) that were implemented before 2013 .Remember , this is just the first year . It has been assumed all along that it would take several years for the word to spread , and the law to have its full effect ."
-1	"You might think that the methodical extermination of millions of Jews by a brutal regime intent on world domination would resist appropriation as an all-purpose metaphor . You might think that genocide , of all things , would be safe from conversion into sloppy simile .Youd be wrong .After Paul Ryans fact-challenged address at the Republican National Convention last year , the chairman of the Democratic Party in California actually compared him and his compatriots to the Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels . A short time later , the chairman of the Democratic Party in South Carolina likened that states Republican governor , Nikki Haley , to Adolf Hitlers mistress , Eva Braun .At that point Abraham Foxman , the national director of the Anti-Defamation League , did what he shouldnt need to do even once , let alone the multiple times that hes been forced to . He implored politicians and pundits to stop it already .No matter . Allusions to Nazi Germany were back for debates over gun control and , of course , Obamacare . Ted Cruz , the Senates prince of tirades , compared people who claim that the new insurance program cant be stopped to those who rolled over for Hitler and the Third Reich . This prompted a public reprimand from John McCain , who has developed something of a sideline career of swatting Cruz on the nose . Theyre like a hapless master and his hopeless dachshund . The former keeps trying to housebreak the latter , while the latter just beams at every mess he makes .Its not only Nazis who are flourishing in this era of metaphors gone mad , of analogy bloat . Lynch mobs are also having a good go of it . A senator who was quoted anonymously in The Times last week used that term to describe the Republican lawmakers who had lit into Cruz during a private luncheon , and lynching was invoked more disturbingly by the chief executive officer of A.I.G. , who recently said that public complaints about Wall Street bankers bonuses were intended to get everybody out there with their pitchforks and their hangman nooses. This , he added , was sort of like what we did in the Deep South.How absolutely bonkers . And yet how unsurprising . Were awash these days in metaphors as overworked as our political debate is overwrought , and its impossible not to wonder how much one contributes to the other . When nuance and perspective exit the language , do they exit the conversation as well ? When you speak in ludicrous extremes , do you think that way , too ?Obamacare has proved to be not just ideologically divisive but linguistically fertile . Theres seemingly no event or passage in American history to which it cant be compared .The terrorist attacks of 9/11 ? Check . Back when Mike Pence , Indianas Republican governor , was still in Congress , he summoned that days horror to characterize the Supreme Court ruling that upheld the Affordable Care Act .Slavery ? Check . Ken Cuccinelli , the Republican candidate for governor of Virginia , has described opposition to Obamacare in terms of stands against fugitive slave laws .The hyperbole and hysteria make any constructive debate impossible , and they insult the past , robbing important events of the specific meaning and individual detail they deserve . Consider our recurring -gate mania . We equate each new scandal , whether extra-large or fun-size , with Watergate , and by willfully misremembering President Richard Nixons crimes , we dilute them . Its just a suffix for the taking , a point of comparison for such wildly unrelated matters as the spilled secrets of Arkansas law enforcement officers who were supposedly privy to Bill Clintons private life . Troopergate , that was called .For President Obama , Benghazi was supposed to be his Watergate , and so was the I.R.S.s scrutiny of conservative groups , and so were a bunch of other things I cant even remember anymore . They blur and fade , which is not to say they didnt matter . Its to say that when everything is supposedly like everything else , nothings distinctive . Its all one big mush .For that reason , among others , we should watch our words . They have consequences . As irresponsible and detestable as the recent actions of the most conservative wing of House Republicans have been , wed be better off without figurative talk of hostage taking and guns to heads , without headlines like one in The Huffington Post that said : Boehner Threatens to Shoot the Hostage. That sort of language only turns up the heat .And I cringe at how pointlessly hurtful it must have been for a 9/11 widow or widower to listen to the right-wing moralist Gary Bauer exhort voters to fight back against President Obamas agenda the way passengers on United Flight 93 fought back against hijackers . Or for Holocaust survivors to hear all this gratuitous Nazi talk .You know whats just like Germany in the 1930s ? Germany in the 1930s . Were in an unfortunate place , but we neednt travel back there to describe it ."
-1	"Like confused poll respondents , Scott Brown , the former Massachusetts Senator whos running for Senate in New Hampshire , says he thinks the Affordable Care Act is disastrous , but seems to like everything it does .Via VoxIn an interview with WBUR , he called Obamacare a disaster. Then he was asked what hes for  and he went on to describe Obamacare . Ive always felt that people should either get some type of health care options , or pay for it with a nice competitive fee ,  he said . Thats all great . I believe it in my heart . In terms of preexisting conditions , catastrophic coverages , covering kids , whatever we want to do. He even said it could include the Medicaid expansion [ for ] folks who need that care and coverage.Oh , he also promises his plan wont raise taxes , cut spending on Medicare , or make people drive very far to go to the hospital . So his plan will have more generous insurance options and no way to pay for them . In other words , his plan will be like Obamacare , but even better ! Call it Fauxbamacare ."
-1	"Ezra Klein , in his new capacity as one of the impresarios behind Vox , has written a pair of attention-grabbing posts  here , and then here  defending the proposition that Obamacare has , in some sense , won ,  and that conservatives who cant come to terms with that victory cant come to terms with reality itself . Reading them , it struck me that this argument would benefit from laying down some specific markers for the near future , because Klein seems to move back and forth between two definitions of success . At times , as when he writes that Obamacare has won its survival and allows that that there are still many good critiques to make of the law , he seems to be using a narrow definition , with which I mostly agree  the law wont collapse under its own weight , the enrollment levels are high enough to make a return to the coverage status quo ante unlikely , etc . But when he uses language like the individual mandate  is working and the law is back on its expected track ,  and concludes that  [ Kathleen Sebelius ] can leave with the law she helped build looking , shockingly , like a success ,  it implies a stronger definition of victory , in which Obamacare isnt just continuing , isnt just unlikely to be swiftly repealed , but is clearly succeeding as a policy in basically the way its advocates predicted that it would .So I think it would be useful for the laws supporters to specify the metrics/numbers/outcomes that would vindicate the latter claim . Here are three fronts where specificity would be helpful:Enrollment . In the summer of 2012 , after the Supreme Court decision freeing up states to reject the Medicaid expansion , the C.B.O . projected that 14 million Americans would get coverage under Obamacare in the first year , and 33 million by 2022 . This February , after the botched rollout , the projections were 13 million in 2014 , 27 million in the long run . The latest estimate , out this month , drops the 2014 projection down to 12 million , and the long-term number to 26 million . Meanwhile , the question of how many previously-uninsured people have gained insurance as of right now is , as this Vox explainer suggests , quite difficult to answer ( and sadly , it may be about to become even more difficult ) , but a guesstimate of 9-10 million seems pretty plausible  and short , N.B. , of even the C.B.O.s more modest projection for this year .So  how low can the numbers go before they start to make the law look like something less than a success ? I assume that liberals will declare victory , with some reason , if Obamacare meets the C.B.O.s current ( reduced ) expectations , this year and beyond . But what if it doesnt ? Suppose that by the end of 2016 , when the C.B.O . expects the total number of uninsured to have fallen by 25 million , its only fallen by , say , 15 million instead  and most of the previously uninsured are getting coverage through Medicare , while the exchanges are mostly populated by people whose prior individual-market coverage was cancelled , either in 2014 or once grandfathering runs out . Will that be a success story ? Presumably theres some kind of shortfall that the laws supporters would consider , if not a sign of outright failure , than at least a reason to be fairly disappointed with how Obamacare has worked . It would be helpful to know what they think that long-run number lies .The cost curve . Before we entered into the agony of the botched roll-out , the laws supporters were eagerly citing the persistently low rate of health care inflation as a sign that Obamacare was already working as designed , already having a beneficial effect . But as Voxs Sarah Kliff reported yesterday , the latest inflation numbers cast some doubt on that hopeful hypothesis , with federal data indicating that health care spending is now growing just as quickly as it was prior to the recession.Now this may be temporary : Some kind of cost inflation was always likely to be associated with this years roll-out of subsidies and Medicaid spending , and the laws supporters can reasonably argue that we should wait a few years , until the coverage expansion ( however large ) has become a normal feature of the system , to judge Obamacares impact on inflation overall .But at a certain point that judgment will need to be made . So , again , what should be the standard ? What should be the baseline ? Does Obamacare need to hold inflation to the low 2011-2012 pace ( a pace , again , that many liberals wanted to credit to its early impact ) in order to be counted as a cost-containing success ? Does it just need to hold inflation below , say , a 10 or 20-year average ? ( Note that both on its own terms and relative to overall inflation , health cost inflation had been declining for seven years before Obamacare was passed  so just holding either rate below the average of 2000-2010 would not actually be that impressive . ) In other words  what does the Affordable Care Act have to achieve in order to live up to its name ?Health outcomes . Its been crowded out by the website drama like everything else , but one of the major divides between Obamacare supporters and skeptics was over whether , and to what extent , the law would literally be a lifesaver  with writers like Klein famously invoking lives saved figures in the hundreds of thousands during the run-up to the laws passage , while doubters cited the surprisingly-weak link between insurance status and health outcomes , and raised the potential public-health downsides , in terms of innovations lost or never sought , of increasing government control .Now public health data can be even fuzzier and more debatable than cost inflation and enrollment numbers . But even with lower-than-hoped-for enrollment figures overall , we should still be able to see some of the happy consequences , at some point , if Klein et . al . are right : Looking back from 2020 or 2025 , certainly , there should be some kind of disjuncture between U.S. health outcomes pre- and post-Obamacare ( maybe a reversal of this trend , at the very least ? ) , and some kind of outcomes gap should open between states that implemented the law fully and states that refused the extra Medicaid dollars .So here , too , Im curious what liberals expect to see , what theyll count as vindication , what would disappoint them , and what kind of results they think will be sufficient to prove that Obamacare is , in fact , a lifesaving success .And then for my own part , Ill lay down this marker for the future : If , in 2023 , the uninsured rate is where the C.B.O . currently projects or lower , health inflations five-year average is running below the post-World War II norm , and the trend in the age-adjusted mortality rate shows a positive alteration starting right about now , I will write a post ( or send out a Singularity-wide transmission , maybe ) entitled I Was Wrong About Obamacare  or , if he prefers , just Ezra Klein Was Right."
-1	"TODAY marks the beginning of health care coverage under the Affordable Care Acts new insurance exchanges , for which two million Americans have signed up . Now that the individual mandate is officially here , let me begin with an admission : Obamacare is awful .That is the dirty little secret many liberals have avoided saying out loud for fear of aiding the presidents enemies , at a time when the ideal of universal health care needed all the support it could get . Unfortunately , this meant that instead of blaming companies like Novartis , which charges leukemia patients $ 90,000 annually for the drug Gleevec , or health insurance chief executives like Stephen Hemsley of UnitedHealth Group , who made nearly $ 102 million in 2009 , for the sky-high price of American health care , the presidents Democratic supporters bought into the myth that it was all those people going to get free colonoscopies and chemotherapy for the fun of it .I believe Obamacares rocky start  clueless planning , a lousy website , insurance companies raising rates , and the presidents telling people they could keep their coverage when , in fact , not all could  is a result of one fatal flaw : The Affordable Care Act is a pro-insurance-industry plan implemented by a president who knew in his heart that a single-payer , Medicare-for-all model was the true way to go . When right-wing critics expose the fact that President Obama endorsed a single-payer system before 2004 , theyre actually telling the truth .What we now call Obamacare was conceived at the Heritage Foundation , a conservative think tank , and birthed in Massachusetts by Mitt Romney , then the governor . The president took Romneycare , a program designed to keep the private insurance industry intact , and just improved some of its provisions . In effect , the president was simply trying to put lipstick on the dog in the carrier on top of Mitt Romneys car . And we knew it .By 2017 , we will be funneling over $ 100 billion annually to private insurance companies . You can be sure theyll use some of that to try to privatize Medicare .For many people , the affordable part of the Affordable Care Act risks being a cruel joke . The cheapest plan available to a 60-year-old couple making $ 65,000 a year in Hartford , Conn. , will cost $ 11,800 in annual premiums . And their deductible will be $ 12,600 . If both become seriously ill , they might have to pay almost $ 25,000 in a single year . ( Pre-Obamacare , they could have bought insurance that was cheaper but much worse , potentially with unlimited out-of-pocket costs . )And yet  I would be remiss if I didnt say this  Obamacare is a godsend . My friend Donna Smith , who was forced to move into her daughters spare room at age 52 because health problems bankrupted her and her husband , Larry , now has cancer again . As she undergoes treatment , at least she wont be in terror of losing coverage and becoming uninsurable . Under Obamacare , her premium has been cut in half , to $ 456 per month .Lets not take a victory lap yet , but build on what there is to get what we deserve : universal quality health care .Those who live in red states need the benefit of Medicaid expansion . It may have seemed like smart politics in the short term for Republican governors to grab the opportunity offered by the Supreme Court rulings that made Medicaid expansion optional for states , but it was long-term stupid : If those 20 states hold out , they will eventually lose an estimated total of $ 20 billion in federal funds per year  money that would be going to hospitals and treatment .In blue states , lets lobby for a public option on the insurance exchange  a health plan run by the state government , rather than a private insurer . In Massachusetts , State Senator James B. Eldridge is trying to pass a law that would set one up . Some counties in California are also trying it . Montana came up with another creative solution . Gov . Brian Schweitzer , a Democrat who just completed two terms , set up several health clinics to treat state workers , with no co-pays and no deductibles . The doctors there are salaried employees of the state of Montana ; their only goal is their patients health . ( If this sounds too much like big government to you , you might like to know that Google , Cisco and Pepsi do exactly the same . )All eyes are on Vermonts plan for a single-payer system , starting in 2017 . If it flies , it will change everything , with many states sure to follow suit by setting up their own versions . Thats why corporate money will soon flood into Vermont to crush it . The legislators wholl go to the mat for this will need all the support they can get : If you live east of the Mississippi , look up the bus schedule to Montpelier .So lets get started . Obamacare cant be fixed by its namesake . Its up to us to make it happen ."
-1	"A panel of the D.C. federal appellate court ruled today that the federal government does not have the authority to administer insurance subsidies in states that refused to set up their own exchanges . If the ruling standsa big ifit could deprive millions of enrollees of the support they need to purchase health insurance .Via The Incidental EconomistHow much will this decision cost the working poor ? The amount varies with income and other variables , but for a 40 year old individual making $ 30,000 a year , the tax credit was estimated at $ 1345 ( KFF estimate here ) . Retroactive tax bills under Halbig will be significant and everyone impacted will have trouble paying for health insurance going forward ( about 57 % of exchange participants were previously uninsured , according to a KFF survey ) . How many people will be hurt ?At first glance : anyone receiving tax credits in the 27 states with federally facilitated exchanges ( FFEs ) : ( AL , AK , AZ , FL , GA , IN , KS , LA , ME , MS , MO , MT , NE , NJ , NC , ND , OH , OK , PN , SC , SD , TN , TX , UT , VA , WI and WY ; KFF list here ) . But the government reports 36 states as having FFEs , including 9 additional states not included on the list above ( ID , NM , AR , DE , IL , IA , MI , NH , and WV ; more on this below ) . Using this broader definition , 4.683 million Americans may now have a surprising tax bill and be at risk of losing health insurance , being told retroactively that they didnt qualify for tax credits after all ."
-1	"The Times has a very nice survey of the results to date of the Affordable Care Act , aka Obamacare , aka death panels and the moral equivalent of slavery .The verdict : Its going well . A big expansion in coverage , which is affordable for a large majority ; the main exceptions seem to be people who went for the minimum coverage allowed , keeping premiums down but leaving large co-payments . None of the predictions of disaster has come even slightly true ."
-1	"Yesterday , Ohio governor John Kasich briefly made news when the Associated Press quoted him saying that repeal of Obamacare was simply not gon na happen ,  and adding that the opposition to it was really either political or ideological ,  and in either case insufficiently attuned to the real improvements in peoples lives. Liberals pounced , conservatives groaned , and Kasich quickly went into damage control mode , explaining that he was only talking about the Medicaid expansion , which he had already explicitly supported and implemented , and not the rest of the law , which he still officially wants to ( say it with me ) repealandreplace .That last is the official position , of course , of the entire Republican Party , which currently enjoys , per my colleagues at The Upshot , a 66 percent chance of seizing a Senate majority in two weeks time . But the controversy around Kasichs comments are a useful reminder that not only is there no Republican consensus on how to actually replace the health care law , but almost no G.O.P . Senate candidates are actually campaigning on a politically credible replacement plan  with politically credible defined , for reasons Ive elaborated on before , as not rolling coverage levels back toward the pre-Obamacare status quo.The one major exception is Ed Gillespie , running against Mark Warner in Virginia , whose plan Ramesh Ponnuru has commented on and defended here and here . ( Since Gillespies background is in what Ive called the donorist wing of the party , which does not always distinguish itself in pushing middle-class-friendly economic policy , he deserves particular credit for taking the policy leap . ) But Gillespie is also , per current polling , unlikely to join a Republican Senate majority next year , whereas many G.O.P . candidates  the potential Majority Leader included  who have hemmed and hawed or talked in anti-Obamacare boilerplate and vague generalities when asked about health care policy are more likely to pull their races out . Which will be seen by some , no doubt , as vindicating the risk-averse , somewhat cynical approach to health policy that Republicans have taken throughout the health care debate  except , of course , that in this cycle that debate is happening against the backdrop of a political map that heavily favors the G.O.P. , whereas in 2016 ( as in 2012 ) the map will be different , tougher , and the health care law ( while no doubt still unpopular overall ) will be more locked-in , more a part of peoples ordinary experience , and the promise of full repeal will look even sketchier than it does now . At which point a Republican Party that wants to be competitive nationally will start to feel a lot of pressure ( probably not quite enough to counteract the influence of the primary electorate , but well see ) to drift toward something like Kasichs ( quite popular , in a purple state ) position , which basically amounts to if you like the single-payer part of Obamacare , you can keep the single-payer part of Obamacare , and lets talk about the other stuff later.For conservatives who dont want their party to gradually , eventually , inevitably end up taking roughly that position in national elections , then , theres a pretty narrow window to rally around something like the Gillespie approach instead . That window was open in this campaign ; I think it will be open again in 2016 . After that , though , the political risks ( already real enough ) associated with backing a legitimate Obamacare alternative will rise apace , the downsides of calling for outright repeal will likewise increase , and Republicans running for office outside red states will probably just end up endorsing the views that Ohios popular governor is dancing around right now .Of course events might intervene , but for now anti-Obamacare but reform-minded conservatives should be rooting for Gillespie to pull off a miracle comeback  because a party that can not imitate his Obamacre position today will almost certainly accept John Kasichs position tomorrow ."
-1	"A peculiar aspect of the Obama years has been the disconnect between the rage of Obamas enemies and the yawns of his sort-of allies . The right denounces financial reform as a vast government takeover  and lobbies fiercely against it  while the left dismisses reform as symbols without substance . The right accuses Obama of being a socialist stealing the money of hard-working billionaires , while the left dismisses him as having done nothing to address inequality .On all these issues , the truth is that Obama has done far more than he gets credit for  not everything youd want , to be sure , or even most of what should be done , but enough so that the right has reason to be furious .The latest case in point : taxes on the one percent . I keep hearing that Obama has done nothing to make the one percent pay more ; the Congressional Budget Office does not agree:According to CBO , the effective tax rate on the one percent  reflecting the end of the Bush tax cuts at the top end , plus additional taxes associated with Obamacare  is now back to pre-Reagan levels . You could argue that we should have raised taxes at the top much more , to lean against the widening of market inequality , and I would agree . But its still a much bigger change than I think anyone on the left seems to realize ."
-1	"Or , actually , demonstrates by example whats wrong with Washington .Matt Yglesias finds Ron Fournier saying this about health reform:On health care , we needed a market-driven plan that decreases the percentage of uninsured Americans without convoluting the U.S. health care system . Just such a plan sprang out of conservative think tanks and was tested by a GOP governor in Massachusetts , Mitt Romney .Instead of a bipartisan agreement to bring that plan to scale , we got more partisan warfare . The GOP resisted , Obama surrendered his mantle of bipartisanship , and Democrats muscled through a one-sided law that has never been popular with a majority of the public .The mind reels . How is it possible for anyone who has been following politics and , presumably , policy for the past six years not to know that Obamacare is , in all important respects , identical to Romneycare ? It has the same three key provisions  nondiscrimination by insurers , a mandate for individuals , and subsidies to make the mandate workable . It was developed by the same people . I and many others have frequently referred to ObamaRomneycare .Well , Ive know for years that many political pundits dont think that understanding policy is part of their job . But this is still extreme . And Im sorry to go after an individual here  but for Gods sake , dont you have to know something about the actual content of a policy you critique ?And whats actually going on here is worse than ignorance . Its pretty clear that were watching a rule of thumb according to which if Republicans are against a proposal , that means it must be leftist and extreme , and the burden on the White House is to find a way to make the GOP happy . Needless to say , this rewards obstructionism  there is literally nothing Obama can do to convince some ( many ) pundits that hes making a good faith effort , because they dont pay any attention to what he does , only to the Republican reaction .Awesome ."
-1	"Very busy , so no substantive posting today . But I did want to share a thought from the past few days . I posted about the surprisingly good news , at least so far , on Obamacare premiums for 2015  and as usual was met with a wall of rage from the right . The idea that this thing might be working inspires a level of anger nothing else ( except maybe climate science ) matches .No news there . Nor is it news that such people know things that aint so . But theres something Ive noticed from the combination of reactions to what I write and researching past coverage of Obamacare . It goes like this : a lot of the untrue beliefs people have about Obamacare come not so much from outright false reporting as from selective reporting . Every suggestion of bad news gets highlighted  especially , of course , but not only by Fox , the WSJ , etc.. But when it turns out that the news wasnt really that bad , these sources just move on . There are claims that millions of people are losing coverage  headlines ! When it turns out not to be true  crickets ! Some experts claim that premiums will rise by double digits  big news ! Actual premium numbers come in and theyre surprisingly low  not mentioned .The result is that most news consumers  who form impressions rather than trying to work out details  have the sense that its been all bad news . This is true even for people who dont rely on Fox  I get asked about the scary premium hikes by people on the Upper West Side ! And of course for those who do get their news from Fox , well , they know , just know , that Obamacare has reduced the number of Americans with insurance and caused premiums to double or something , even though even their favorite news source isnt saying such things .We need a term for beliefs based on reports that have been superseded ; maybe fossils instead of zombies . Anyway , its striking ."
-1	"One thing about the Obamacare denialists : they dont give up . First nobody but the sick would sign up , so wed have a death spiral . Then it was OK , a lot of people have signed up , but they wont pay  and anyway , even more people have lost coverage. Now they face evidence like this:And the response Im seeing is Its not Obamacare , its the improving economy .But it isnt . The decline is too sharp , too closely associated with the enrollment period to be driven by the at best gradual improvement in the job market . But wait , theres more . The Urban Institute breaks down the decline in uninsurance by Medicaid adoption or not , which is closely correlated with the general question of whether states are helping implementation or blocking it . Heres how it looks:Sorry , an improving economy cant explain why the decline in uninsured is three times as large in pro-Obamacare states as it is in anti-reform states .Its the policy , stupid ."
-1	"President Obama wrote on Monday that the Federal Communications Commission should issue strong regulations to prevent cable and phone companies from dividing the Internet into fast and slow lanes .Writing in more detail than he has offered previously on the subject , Mr. Obama said the commission , which is independent of the administration , should undo a long-standing regulatory mistake by re-classifying broadband Internet service as a telecommunications service , not a lightly-regulated information service . That would allow the commission to ban cable and phone companies from blocking , slowing down or otherwise interfering with the videos , music and other content that their customers access on the Internet . As we wrote in an editorial on Sunday , under current rules companies like Verizon and Time Warner Cable have the right to favor some content over others . For example , they could decide to deliver content from a provider that pays them a fee faster than information from competing services . Such arrangements would limit consumer choice and the ability of start-ups to compete on the Web .We can not allow Internet service providers ( ISPs ) to restrict the best access or to pick winners and losers in the online marketplace for services and ideas ,  Mr. Obama wrote .Not surprisingly , cable and phone companies and some of their supporters in Congress are not happy with Mr. Obamas proposal . Comcast issued a statement calling it a radical reversal that would harm investment and innovation , as todays immediate stock market reaction demonstrates. ( Shares of Comcast were down 3.8 percent at noon , but shares in Verizon and AT & T were up slightly . ) Senator Ted Cruz tried , confusingly and desperately , to link Mr. Obamas proposal to health reform , a favorite whipping boy of Republicans that is actually working quite well:Net Neutrality is Obamacare for the Internet ; the Internet should not operate at the speed of government . Senator Ted Cruz ( @ SenTedCruz ) 10 Nov 14The industrys concerns are unfounded and self-interested . And the reaction of lawmakers like Mr. Cruz is partisan hyperbole . Mr. Obama made clear that he does not want the F.C.C . to regulate broadband as it regulates traditional telephone service even if it reclassifies it as a telecommunications service . For example , there is no reason for the commission to regulate the price of Internet service , as regulators do for traditional home phone lines .But other telecommunications rules should apply . For example , federal telephone regulations make sure that you can use your AT & T phone to call people using T-Mobile by requiring the companies to connect their networks to each other . The same should be true on the Internet  you should be able to use Netflix just as easily as you would be able to use Amazons streaming service .This is at the heart of what Mr. Obama is proposing:For almost a century , our law has recognized that companies who connect you to the world have special obligations not to exploit the monopoly they enjoy over access in and out of your home or business . That is why a phone call from a customer of one phone company can reliably reach a customer of a different one , and why you will not be penalized solely for calling someone who is using another provider . It is common sense that the same philosophy should guide any service that is based on the transmission of information  whether a phone call , or a packet of data .Mr. Obamas reasoning might not satisfy phone and cable companies or their friends in Congress , who have a visceral allergic reaction to regulations . But that should not stop the F.C.C . from adopting his well-argued proposal ."
-1	"David Brooks : Well , that was pretty much a complete drubbing .Gail Collins : Dont rub it in , David .David : I guess the Republicans will pick up between eight and 10 Senate seats once the dust settles in Alaska , Virginia and Louisiana . The victories at the gubernatorial level are even more impressive . Scott Walkers win in Wisconsin was pretty significant . The biggest surprise to me was Larry Hogan getting himself elected governor of thoroughly blue Maryland . Plus Bruce Rauners win as governor of Illinois was unexpected and huge . This was a national verdict .Gail : Yeah , things were even worse than I expected . The most depressing result , for me , was Sam Brownback being re-elected governor in Kansas . If you can wreck the states economy and not get punished at all  I dont know what there is to say .David : It seems to me the Republican challenge is to understand what the party has done right without getting carried away by triumphalism . The Democratic challenge is to understand where the party went wrong without giving way to despair . Maybe we can talk about strengths and weaknesses ?Gail : Well , I guess thats better than staying here under the bed , curled in a fetal position . You first .David : I guess the beginning of Republican wisdom is to understand that this was more a case of the Democrats losing this particular election than it was a case of the Republicans winning it . The Democrats have talked a lot about wage stagnation and income inequality but they have offered nothing compelling to address these problems . President Obama lost the House four years ago because he seemed too liberal for the country after the passage of Obamacare . He lost the Senate this year because he seemed too passive , not competent , not in control . The rollout of Obamacare was the crucial moment of his second term .Gail : I agree that the president has often seemed passive . And theres been a lot of misspeaking for somebody whos supposed to be a great communicator . But I dont buy the idea that the Democrats failed to address wage stagnation and income inequality . Raise the minimum wage , create good jobs improve the nations roads and bridges , expand quality pre-K programs to give the next generation a boost  thats pretty much all they talked about .David : The big Republican accomplishment is that they have detoxified their brand . Four years ago they seemed scary and extreme to a lot of people . They no longer seem that way . The wins in purple states like North Carolina , Iowa and Colorado are clear indications that the party can at least gain a hearing among swing voters . And if the G.O.P . presents a reasonable candidate ( and this years crop was very good ) , then Republicans can win anywhere . I think weve left the Sarah Palin phase and entered the Tom Cotton phase .Gail : I wouldnt call this years crop very good , except in the sense that theyre definitely a less extreme group than we saw in the last few seasons . Although some  like Joni Ernst , who won the Senate seat in Iowa  are still downright scary .But the Republicans have gotten very good at teaching their candidates how to tamp down political screechiness .David : I was especially struck by Ed Gillespies amazing showing in Virginia . He ran one of the more policy-oriented campaigns in the country . At a time when consultants around the nation insulted voters intelligence with dumb campaigns , he honored their intelligence by talking about policy and was rewarded for it , win or lose . Maybe it takes a guy who has been a professional consultant to not listen to the consultants .Gail : Virginia shocked me . And Kay Hagans loss in North Carolina saddened me . The new Democratic South seems to exist mainly in theory .David : Scott Walkers victory in Wisconsin is also significant . The public is clearly unhappy with public sector unions , even in a traditionally progressive place like Wisconsin . Faced with a budget crisis , a mayor or governor can take on those unions and survive and even thrive . Hell become a compelling national figure in 2016 .Gail : Yeah , when the only unions left standing are the ones composed of people who work for the taxpayers , the labor movement is in a pretty sad shape . The Republicans have done a very good job of making it almost impossible to organize in the private sector .David : I wouldnt give up on private sector unions . I suspect some institution will grow up to give workers more bargaining power against employers , even if it doesnt look like the 20th-century model .Republicans should be wary of over-interpreting their mandate . Scott Brown ran hard against immigration reform and he was a rare Republican loser last night .Gail : That seemed like a weird choice of themes for New Hampshire , but maybe Brown just forgot which state he was campaigning in . I will refrain from making any jokes about how his next move will be to buy a camper and head for California , where Barbara Boxer is up for re-election in 2016 . There will always be a woman running for the Senate somewhere who he can challenge .David : I would love to see a Brown-Boxer race . Sort of a setup for a U.P.S . advertising campaign . The deeper problem for Republicans is their party still has no growth agenda . Figuring out a set of policies commensurate with the size of the structural economic issues is the next big task .Gail : See , thats the frustrating thing . For the last two years the Senate has had Democratic committee chairs who went out of their way to work with Republicans on economic issues . But they were stonewalled by the Republican leadership . And then the voters blamed the Democratic incumbents for gridlock .David : For Democrats , I guess one big lesson is : Stop talking to each other . Democratic politicians spent the early part of the year running against the Koch brothers . That argument may scare a lot of people in liberal bastions , but no one outside of these bastions knows about them or cares .Gail : Its totally true that politicians and the media care much more about campaign contributors than voters do I always secretly thought that if God wanted Americans to care about campaign finance reform he would have made it easier to explain . Although there was that one brief , shining moment in 2000  John McCain . Presidential primary . New Hampshire . Amazing to think back on how that one guy in a bus just went from town meeting to town meeting talking about how to get money out of politics .Gone but not quite forgotten .David : Then the Democrats came back with the 2012 playbook  all the talk about contraception and womens issues . That was tone deaf , given where the country is .Gail : I dont agree at all . Of course you cant give the impression that reproductive rights is the only thing youre running on . But the real problem for the Democrats was that the Republicans figured out how to defuse the issue.Ask me about abortion and Ill tell you that birth control pills should be sold over the counter .The Democrats arent going to have the luxury of running against the kind of Cro-Magnon candidates the Republicans were putting up a few years ago . Although I was tickled to see that the congressman in Florida who held the men-only gathering went down the drain . You know , the one who felt guys needed to be by themselves so they could feel free to drink , smoke and discuss serious topics .David : Democrats also need to ask themselves what it will take for them to be a congressional party once again . That means winning in places likes Arkansas , once solid Democratic states . Over the near term it means shelving theories about an emerging Democratic majority  hoping that a tide of Democratic voters will sweep the Democrats into permanent power . That still may happen over the long term , but Democrats are just terrible at appealing to white voters , especially less-educated white voters .Gail : No matter what the demographics of the future are going to look like , you obviously want candidates who can appeal to poor white and poor minority candidates at the same time . But its not easy to do . I dont think the Republicans are meeting uneducated white voters needs . Theyre just appealing to their fear of change .David : The core problem for Democrats , it seems to me , is that voters are just too skeptical of government  at least as it currently exists . Obamacare may not have been a huge issue , but Republicans ran lots of ads about it , and it remains deeply unpopular . Democrats somehow need to figure out how to offer government programs when people are innately suspicious of government as something alien and ineffective .Gail : The Republicans have done a terrific job of making their base hate government , even when they benefit greatly from government programs . And its ironic that President Obama , who ran as a great communicator , has been so awful at countering that message .David : The final point is that this election marks the end of the Obama presidencys power on the domestic front . In 2008 , I would not have expected it to come to this . The verdict is still out on what Obamas legacy will be , but its certainly true that he did not succeed where F.D.R. , Reagan and even Clinton did  in building a plausible majority for his party .Gail : I know that the rule of our pundit profession is that now we must turn our attention completely away from the current administration and do nothing but speculate about the presidential race in 2016 . But I want to give Obama a little more time before I declare him a goner . If he leaves behind a national health care program and a significant start to the battle against climate change , hell have actually accomplished much more as president than Clinton did . But I guess the nation wont learn to appreciate him unless hes impeached ."
-1	"The politics of Obamacare are clearly starting to shift . Its not that the public is coming to love it  not yet , anyway . But its less and less of a bogeyman , with polls suggesting a majority of the public against flat-out repeal . So theres increasing pressure on Republicans to lay out an alternative  and continuing surprise about their inability to articulate one .But this is an example of why it sometimes helps , even in straight political reporting , to understand how policy works . Heres the essential fact about health care policy , which in turn fundamentally shapes health care politics:Obamacare looks the way it does because it has to .Once again , for those who missed it : if you want to cover people with preexisting conditions , you must have community rating . If you want to have community rating without a death spiral  that is , if you want to keep an acceptable risk pool  you have to have an individual mandate . If you want to have an individual mandate , you have to have subsidies for lower-income Americans . And thats Obamacare : a three-legged stool , with all three legs essential .Republicans cant offer an alternative because there isnt one ( aside , that is , from single-payer ) . Their plan , such as it was , was to wait for the plan to implode , so they would never be put on the spot ; since that isnt happening , Plan B is to bob and weave and avoid the question until the midterms . Thats all there is ."
-1	"For reference : I count at least six distinct predictions of Obamacare doom made by the usual suspects , not one of which has come true . Here they are:1 . Enrollment will be very low , and2 . Even if people sign up , they wont pay their premiums .Reality : Signups exceeded expectations , and the vast majority paid .3 . More people will lose coverage cancelled by Obamacare than gain it .Reality : Sharp drop in the number of uninsured .4 . Rate shock .Reality : Like it says , affordable care .5 . Young people not signing up , and death spiral .Reality : Pretty good demographics .6 . Soaring health costs .Reality : Health costs are below anyones expectations .Its quite an impressive track record , actually . And whats even more impressive is that none of the usual suspects will even consider admitting having been wrong ."

But at Monday nights debate in Lexington , both Senator Mitch McConnell and his Democratic challenger , Alison Lundergan Grimes , the Kentucky Secretary of State , reached absurd heights in the art of weasel-wording .Ms. Grimes knew the question was coming , since shes fielded it several times in the last few days . The host of the debate , Bill Goodman , asked Ms. Grimes for whom shed voted in the 2012 presidential election . Ill take a wild guess here that Ms. Grimes , a Democrat who was a member of the Kentucky delegation to the Democratic National Convention two years ago , went for the Democrat : Barack Obama . But she refused to say  because shes petrified of being linked with the president , who is deeply unpopular in Kentucky . Instead , she took umbrage on the grounds that the Kentucky constitution guarantees ballot box secrecy . She actually made the preposterous claim that by ducking the question she was standing on constitutional principle .Mr. McConnell then made her look foolish by freely sharing his votes in the 2008 and 2012 presidential contests , as well as in the 2010 Senate race , when he voted for Trey Grayson , who lost to Rand Paul , the Tea Party darling .Mr. McConnell , whos been in Washington long enough 30 years  to know how to speak without communicating any information , had plenty of opportunity to show off his considerable obfuscation skills .Is the minimum wage a living wage , Mr. Goodman asked Mr. McConnell . Its an entry-level wage ,  said Mr. McConnell , hardly an answer .Is climate change real ? Before he could plead that he was not a scientist ,  Mr. Goodman pointed out that although the senator was not an economist , he was willing to share his opinions on the economy . In a tight spot , Mr. McConnell said : There are a bunch of scientists who feel there is a problem and maybe we can do something about it.Lest he be accused of siding with environmentalists , he added the caveat that scientists in the 1970s thought we were moving toward an ice age , and closed by declaring that his job , as United States Senator from Kentucky , was to fight for coal jobs in the state .Mr. McConnell approached Ms. Grimess ballot box secrecy-level of absurdity when Mr. Goodman asked him if Obamacare and Kynect had been a boon or bane for the state . The difficulty for Mr. McConnell is that the Affordable Care Act is politically toxic in Kentucky , while Kynect  which is the states health insurance program created under the Affordable Care Act  is a runaway success .Mr. McConnells attempt to separate the two made no sense . The Affordable Care Act should be pulled out root and branch. As for Kynect , thats just a website . It was paid for by a grant . The website can continue.Seeking clarity , Mr. Goodman asked if Mr. McConnell would support the continuation of Kynect . Yeah , I think its fine to have a website , yeah ,  said the senator .Thats like saying that Google should cease to exist but that Google.com should live on ."

Charles Gaba:Theres the usual yammering about But how many have PAID ? ? ?  , But how many were ALREADY INSURED ? ? ?  , How many were YOUNG ? ? ?  and What METAL LEVEL did they get ? ? ?  etc etc etc .

-1	"My Sunday column considered various possible and partial explanations for President Obamas long year of low approval ratings , which seem likely to help cost his party control of the Senate tomorrow . The big four I considered were structural forces ( the idea that polarization and gridlock alone suffice to send most second-term presidents regressing to the low 40s ) , the essential mediocrity of our recovered economy , the continued unpopularity of Obamacare , and foreign policy ( where the presidents approval ratings have fallen hard ) as a kind of synecdoche for larger doubts about the administrations basic competence . Obviously there are many more factors one could consider , but since I write about the issue frequently I thought I should explain why I didnt include immigration , another area where the presidents approval numbers have plummeted as his administration has stumbled in various ways over the last year .My reasoning , basically , was similar to the reasoning I use when analyzing the commonplace claim that immigration is about to doom Republicans forever : I just dont see a lot of evidence that the issue usually moves that many votes , white or Hispanic or otherwise , no matter which way it happens to be cutting at the moment . Its true that recent events ( the child migrant surge , the White Houses strange handling of its promised amnesty , the climate of Ebola-related anxiety ) have made the politics of immigration for favorable to conservatives than they were a couple of years ago , and the failure to pass immigration reform probably contributes something to Hispanic disappointment with the president . But I still feel that immigration is ultimately more a kind of subplot within the broader categories my column proposed  one reason among many to be anxious about presidential competence , or one reason among many to blame Obama for gridlock  than an issue that deserves pride of place in analyzing the presidents weakened position .Some evidence : If you look at some recent polls on voter priorities , immigration is ( of course ) swamped by the economy , but it also tends to be cited only about half as often the national security/international affairs/terrorism nest of issues , which I think has played a much larger role in undercutting the publics approval of the president . Likewise , if you look at this feature that maps midterm-election conversations on social media , youll see immigration getting significant play mostly in districts in the south and west that are already overwhelmingly represented by Republicans ,  rather than dominating the conversation in swing states . Again , that doesnt mean its an inconsequential issue , but it does make me doubt its distinctive power over the presidents ( un ) popularity and his partys midterm fate .I could be wrong , of course . If I were inclined to play Mickey Kaus for a day and elevate immigrations significance a little higher , it would be on the grounds that the immigration debate is an important case study in just how easily cracks can can open up within the presidents 2008/2012 majority , and how the Democratic Partys diversity-as-strength approach to coalition-building can turn into ex uno plures in a hurry . That is , up until recently , immigration was a policy area where the president was able to successfully promise a great deal to his base without paying any kind of major price among swing voters  because what he was promising to activists ( the DREAM Act ) was pretty popular and didnt conflict with his parallel strategy of touting deportation numbers and an allegedly-secured border , because theres broad support for some kind of immigration compromise and most voters arent exactly detail-oriented , and because the G.O.P.s consultants were terrified of contesting the issue . But once the border started to look less secure ( in part , perhaps , because of DREAM-created incentives ) and activists started demanding something much bigger ( the sweeping executive amnesty that the White House seemed poised to offer , than walked back ) , Obamas two-step turned into something that cost him with the base and the middle  effectively undoing one of his most successful first term strategies , emboldening Republicans to criticize his policies rather than just promising compromise or ducking , and opening space between the so-called coalition of the ascendant and the older , whiter voters the Democrats still need to win in , say , Iowa .I think this analysis has some merit ( not surprisingly , since I just spun it ) ; I just dont think it proves immigrations major salience in knocking down the presidents approval ratings and/or influencing this cycle . But well get an interesting test in New Hampshire , where Scott Brown has campaigned heavily on the issue ; if he pulls out an upset , my estimation of immigrations impact on Obamas swoon and 2014s outcomes will go up . And whether it explains a lot or just a little of Obamas struggles , the way the issue has played out over the last 18 months does potentially foreshadow similar/broader difficulties for the Democratic coalition as it moves into the post-Obama era , in ways that Im sure Ill have reason to discuss again ."
-1	"You still encounter people claiming that Obamacare has been a disaster , that more people have lost insurance than gained it , etc. , etc . But the reality is that it has already made a big dent in the number of uninsured ; and the quality of insurance has gone up , too , because canceled policies were canceled because they offered little real protection .Of course , the coming of the law in January 2014 has been a big job-killer .. or maybe not:This is what success looks like ."

-1	"Greg Sargent notes that the midterm election , which was supposed to be a referendum on Obamacare , isnt looking at all like that in practice ; Republican ads denouncing health reform have been dwindling month by month .The reason is fairly obvious , although its not considered nice to state it bluntly : the attack on Obamacare depended almost entirely on lies , and those lies are becoming unsustainable now that the law is actually working . No , there arent any death panels ; no , huge numbers of Americans arent losing coverage or finding their health costs soaring ; no , jobs arent being killed in vast numbers . A few relatively affluent , healthy people are paying more for coverage ; a few high-income taxpayers are paying more in taxes ; a much larger number of Americans are getting coverage that was previously unavailable and/or unaffordable ; and most people are seeing no difference at all , except that they no longer have to fear what happens if they lose their current coverage .In other words , reform is working more or less the way it was supposed to ( except for the Medicaid expansion in non-cooperating states ) .Many of us argued all along that the rights chance to kill reform would vanish once the program was actually in place ; the horror stories only worked as long as the truth wasnt visible . And thats what seems to be happening ."
-1	"Gail Collins : David , I was pretty confident that the United States had Ebola under control until the other day , when it appeared policy-making had devolved to Andrew Cuomo and Chris Christie . Chris Christie , who cant keep bridge traffic moving . Andrew Cuomo , who failed to get his 2012 flu shot until 2013 .David Brooks : This is why were a republic and not a democracy . People running for office should not be making science policy . By the way , Ive been against quarantines and overreaction through this whole thing , but there was a piece in The New Republic a few weeks ago that sobered me . Steven Beutler , an infectious disease specialist , was arguing for a maximalist response . Heres one core point : Medicine can be a very humbling profession , and after more than 30 years of practicing infectious-disease medicine , I have learned that the unanticipated happens all too often , especially where microbes are involved.Gail : Do you think the Ebola hysteria will have any effect on next weeks election ? Theres been a lot of complaint about the administrations ineptitude . But I think the message on Ebola , at least , has been the opposite . Ebola in the United States began deep in the heart of Texas , a state whose health care system is so estranged from the federal government it refuses to accept the opportunity to get its millions of uninsured residents covered under Obamacare .David : Your love of all things Texas is well known . But you have to admit a few things about the place . It is economically vibrant beyond all reckoning . Houston and Dallas are exploding economically while the rest of the country dawdles .Gail : Texas is the last gasp of the Sunbelt boom . It has all the advantages of warm weather , plus an enormous amount of space which makes housing stupendously cheap . It could have done just as well without being politically crazy .But we were talking about Ebola .David : As for Ebola and the election , my pretentious theory is that Ebola is the objective correlative of the campaign .Gail : Youre using big words again .David : If I remember high school English correctly , an objective correlative is an object that gives explicit access to the meaning of vague and insubstantial things , like a mood or an emotion . Its an object that correlates to a mood or emotion or idea . T.S . Eliot made it famous writing about Hamlet .Anyway , the country was already afraid . It felt like the people running things were not quite up to the job . Along comes a disease to perfectly embody that vague sense . That said , I dont think Ebola is swinging too many votes . People are just sour and they are disappointed with the president .Gail : It certainly has been a tough season for President Obama . But before we start blaming him for anything bad that happens next Tuesday , I would like to give him a shout-out for that hug-the-Ebola-nurse photo . Which allows us to recall that when AIDS hit the United States in 1981 , President Ronald Reagan was criminally useless . Never said a word . As Laura Helmuth noted in Slate this week , Reagans press secretary made fun of the idea that the president would ever consider speaking out .David : I totally agree with you on that one . Its not in the presidents job description to be the professional emoter and behavior model , but when he can display some truth by example , he might as well do it .Gail : I know Im preparing my defenses in advance of next week . But I think the American people have been saying they want an effective government , not a smaller government . All the candidates are promising theyre going to end gridlock , but if theres anything weve learned since Obama was elected , its that you dont end gridlock by sending more Tea Party types to Washington .David : I guess I think it is more generalized than that . They just dont trust government to get the job done . At least the federal government . Im struck by how amazingly stable polling has been on the Affordable Care Act . Democrats in swing states dont try to defend it . They just promise to fix it . The relatively good news on the health care front over the past year has done nothing to change minds .Gail : I find it sort of fascinating that the Republican Senate nominee in Iowa , who previously said shed support a law to have federal officials arrested for attempting to implement Obamacare , is marketing herself as the Iowa nice candidate who can work across the aisle .David : I find it shocking that Iowans should steal Minnesotas slogan . Minnesota is the nice state . Missouri is the skeptical state . New Jersey is the brash state . Iowa should be the quiet state .In her defense I think it is possible to arrest federal officials nicely . We call it compassionate conservatism .Gail : O.K. , this is the point at which were morally obliged to start making predictions . Whats yours ?David : I say this with no great confidence , but Im guessing the Republicans pick up eight seats . I think the biggest surprise will be a G.O.P . win in Georgia .Gail : That would make me sad , if only because Michelle Nunn has run such a good race and her opponent has been so terrible . It just seems unjust .My guess is that were not going to know who gets control of the Senate for a while . Some state is going to be so close therell be a recount . And Alaska takes forever to just get the ballots together . Plus Georgia and Louisiana , which will probably go to runoffs , since they require their senators to get a majority of the vote .David : Great ! Why shouldnt the decades most content-less campaign go into overtime ? Im sort of amazed that this election hasnt been about jobs and the economy . It hasnt been about anything but a sort of fatalism .Gail : Theres something about the idea of the fate of the nation hanging on Louisiana that makes me very nervous . I still remember being down there in 1991 , covering the gubernatorial runoff between the Ku Klux Klan wizard David Duke and the deeply corrupt ex-governor Edwin Edwards . The Edwards supporters had those bumper stickers saying : Vote for the Crook. Which , blessedly , the people did .David : Ill take an effective crook over an ineffective honest person any day .Gail : I should mention that at age 87 , Edwards is running for the House of Representatives this year . After getting out of jail , marrying a woman 51 years younger , and starring in a reality TV series . You cant say Louisiana isnt interesting . And if theres a runoff at least then wed be able to spend part of the winter in New Orleans . So much better than next year , when well be spending it in Des Moines .David : I was just in New Orleans last week . I love every street in that city except Bourbon Street , which is filled with terrible pizza places , extremely drunk idiots and teenagers mortified to be walking with their parents .Gong there makes me want to reread my favorite political novel of all time , Robert Penn Warrens All the Kings Men. Trollopes Phineas Finn is second .And dont knock Des Moines . Silence is golden .Gail : Whats the state youre following most closely ? I have to admit Kansas is pretty darned fascinating . If the Republicans have to ferry in any more old party stalwarts to shore up Senator Pat Roberts , theyll be resurrecting Alf Landon .I got a twinge watching Bob Dole campaign so vigorously for Roberts . Do you remember in 2012 when Dole was sitting in the Senate , in his wheelchair , watching his friends refuse to ratify the United Nations treaty on people with disabilities ? Which was based , of course , on the signature bill Dole got passed in 1990 when he was in the Senate .David : Somebody should please explain to me why senators dont ever want to retire . Whats fun about attending Ag Committee hearings when you are 84 ? Maybe the napping opportunities .Gail : I talked with Dole after the treaty vote , and he kept coming back to the fact that both of the Republican Senators from Kansas had voted against ratification . But theres Roberts now , in a deep ditch because he took his constituents so much for granted he didnt even bother to pretend he lived in their state . Dole clearly has a much deeper sense of loyalty .David : I once went to the Dole center in Kansas . Theyve got a sort of museum display about his life . The thing that moved me most was the exercise equipment he used to build himself back into shape after his war injury . He had wasted away to nothing and had to build himself all the way back . Then I got to see the basement where they keep all the presents he had been given by foreign dignitaries during his Senate years . There were carpets , saddles , baseball bats . People give politicians portraits of themselves . I guess thats called knowing your subject .Gail : Its interesting how many elections there are this year where voters seem to despise both candidates . If Floridians were any more alienated by their governors race , theyd have been bringing alligators to the debates .David : I dont think Floridians should be angry or alienated . It doesnt suit them . Among other things , it doesnt go with their pastels .Gail : I dont want anybody to imagine that Im making fun of other states because of my deep satisfaction with New York . Nothing is more humbling than spending a season covering New York politics . Where the phrase not yet indicted is regarded as a compliment .David : If Minnesota is nice and Iowa is quiet , what should New York be : Pompous ? Narcissistic ? I say this lovingly . It is my state too .Gail : Last question . Is there anything about this election thats really surprised you ? I didnt expect to see so much of Mitt Romney on the campaign trail . Do you think hes actually interested in running again ? They say third times a charm .David : Trust me . He isnt running . I think his wife sort of ruled that out . That documentary released after the election revealed him to be an authentically warm and nice guy . If there are three things that dont seem to work in politics these days its authenticity , niceness and warmth . Doesnt fit the national mood ."
-1	"The Kaiser Family Foundation has a new survey ( pdf ) on Obamacare in California , and its full of remarkably good news . For those who havent been following this , CA  with its now-dominant Democratic Party  is where Obamacare was implemented the way it was supposed to be implemented : the website worked pretty well from the beginning , Medicaid expansion was implemented , and the state worked hard on outreach . It was also a place that really needed reform : the uninsured were a high percentage of the population , and an individual market without community rating meant that the mere hint of a preexisting condition was enough to prevent coverage .So it now appears that most of Californias uninsured  58 percent of the total , or well over 60 percent of those eligible ( because undocumented immigrants arent covered ) have gained insurance in the first year . Considering the complexity of the scheme , thats really impressive , and it strongly suggests that next year , once those who missed out have had a chance to learn via word of mouth , California will have gotten much of the way toward universal coverage for legal residents .But theres something else the Kaiser report drives home : most of those gaining coverage are doing so not via the exchanges ( although those are important too ) but via Medicaid . And thats important as an answer to critics of Obamacare from the left .There have always been critics complaining that what we really should have is single-payer , and angry that subsidies were being funneled through the insurance companies . And in principle theyre right ; the trouble was that cutting the insurers out of the loop would have made the plan politically impossible , both because of the industrys power and because of the unwillingness of people with good coverage to take a leap into a completely new system . So we got this awkward public-private hybrid , which I supported because it was what we could get and despite its impurity it dramatically improves many peoples lives .But it turns out that many of the newly insured are in fact being covered under a single-payer system  Medicaid . And as Ive pointed out before,Medicaid is actually the piece of the US system that looks most like European health systems , which cost far less than ours while delivering comparable results .All in all , liberals really should be celebrating . California shows how Obamacare can and should work , and its looking pretty good ."
-1	"These are tough times for opponents of health care reform . They bet everything on a debacle , but Obamacare has failed to fail  and their efforts to deny the increasingly obvious success of the law are beginning to look ridiculous .Oh , and they cant come up with a conservative alternative ; Obamacare IS the conservative alternative , a way to achieve sorta-kinda universal coverage without single payer , and all of its main elements are essential parts of the package .So whats left ? Claims that guaranteed health insurance is an assault on Americas freedom .Bill Gardner at The Incidental Economist offers a rather decorous , mild reply to the people making this argument . Id put it more forcefully : the pre-ACA system drastically restricted many peoples freedom , because given the extreme dysfunctionality of the individual insurance market , they didnt dare leave jobs ( or in some cases marriages ) that came with health insurance . Now that affordable insurance is available even if you dont have a good job at a big company , many Americans will feel liberated  and this hugely outweighs the minor infringement on freedom caused by the requirement that people buy insurance . ( Also , if you dont like the mandate , why not support single payer ? )But no discussion of this latest argument should fail to mention the original insurance-is-slavery campaign  Operation Coffeecup , in which the AMA recruited doctors wives to gather their friends and listen to a recording of Ronald Reagan declaring that Medicare would destroy American liberty .Strange to say , that didnt happen . And Obamacare wont turn into a form of slavery , either . On the contrary , as I said , it will be a liberating force for many Americans ."

-1	"Gail Collins : David , youve been enthusiastic about the Senate race in Kansas , where an independent , Greg Orman , became a surprise front-runner . Now the same kind of thing seems to be happening in South Dakota . Are you excited ?David Brooks : Have you ever heard of negative panic ? In times of chaos or extreme excitement , before a fire or an oncoming tornado , some people act with extreme calm , as if everything is normal . Their brains just dont know how to handle the extreme circumstances so they pretend those circumstances dont exist . Many people die because they dont take the simple evasive action that would save their lives .I am so excited by the prospect of an independent candidate in South Dakota that I am behaving as if everything is normal . I give off the appearance of extreme calm . But deep down Im rippling with excitement . Next to me John Thune and Tom Daschle seem manic .Gail : I may have gotten carried away . I remember now that I recently humiliated myself by announcing how thrilled I was by a Senate candidate debate in Iowa .But weve only got three more weeks of this election season , so you have to humor me . In South Dakota , Mike Rounds , the Republican Senate candidate , was supposed to win . Then he got mired in a scandal . Its one of those extremely complicated matters that we in the media try to summarize with a phrase like allegations of corruption.David : Do you know that South Dakota was the last state among the 48 that I have visited ? Now Ive been there a few times . What impresses me about the place is that the eastern and western sides of the state are rivals with each other . Youd think that there would be so much resentment north/south in the Dakotas that they wouldnt have time for east/west . I guess the winters are long .I dont know why I mention this except that I think people would be more forgiving toward Mike Rounds if there was more of a love-thy-neighbor mentality .Gail : Well , Rounds hasnt run any attack ads because he feels South Dakotans dont like that tone . Although to be fair , until recently he didnt think he had any competition . People who are basically running unopposed love the high road .The Democrat , Rick Weiland , has been running as a populist-liberal , and until recently the national party rewarded him for his principled candidacy by ignoring his race entirely . Then Larry Pressler , a former Republican senator now turned independent , began to get traction . Now anything seems possible .David : I love the fact that Pressler is back , once again disproving the most untrue truism in American literature , that there are no second acts in American life .Gail : Oh my gosh , I totally agree with you . Bill Clinton alone has had about fifteen second acts .David : Pressler is on his seventh or eighth act . The guy was a Rhodes Scholar , a Vietnam vet . He first entered Congress before Jimmy Carter was president . Thats a long time ago . He was also the senator who came off looking good during the Abscam scandal . Heres a passage from a 1980 Washington Post story:Thanks to the F.B.I.s undercover sting operation , there now exists incontrovertible evidence that one senator would not be bought . Preserved among the videotape footage that may be used as bribery evidence against a number of members of Congress , there is a special moment in which Sen. Larry Pressler ( R-SD ) tells the undercover agents , in effect , to take their sting and stick it . Pressler , according to law enforcement sources , was the one approached member of Congress who flatly refused to consider financial favors in exchange for legislative favors , as suggested by undercover agents posing as Arabs . At the time he said he was not aware that he was doing anything quite so heroic.Gail : I do love listening to you read the news . And you brought back Abscam ! Its comforting , at minimum , to know there was at least one senator who didnt immediately buy the phony-sheikh hustle .David : So yes , I guess I have a soft spot for a guy like that who wants to re-enter the Senate . That said , I think it will be hard to stay up in the polls once the other guys set their sights on him .Gail : So we agree South Dakota is  yes !  exciting . And I know you like the idea of electing bipartisan independents .Heres what worries me about that . There are already two official independents in the Senate , Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine . Suppose we wound up with a Senate that was 48-48-4 ? If the independents formed their own little caucus , theyd have the deciding votes on everything . The fate of every bill and nomination would depend on four guys from Kansas , South Dakota , Vermont and Maine . Four people whose states represent less than 2 percent of the American population .David : Are you worried about this because the United States Senate is not a model of legislative excellence ? I of course think the Senate is way more polarized than the country so it would be a good thing to have a little ballast in the center . Even if that ballast does come from extremely even-tempered states .Gail : Do you think South Dakotans will be troubled by the fact that the independent Senate candidate Larry Pressler seems to actually live in Washington , D.C ? At least he rents an apartment in Sioux Falls , which is more than Pat Roberts , the endangered Kansas senator , bothered to do .David : I wished all senators lived in D.C. Congress worked better when its members couldnt fly home every week . I dont think its the time at home that ruins them ; its the airport food .I know people like me are always saying this , but I do think if members of the Senate were here for more than three days at a stretch they would actually learn to like each other a little more . Plus , members of Congress are not primarily in office to directly represent their constituents ; they are in Congress to offer their best judgments on the issues of the day .Gail : Well , sort of . Until the budget or the farm bill comes out , and everybodys trying to figure out what it means to the folks in East Cupcake .We do have a lot of close races that are roiled by residency issues this year . Besides South Dakota and Kansas , theres Louisiana , where Senator Mary Landrieus official state residence is in her parents house . And in Alaska , the Republican Senate candidate is getting criticized for having what might be called shallow Alaskan roots .David : Weve got to start paying these people more . With Washington real estate prices shooting toward N.Y.C . levels , its expensive to maintain a home there and a house back in the home state . I really think this residency business is a crazy issue .Gail : Maybe we could put up dorms . Nice big ones like colleges have for married graduate students .This is the point at which I get nostalgic and recall that in one of the first elections I ever covered , one of the big issues was whether the voting address of the incumbent was actually a North Haven , Connecticut , Burger King outlet .David : I didnt know Chris Christie began his career in Connecticut .Gail : Ach , low blow .But it still seems to me that people are better off choosing between two parties that have reasonably clear , competing agendas  plus the ability , at least in theory , to deliver on some of their promises .David : If one party or another had a total grip on the truth Id agree with you . Hard issues usually require a balancing between competing values and competing legitimate interests . Independents , if they know their job , can help find this balance . If they dont know their job they just waffle in the middle .Gail : Well , I do admit that the last several seasons in Washington have not done a whole lot for my let-the-parties-deliver theory .David : So true .Gail : Maybe the good news from this election season is that Obamacare is fading as an issue . Can you foresee a time when the House will give up voting several dozen times a season to repeal it and actually start working with the other party to fix its weak spots ?I dont want to force your opinion , but maybe I should point out that there are a lot of us who would grab onto a positive response as a tiny glimmer of hope in an otherwise hopeless election season .David : Sorry . I do think health care inflation is declining , which is fabulous news , either because of Obamacare or some other reason . But Im afraid this issue will be with us forever . When Larry Pressler stages his next comeback in 2056 , well still be talking about it ."
-1	"Whenever Barack Obama seems in danger of falling , do we have to hear that George W. Bush made the cliff ?It happened with the economy . For the presidents staunchest defenders , legitimate questions about whether the stimulus was wisely crafted and whether Obamacare was rushed took a back seat to lamentations over the damage that his predecessor had done . Obama wasnt perfect , but at least he wasnt Bush .And with the Middle East , those defenders sometimes turn Bushs epic mistakes into Obamas hall pass . Perhaps he hasnt figured out whats right , but he isnt guilty of the original wrong , which is constantly being litigated anew , as if a fresh verdict on the events of 2003 could alter the challenges and stakes of 2014 .On Tuesday there was another spasm of this . As Congress debated the escalation of airstrikes against Islamic extremists , Representative Lloyd Doggett , a Texas Democrat , digressed to inveigh against the wholly unnecessary Bush-Cheney invasion of Iraq ,  a bell that was rung 11 1/2 years ago and cant be un-rung now .And to judge from my inbox lately and the chatter I overhear , what matters to many of Obamas most stalwart fans isnt whether he erred in the way he spoke of those extremists , turned his attention to them quickly enough or is now confronting them with the correct dose of belligerence : not too little , not too much .At least hes not Bush . He didnt hallucinate weapons of mass destruction , make a spurious case for war or condone torture . I hear so much about Bushs failings and Bushs sins that youd think he were still huddled over a desk in Washington rather than dabbing at a canvas in Texas .Enough . Its true that Obama hasnt replicated Bushs offenses , and its consoling . But it isnt exactly reason for a parade , and it doesnt inoculate him . The culpability that lies elsewhere doesnt relieve the responsibilities that are now his .And not being as bad as someone else is hardly the same as being good . Obama can rise far above Bush and still fall short . The presidency isnt The Voice ( though it is a little like Survivor ) . Youre not judged only in relation to the other performers whove been on stage . Youre judged by how well you respond to the unique circumstances of your time and place  by your ability to clean up the mess , not whether you made it .This not-as-bad-as defense is a pointless partisan tic . Weve seen a lot of it over the course of this presidency and will no doubt see a lot of it during the next , be it Democratic or Republican .The I.R.S . scandal was not as bad as Watergate . ( Nothings ever as bad as Watergate , which serves a nifty historical function as the gold standard of executive malfeasance and mendacity . )The bungled rollout of Obamacare was not as bad as the botched response to Katrina .Its apples and hurricanes , but theyre put in the same basket , in a manner that recalls a child trying to evade punishment by ratting out a sibling for something worse . Dont be mad , Mommy , about Operation Fast and Furious and all those guns that ended up with Mexican drug cartels . Ronnie traded arms for hostages as part of this whole Iran-contra affair !I sometimes like to imagine presidential campaigns waged along these lines and what the candidates not-as-bad-as bumper stickers might say .Fewer Lies Than Nixon. Fewer Sweaters Than Carter. Fewer Interns Than Clinton. Better Speller Than Quayle.It works in the other direction , too , and Obama has definitely suffered plenty of not-as-good-as slings . Former presidents are held up not merely as yardsticks ; theyre rulers used to rap the knuckles of the Oval Offices current inhabitant and beat him over the head .Smack : That Teddy Roosevelt certainly understood the power of the bully pulpit ! Thwack : That L.B.J . really knew how to schmooze ! A president is like a second spouse living in the saintly shadow of a first one who perished too soon .George Santayana famously said that those who dont know history are destined to repeat it . But are those who fixate on it blind to how peculiar the present is , and to the fact that no degree of longing for a lost hero or blaming of a departed villain is going to change what lies ahead ?If were determined to glance back at a figure who flatters Obama , lets really have at it and look all the way to Warren Harding . Golf wasnt his only distraction . He also had a thing for poker . And when it came to seeming and feeling overwhelmed , the 29th president , an Ohio Republican , reputedly confessed to friends that he was lost in the job .By that measure Obama is a rock . But it doesnt make him a boulder ."
-1	"On Monday , I wrote that the apparent stabilization of Obamacare sharpens the political and policy challenge facing the laws critics . Instead of the sort of easy unraveling that some Republicans had convinced themselves was in the offing , I argued ( in a point made rather more forcefully by Ramesh Ponnuru ) that its now much more likely that the only way the things conservatives dislike about Obamacare will ever change or go away is if conservatives actually unite around reforms or a replacement that sustains some of the current laws coverage expansion ( albeit on significantly different terms ) .My sense is that some Republicans half-agree . That is , theyre willing to concede that the party needs an Obamacare replacement thats more serious than some of the G.O.P.s circa-2009 alternatives . But they also think the law will remain so unpopular , and that the number of losers will exceed the number of winners so dramatically , that conservative policymakers will have more room to maneuver , in terms of the initial coverage numbers a replacement might sustain , than my reading of the situation would suggest .The health care reform proposal rolled out by Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal this week offers a specific example of how this perspective cashes out . Unlike some other recent Republican proposals ( most notably , the bill co-sponsored in the Senate earlier this year ) , which promise tax cuts and savings relative to current policy , Jindals proposal explicitly starts with the 2008 baseline , and promises not to tax or spend a dollar more . His proposed reform would convert the open-ended deduction for employer-provided insurance into a flat deduction , extend the same deduction to people outside the employer market , and channel $ 100 billion over ten years to the states to provide for high-risk pools and other measures to help cover people with pre-existing conditions . What it conspicuously wouldnt do is create the kind of tax credit for catastrophic coverage that youll often find in right-of-center health care alternatives  because that would cost money relative to the 2008 baseline , and/or require further disruptions elsewhere in the system . Which means , in turn , that if you replaced Obamacare with Jindalcare in 2017 , youd see a coverage expansion relative to the Bush era , but a large number of the newly-insured would lose coverage without any immediate prospect of regaining it .Jindal was in D.C. yesterday to talk about his plan ( full disclosure , I was there ) , and the Washington Examiners Philip Klein has a good write-up of how he responded to , shall we say , pushback on this point:Jindal was pressed on why he chose to offer a tax deduction for individuals to purchase insurance rather than a refundable tax credit . Supporters of the tax credit approach argue that it would benefit more people , because lower-income Americans dont pay enough taxes for the deduction to be valuable enough to make insurance premiums affordable .He said that he decided on the deduction approach because relying on tax credits would be so costly that it would require tax increases  and Jindal doesnt want his plan to spend more or tax more than the system that existed prior to Obamacares passage . He also argued that credits would cause more disruption to the employer-based market and would be more prone to fraud .He said that whatever amounts of money conservatives were willing to allocate to address a problem , Democrats would always be willing to spend more , so conservatives can not get into a bidding war .Jindal cited previous estimates of similar reform proposals to his own , which he said could reduce family health insurance premiums by $ 5,000 annually and increase coverage by 9 million people relative to the number of people who were covered prior to Obamacare .I dont think conservative health care reform is about saying were going to compete with them in terms of how many people we say have an insurance card ,  he said . Thats not the ultimate goal.So obviously the governor and I have a substantive disagreement here : Like Jindal , Im deeply skeptical of the give everyone a Medicaid card approach to health care reform , but that skepticism pushes me toward supporting a basic catastrophic protection ( and other reforms ) instead , rather than toward just accepting , for the foreseeable future , a health insurance marketplace that prices a lot of working class Americans out of affordable coverage of any sort .But for the purposes of this post , Im more interested in the politics of the debate . Politically , I dont think theres any question that Jindals argument  go back to the pre-Obamacare baseline , expand coverage modestly relative to that  would play well with at least part of the G.O.P . electorate in a primary campaign . For a case , contra myself and Ponnuru , that it could also play pretty well in the general election and in a subsequent legislative battle , heres Ben Domenech , writing in yesterdays edition of his newsletter The Transom: when President Obama sold his health care law to the American people , he sold it to them primarily on the basis of cost . He did this because the polling was so unanimous : people werent demanding massive increased regulation of the insurance marketplace to achieve any particular moral goal about coverage levels or anything of the sort  the vast majority of Americans just cared that their premiums cost too much . So Obama made the case for his law based not on increasing coverage , but on decreasing costs  and along the way , he promised that no one would lose their doctor , their plan , or see worse coverage because of his law . In each case , his case was in line with the polling data on what the American people wanted .But what about making the case for health policy reforms in the post-Obamacare era ? For most center-right health policy experts and opinion-makers , the assumption has taken hold that coverage levels must be sustained or even increased under any comparable reform . They believe the argument in favor of universal coverage has been lost , and that any plan which kicks people off of an entitlement program is doomed to fail , politically .This is an assumption held by most people in Washington and the media . But I wonder how accurate it is . Post-Obamacare polling data on this question is lacking , but given the behavior of so many individuals and entities in reaction to Obamacare its possible that the bulk of Americans still hold the same views they did prior to the laws passage : that they want to retain their current plans , that they dislike disruption in their insurance experience , but that most of all , they want lower costs for themselves , not broader coverage for everybody else .I agree that support for universal coverage has tended to be soft , rising when it seems theoretical and then diminishing when the trade-offs actually present themselves . But my expectation is that with Obamacare in place , the psychology of loss aversion changes this calculus in two ways . First , indirectly  because it seems worse to most people to lose a benefit than to have never enjoyed it , voters will feel more morally uncomfortable supporting a candidate who promises to strip other peoples coverage than they would have felt voting for a candidate who opposed the expansion originally . And second , directly  because over the next few years , even voters who dislike Obamacare and arent getting subsidies are likely to internalize the idea that they now have an additional backstop in the event of job-loss or illness , and so voting to roll the program back completely and start afresh without that backstop will , again , be more unpopular than never creating it in the first place would have been . ( The consistent presence , in most polls , of an anti-Obamacare demographic that prefer changes to outright repeal suggests to me that the idea of maintaining some kind of quasi-universal guarantee has relatively strong appeal . )Id also make a broader point : Yes , the health care law remains unpopular , but it was unpopular in 2012 as well , and the economy was worse , and the Republican nominee still went down to defeat  not least , I would submit , because of the perception that he couldnt be trusted to safeguards the interests of the non-rich . So even if people generally care more about cost than coverage , it still seems quite likely that this fatal impression of the partys priorities would be accentuated , rather than diminished , in a 2016 campaign where the Republican nominee would be quite directly promising to drive the uninsured rate up .My expectation could be confounded , I concede , if the next few years are a true disaster of spiking premiums and stagnant newly-insured numbers . And I would certainly agree with Domenech that the structure of the law is a lot more vulnerable than exuberant liberals seem to think this week .But I also think that in political terms , its actually slightly crazy for Republicans to bet this way given the other options available to them . The Jindal theory , that the right shouldnt bother competing with liberals on certain policy fronts because theyll always be outbid , is generally problematic ( why does his proposal have any coverage expansion , then ? ) but its a particularly odd idea to embrace in a case where the liberal program may not , as even its defenders allow , actually end up delivering the scale of coverage expansion that was expected .By which I mean that if the current enrollment trends persist , there is a good chance that some version of a more catastrophic-focused reform could actually enroll somewhat more Americans in some kind of basic coverage than Obamacare , at a substantially lower cost . ( A preliminary private score of the Senate Republican bill suggested it could get slightly higher coverage numbers , and that was  I believe  using the C.B.O . projections for Obamacare , which may turn out to have been too high . ) Which in turn would offer Republicans an opportunity to effectively outbid the Democrats on enrollment while significantly underbidding them on spending . ( The Democrats could , of course , counter with single-payer  but the G.O.P . should want to provoke that debate ! ) And to pass up that unusual opportunity in favor of a probably-doomed fidelity to a nearly decade-old baseline  well , I suppose it would be very much like the Republican Party Ive come to know and love so well ."
-1	"As we await an official presidential response to last nights Democratic debacle , here are two quotes that seem likely to frame the political classs discussion of how the president might respond . First , from Politico , days before the drubbing , when the White House could still hope for just a modest setback at the polls:Administration officials tell us that Obamas political and policy teams are planning a big counterattack if the Republicans win the Senateintroducing a slate of legislative proposals and executive actions on immigration , infrastructure and early childhood education that are popular with the Democratic base and that he will dare the GOP to oppose .And second , from an anonymous Dem bigwig talking to Business Insider last night:"
-1	"I love voting . I love pretty much everything about it . My polling place is and has been for many years the Alfred E. Smith School , P.S . 163 , an elementary school . The voting booths are arrayed around a mottled , parquet gym floor , and there are always mothers running a bake sale outside to raise money for the school .Up until a few years ago , we voted on huge , metal machines that seemed like relics from the first days of the industrial age . Exercising the franchise was a pleasing combination of sacred civic ritual and theatricality . You waited in line , gave your name , signed the voting rolls , then were ushered behind a curtain that you closed by slamming a red-handled lever big enough to have served as a prop in Modern Times to one side . You flicked more mechanical switches to choose your candidates behind the curtain  a rare oasis of total privacy out in public Manhattan . You could even change your mind and flip them back , at least until the end , when you gave the lever a satisfying slam back the other way , and the curtain slid open . You half-expected the Wizard of Oz to appear .Now that was casting a vote !Thats all changed , thanks to our supposed concern about voter fraud . Since New York instituted its new , computerized voting system , the way things work are as follows : We line up to give our names and get a ballot . We then go a second line for the next available , barely private voting booth  in reality a table with a sort of sneeze guard around three sides . When were finished , we line up a third time to run our ballots through the next available computer , which assures us that our votes have been registered as we wanted , although who can possibly say . Knowing how protected vital American computer systems are against hackers , Im waiting for the Election Day the screen tells me my candidate is stuck in Nigeria , and desperately needs a money order to get home and take office .The whole process not only takes three lines  something New Yorkers just love  and is barely private . Volunteers at the polls can easily see whom you voted for at the computers , and often must run the ballots through the scanners for the more elderly or infirm voters . So much for the sanctity of the ballot . The bake sales are still great , though .The lines were fairly sparse at the Smith school today , which inevitably led me to think back to the very long lines and the wild enthusiasm that imbued our first opportunity to vote for Barack Obama for president , in 2008 .All politics is national now , which made this midterm election yet another referendum on President Obama , and it has turned out to be another overwhelming repudiation of the president , who already suffered one debacle back in 2010 .This appears to have been a baffling rejection to this supremely detached president , whose supporters have been protesting that the public just does not appreciate all he has done  a list that invariably includes Obamacare , a revived stock market and an unemployment mark that has inched slowly downward .What the White House doesnt seem to appreciate is just how little a dent this has made in the devastating loss of wealth , security and opportunity so many Americans have experienced in the last few years . But this administration has also been afflicted almost from the start with the inability to decide just whom it is trying to appeal to .Like Bill Clinton before him , this New Democrat president early on dismissed traditional liberals as professional leftists as his first press secretary once put it . But just a few months ago he also let his new F.C.C . chairman suggest an end to net neutrality , and his secretary of education heartily endorse the decision of a Republican judge ending teacher tenure , in which said judge claimed there are a significant number of grossly ineffective teachers currently active in California classrooms.Well , which is it ? Are you trying to build the new , white-collar Democratic Party or not , and if so , where do you expect these people to come from ?This sort of confusion about practical politics has long bedeviled New Democrats . And in fairness , we did let the president down , after that cool , cool fall day in 2008 . The sorts of sweeping , groundbreaking reforms we were hoping for  the change we could believe in  has never been accomplished from the top down in America , but has always meant a president gathering up the strands of many useful ideas and experiments , and working with the power , and often the hands , feet , elbows and knees , of grass-roots movements at his back .Franklin D. Roosevelts leading advisers , Harry L. Hopkins , Frances Perkins , Harold L. Ickes and Henry A. Wallace , among others , had labored long in the trenches on crucial issues of social welfare , labor rights , and land and farm preservation . The Tennessee Valley Authority came out of a decades-long struggle for public power , by Senator George W. Norris . No one in the Congress or Mr. Obamas cabinet has provided anything like this sort of counsel , or experience .Nor has there been anything like the sorts of longstanding , populist , militant farm and labor movements that put the New Deal over . In the turmoil of the 1930s , worker uprisings literally took over waterfronts , factories , department stores and even the city of Minneapolis . Occupy Wall Street took over Zuccotti Park , then evaporated . It takes more than that  more than casting a vote every couple of years  to make change ."
-1	"Gail Collins : David , its less than five weeks until Election Day . And people are so  um  how would you characterize the mood ?David Brooks : Lets see . Giddy with disinterest . Tingling with unconscious ennui . Quivering with apathy . Id say the public mood is paradoxical .Gail : Yet control of the Senate hangs in the balance ! And its all up to the voters in five to 10 states , which neither you nor I inhabit .David : Im really glad to have been spared the agony of swing state envy . Ive never lived in any state that isnt solidly blue . So Ive never known what it feels like to live in a place that has the excitement of competitive races . Hence I dont feel the lack when that excitement goes away . You , coming from Ohio , are not so fortunate . Do you feel pain , perhaps in your wrists and other joints , watching faraway states get all the attention now that you live in a state of political indifference ? Swing state envy is like a concussion , not to be underestimated . I think I may start wearing a purple wrist-band as a sympathy statement .Gail : Our big New York news was that Gov . Andrew Cuomo , whos up for re-election , found it necessary to go to Afghanistan this week . He sort of spun it as an effort to learn more about homeland security . But I honestly think you can do that in the homeland .David : Im presuming this was not a hiking the Appalachian Trail sort of thing . Maybe he went to curry favor with the Pashtun population in Rye . Or for the golfing .Gail : Meanwhile his opponent , whose name recognition is limited to his immediate family , reprised that old Lyndon Johnson Daisy ad where the little girl is picking petals off a flower and then suddenly  countdown to Armageddon ! In this version , when the nuclear bomb goes off , Andrew Cuomos face comes out of the cloud .Did not expect an ad about atomic warfare in the New York gubernatorial race . Possible high point of the political week for me . How about you ? I know youve been taking the occasional gander at the big Senate races . What strikes you as interesting ?David : First the money . Theres been a ton of it , more than $ 228 million by outside groups alone so far . But the surprise in this post-Citizens-United era is that the Democrats are winning the money race so easily . I knew that the Democrats were the party of the rich plutocrats , but I didnt realize how big the lead was . In North Carolina , pro-Democratic groups have a spending lead , $ 13 million to $ 8 million . In Iowa , the Democrats lead $ 9 million to $ 6 million . In Colorado , Democrats lead $ 10 million to $ 5 million . And so on in most states . If this continues Democrats are going to start loving that decision .Gail : I hope it keeps going like this . Id love to watch Mitch McConnell and John Boehner demand that we do something about the poison of super PACs.Meanwhile , on the issues front , Ive been fascinated by how much Republicans have come to love contraception . Really , if they get any more enthusiastic theyre going to start passing out condoms at the debates .David : Or wearing them on their heads like Howie Mandel .Gail : Ive heard several Republican Senate candidates announce that they wanted to see birth control pills sold over the counter . This usually starts with a question about Obamacare  and the requirement that employers cover contraceptives in their health insurance plans . Then the Republican says that if birth control pills were sold like aspirin or Tums , theyd be much cheaper . Which may be true , although having them paid for by your insurance is certainly a better deal .David : Thats clearly true . Im struck , though , by how much the Democrats war-on-women charge against the G.O.P . doesnt seem to be working . In the last Times poll , women were split down the middle , supporting Republicans almost as much as Democrats , 42-43 .Gail : They were still more Democratic-leaning than men . And I do think its working in some races , particularly the ones where the Republican candidate supported the personhood amendment . You know , the one that declares all fertilized eggs have the full rights of a human being .That came up in the Iowa Senate debate , which I am slightly embarrassed to admit I watched from beginning to end .David : Wow . You do have swing state envy . Are you listening to reports on corn prices too ?Gail : Iowa debates are always worthwhile . I enjoy the moment when the fiscal conservative calls for less federal spending , and then is forced to make it clear that underwriting the manufacture of corn-based ethanol does not count as wasteful .David : My problem with the ethanol subsidies is purely selfish . You used to be able to drive around Iowa and see some crop diversity . Now its corn , corn , corn . I bet that even the field of dreams is covered with corn . Its tedious .Gail : Theres been a growing attempt on the part of Republicans to bring ISIS into the campaign . Most of the ads Ive seen dont have a coherent theme . Its like , When terrorists were beheading Americans in Syria , Senator X supported the Obama administration and also missed a public hearing of the Veterans Affairs Committee.David : Im just glad to see any foreign policy in this election . We should have at least some form of national debate on ISIS . I guess this is also a Republican effort to nationalize the election . As observers like Sean Trende have noted , earlier in the campaign there was a disjunction between the fundamentals and the polls . The fundamentals  the presidents low approval ratings  suggest this should be a big Republican year . But the polls were much closer . Many Democratic candidates were hanging in there , even in states Romney carried . Over the past month the polls have moved slightly toward the fundamentals  that is in a slightly Republican direction .Gail : People are so angry at Barack Obama . Their ire seems to be mainly about the economy , yet compared to many other countries , the United States is doing pretty well economically . Im happy to accept the theory that people are angry because of income inequality and the struggling middle class . But the solution to that wouldnt be electing a Congress thats determined to cut federal spending . Youd just wind up with more laid-off state employees , highway construction workers , even schoolteachers .Want to explain that to me ?David : Its possible that people dont think theyre getting their moneys worth . It could be theyre not crazy about boondoggles like ethanol or gubernatorial trips to Afghanistan . Its possible that they think they could spend money more wisely than Congress does . Cant imagine how they could leap to that conclusion .Gail : Well , thats Congress . But theyre trying to make it all about the president . Im expecting that Georgia voters will soon be seeing ads in which Michelle Nunns picture morphs into Barack Obama .David : What strikes me about this is that the movement is similar across many races , suggesting that there is a national dynamic in place . That makes sense . Over the past five midterms weve pretty much seen national dynamics in place most of the time . There was a wave for one party or another . This year that should favor Republicans , who are trying to build the election around national issues , not local candidates .Gail : Do you think these elections matter ? Theres a lot of sentiment that they dont  that if the Republicans take over the Senate , therell be the same stalemate weve got now . That it might even make it easier for the Democrats in 2016 , because therell still be gridlock and the Republicans will be more clearly to blame .David : Im simple-minded . I think winning is better than losing . Remember , once an incumbent gets in , he or she is likely to stay there for a long time . I dont think Democrats should be pre-rationalizing this years results .Gail : Me neither . Although it would be pretty interesting if the Republicans won control of the Senate , and we got to spend two years watching them complain about the evils of the filibuster .David : I cant imagine much legislation will be passed either way . After Obamacare , which was signed into law in March of 2010 , I cant think of a major piece of legislation that has passed in any of the last four years , and I suppose well go another two in the same stagnation .Gail : You must be forgetting the Responsible Helium Administration and Stewardship Act .But about these elections  I admit that I am jealous of the big swing states . If I was in Iowa or Alaska or North Carolina , Id be obsessed with the senate race . Id talk about it all the time , and people would run away when they saw me coming .David : Youve got it bad .Gail : Here in New York , everythings pretty much preordained . Except in Staten Island , where the Republican congressman who threatened to throw a TV reporter over a Capitol balcony might be in trouble .David : Is that because TV reporters are so light ? Throwing a print reporter would be way more impressive .Gail : Well , he failed to follow through . Maybe his constituents are irked that he was all show and no throw . But hes also under multiple indictments for perjury and tax evasion . And yet his defeat is not a foregone conclusion .David : Id think a perjury record would be a plus . Practice makes perfect ."
-1	"Over at Talking Points Memo , they seem bemused by the violent reaction on the right to any suggestion that Obamacare is working as well as all the evidence suggests it is . Josh Marshall and Ezra Klein both made a fairly obvious point : Kathleen Sebeliuss resignation was almost surely timed to follow good news , so that her departure wouldnt be easy to spin as part of a narrative about failed reform . The right , however , went ballistic  not so much expressing skepticism over the good enrollment numbers and the encouraging survey data as expressing total outrage and bewilderment that anyone believes the good news . On the right they know , just know , that its a total disaster .Whats interesting about this is that conservative health wonks , however much they may like to spin facts , know better : even on the right , everyone who knows anything about the subject has been telling people not to expect a collapse , a death spiral , whatever , and even suggesting that Republicans may need to accept that much of Obamacare is irreversible . But not many people in that camp read , say , Avik Roy ; theyre getting their information from Fox News and Rush , and they hear nothing but tales of disaster .But why would they place so much faith in these sources ? These are , after all , the same sources that told them that Romney was going to win big , that we were headed for hyperinflation , and much much more . How can such experiences not have instilled at least a bit of doubt ?Well , we basically know the answer . One thing I learned from reporting on the Madoff affair was the term affinity fraud : people are easily duped by con men who seem to be like them , to be their kind of people . What Fox , Rush etc . do is build a cultural and emotional bond with their audiences , based mainly on who they dislike and attack . And that bond induces those audiences to believe that what comes from these sources is the obvious truth , never mind what those arrogant elitists with their facts and data may be saying . ( Im turning into Stephen Colbert as we speak . )Anyway , its quite a sight to behold ."
-1	"Three blog posts and a column should probably suffice to cover the debate over Obamacare and work incentives , but I dont want to let the topic drop without first stepping back and talking about the actual health policy disagreement here . My column and posts last week criticized what struck me as a kind of insouciance from liberals about this issue , shading into a post-work utopianism that doesnt wrestle with what , in practice , the decline of work is actually likely to mean for issues of class , mobility , and social equality . But its also important to recognize that for many liberal writers , the controlling assumption here is not anti-work or pro-work . Its just pro-universal health care as a basic standard for a decent society , with the consequences taken as they come .I would prefer that this perspective was accompanied by less chatter about how the only people working less because of Obamacare will be The Most Hardworking Amazing Moms in America , and fewer suggestions that its indecent and unpatriotic to worry about how welfare policy influences economic decision-making . But stripped of the Panglossian window dressing , its entirely reasonable to believe that some public goods are too important to be withheld just because they might have a few perverse consequences . ( I can certainly think of a few policies I would support even if they took a bite out workforce participation . )At least where the center-left is concerned , then , if you dig deep enough into the work-incentives debate youll hit the same old argument about the importance of universal comprehensive insurance . Thats why you keep seeing Obamacares defenders argue that the laws income effect  where people work less because theyre getting insurance benefits at a much-reduced cost  is mostly fine , because we dont want people having to work to afford a basic good like health insurance . And its why , when they talk about the substitution effect  the way the the subsidy phase-out creates an effective marginal tax that discourages working longer hours or taking a higher-paying job  they usually concede the existence of a problem , but then argue that the best way to solve it would be to extend Obamacares existing benefit further up the income ladder , or make it universal  in each case , at an expense that conservatives would inevitably oppose .Whats being implicitly ruled out , in both cases , is the possibility that government should be subsidizing insurance , but also subsidizing less of it than Obamacare does , and that the scope of the existing insurance model is making both the income and the substitution effects larger than they need to be . This is basically the theory behind the most plausible conservative alternative  a flat subsidy for catastrophic coverage  to the health care law we actually got . And though liberals mostly reject it , I think its a theory worth entertaining even if you believe absolutely in the kind of redistribution inherent in Obamacare  because even granted the pro-redistribution premise its still not obvious that subsidizing comprehensive insurance is the best way to go about it .Think about it this way . The welfare state delivers a basket of subsidies to lower-income Americans . Some of these subsidies take the form of cash , and some are direct subsidies for various goods ( food , housing , health insurance ) . Some are tied to work  the earned income tax credit is the notable example  and some of them are not . Pre-Obamacare , the main subsidy for health insurance was tied to work , which both conservatives and liberals tend to regard as a less-than-ideal design ; it was also open-ended and regressive , making it a lousy deal for low-income Americans , period .So we can agree that we should be transitioning away from that model . But theres no necessary reason why , in the course of that transition , we should just set the new health care share of the low-income basket at the levels suggested by the existing insurance model , when that model plainly isnt delivering value for those dollars overall . Maybe , instead , it would make more sense to take some of the money that Obamacare spends chasing the goal of comprehensive coverage and spend it , say , on giving single workers some of the same E.I.T.C . benefits as families . Or on a larger child tax credit . Or on a straightforward payroll tax cut . Or  to pick a liberal cause , instead of a reform conservative idea  new experiments in universal pre-kindergarten !If severing health insurance from work inevitably reduces workforce participation , that doesnt mean we shouldnt gradually sever it , and seek to subsidize insurance in a different way . But it means that we should think seriously about what else we should be doing , and whether we should be spending as much as Obamacare spends on insurance when there are other transfers that might not offer as many work disincentives , might give a stronger boost to upward mobility , and might do more long-term good .On the last point , I dont want to rehearse the entire debate about catastrophic versus comprehensive coverage , and the good that health insurance does or doesnt do . Ill just note two recent items that I think are relevant to this debate . The first is a big Times story , running today:One of the largest and most meticulous studies of mammography ever done , involving 90,000 women and lasting a quarter-century , has added powerful new doubts about the value of the screening test for women of any age .It found that the death rates from breast cancer and from all causes were the same in women who got mammograms and those who did not . And the screening had harms : One in five cancers found with mammography and treated was not a threat to the womans health and did not need treatment such as chemotherapy , surgery or radiation .The study , published Tuesday in The British Medical Journal , is one of the few rigorous evaluations of mammograms conducted in the modern era of more effective breast cancer treatments . It randomly assigned Canadian women to have regular mammograms and breast exams by trained nurses or to have breast exams alone .Researchers sought to determine whether there was any advantage to finding breast cancers when they were too small to feel . The answer is no , the researchers report .The second is a study published this month in the Journal of Development Economics . Heres the executive summary:We examine the impact of removing user fees for healthcare in rural Ghana using data from a randomized experiment that includes rich information on objective measures of child health status . We find that free care increased use of formal healthcare shifting care seeking away from informal providers , with particularly strong effects for children who were anaemic at baseline . There was no health effect on the intervention population taken overall . [ emphasis mine  R.D . ] However , consistent with the utilization findings , there were health improvements amongst those with anaemia initially . Further benefits included a large reduction in health spending , with the effect greater at higher levels of the medical spending distribution . Free care was found to have no influence on a range of malaria prevention behaviours or on the incidence of self-reported illness , suggesting that ex-ante moral hazard is unlikely to be a concern in this particular setting .If you want a reason to doubt the wisdom of redistribution-via-insurance , these are the places to start : In the evidence , widespread and accumulating , that what we spend on medical treatment  and what the government spends for us  does not have a clear connection to how healthy we are and how long we live .This evidence does not make the case for excluding health insurance , and the financial protection it supplies , when you design a safety net . But it does make a case against Obamacare as designed , especially given some of the trade-offs that design requires . And it makes a positive case for deploying resources somewhat differently , focusing more on the nexus of work and money income , and spending less on a benefit that can only be spent in ways that dont seem to be producing the promised results ."
-1	"Sorry about blog silence  real life intruded , plus I did have to write a column . But I shouldnt let the day pass without mentioning the latest big Obamacare news . Final enrollment for 2014 , we now know , will be more than 8 million . The age mix has also improved , with more young people signing up at the end ; as Jonathan Cohn points out in the linked article , the age mix in Obamacares first year is now just about identical to the age mix in Romneycares first year . Goodbye , death spiral .How did enrollment manage to surge so impressively despite the initial debacle of healthcare.gov ? Obviously they fixed the website ; but the broader issue , as Sarah Kliff rightly points out , is that being uninsured is truly terrible . Uninsured Americans really , really wanted coverage , and they werent ready to give up .Kliff doesnt make this point too explicitly , but this diagnosis has another crucial implication : the benefits of Obamacare , for all its imperfections , are immense . Millions of people who lived extremely anxious lives now have far more security than before . Compared with those benefits , the complaints of some already insured people that they have less choice of doctors than before , or that theyre no longer allowed to retain minimalist plans , look like whining . ( And of course not one of the more serious-sounding stories about soaring premiums and all that has held up under scrutiny . )And speaking of whining , the GOP response seems to be to make every possible insinuation to the effect that the numbers are somehow fraudulent . I actually dont think theres a game plan here ; their whole position was premised on the inevitable collapse of health reform , and they have no plan B .All around , as Cohn says , a very good day for reform ."

-1	"The good news about Obamacare so far shouldnt be considered disputable . Enrollments really are above target ; multiple independent surveys show a sharp drop in the uninsured population ; health care cost growth really has slowed dramatically , whatever the reason ; the newly insured are generally satisfied with their coverage . If you want to insist that big problems lie ahead , fine ( but please explain ) , but the facts so far are pretty good .But what Im getting  and what you get whenever you suggest that things are going OK  is an outpouring , not so much of disagreement , as of fury . People get red-in-the-face angry , practically to the point of incoherence , over the suggestion that its not a disaster .Whats that about ? Partly it may be Obama derangement syndrome . I was struck by mail I received after my last column accusing me of shilling for Obama and refusing to admit what a disaster hes been  when the column didnt so much as mention the guy . Obamacare was a label stuck on the Affordable Care Act by its opponents , to tie the president to the disaster to come ; now theyre livid that it , and he , are turning out OK .Partly it may be general hatred for any kind of program that helps the less fortunate , especially if they happen to be , you know , not white . Such programs must be disasters  dont bother me with evidence .And partly , I suspect , theres now an element of shame . If this thing is actually working , everyone who yelled about how it would be a disaster ends up looking fairly stupid .But , you know , sometimes looks dont deceive ."

-1	"Jonathan Cohn looks at the evidence so far on health insurance premiums , and finds things not too bad:Coverage will get more expensive for the majority of consumers , as it almost always does . Changes in premiums will vary enormously , from state to state and from plan to plan . But , overall , the 2015 premiums increases will not be significantly worse than they were in the past . They might even be a little better .Charles Gaba finds much the same . Furthermore , theres a clear trend within the trend : states that did their best to make Obamacare work are also delivering good deals to their residents . California is heading for an increase of only 4.2 percent . On the other hand , things are not looking too good in Florida:In Florida , by contrast , the Republicans in charge did very little to promote the law and , at times , seemed determined to undermine it . Never was this more clear than in 2013 , when the legislature passed and Governor Rick Scott signed a bill that suspended state governments ability to reject excessive premium increases .Overall , yet more evidence that this reform works wherever politicians let it work ."

-1	"One of the truly amazing ( and disheartening ) things about the Great Recession and its aftermath has been the continuing insistence of many economists that its somehow a supply-side slump , driven by the evils of Obamacare or something . This tends to come from people who view stagflation in the 1970s as having permanently refuted all things Keynes .So I guess its worth pointing out repeatedly that the recent slump shows all the hallmarks of a demand-side shock ; in particular , rising unemployment has been associated with falling inflation  the opposite of stagflation . Heres an international comparison I happen to have produced for other purposes , comparing the change in unemployment from 2007 to 2013 with the change in inflation over the same period:An interesting point : if you fit a linear equation to these points , the slope of the implied Phillips curve is -0.16  which is the same number the influential recent paper by Kiley ( pdf ) finds using combined time series and cross-section on US metropolitan areas . Just a coincidence , probably , but I had expected the international relationship to look weaker ."

-1	"SO far , opponents of the Affordable Care Act have lost every major battle to repeal or invalidate it . Some of them are now urging the courts to interpret the health reform law in a way that would guarantee its failure . This is a significant threat  potentially as grave as the previous main legal challenge to the law , which the Supreme Court rejected , 5 to 4 , in 2012 . If the new effort succeeds , it would create total chaos .Having failed to undo the individual mandate to buy health insurance , opponents now claim that , under the law , subsidies for low- and moderate-income Americans to buy insurance may be paid only in those states  currently 14  that have set up their own online insurance exchanges . This would torpedo a central goal of the law : the expansion of coverage .At first , those of us who support Obamacare thought these claims were a joke . On July 22 , the federal appellate court in Richmond , Va. , rejected one such claim , but the same day , astonishingly , the federal appellate court for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled , 2 to 1 , in favor of the plaintiff in a similar case , Halbig v. Burwell . Similar challenges are working their way through courts in two other circuits .Last Thursday , the entire United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit put aside that 2-1 ruling , agreeing to hear the case en banc on Dec. 17 . But now the opponents of Obamacare are asking the Supreme Court to immediately hear an appeal of the Richmond decision , and to pre-empt the full District of Columbia court from hearing the case .The legal challenges say that a provision in the law that references the payment of credits to people who enroll through an Exchange that is established by a State means that credits are not available in the 36 states that have decided to have the federal government manage their exchanges for them .We are economists , not lawyers . But we note that the statute , while vague at points , confirms , when read in its entirety , that tax credits are to be available on all the exchanges , nationwide . The law specifically instructed the secretary of health and human services to create and manage the exchanges for states that chose that option . And when the law was passed , everyone involved in the laws passage understood that this directive vested federal exchanges with the same mission and authority as state-mandated exchanges .The expansion of coverage rests on interlocking elements . The law bars insurers from denying coverage to people with pre-existing medical conditions , dropping coverage when people develop costly illnesses , and charging discriminatory premiums . By themselves , these provisions would encourage people to delay buying insurance until they became ill , causing premiums to skyrocket . So to keep premiums affordable , the law requires nearly everyone to buy insurance , and offers low- and moderate-income people financial help  in the form of refundable tax credits . If both the sick and the healthy buy insurance , premiums can be kept within reason .Limiting tax credits to the 14 states that manage their own exchanges ( along with the District of Columbia ) would destroy this careful architecture . Over five million people receive coverage through federal exchanges  two-thirds of all those covered through exchanges and 40 percent of those newly insured by the act . The best estimates suggest that out-of-pocket costs to typical enrollees of the least-expensive plans available in federally facilitated exchanges would soar to 23 percent of household income , from 3 percent  and to 28 percent of income , from 6 percent , for those in the second least-expensive plans . Households would lose about $ 36 billion in tax credits that help make insurance affordable . Some 6.5 million fewer people would be insured . The federal exchanges could collapse , because they would be left with sick patients , saddled with costly premiums .The record is unambiguous : Congress , in 2010 , understood and endorsed the links connecting the sale of insurance , the requirement to carry insurance and the financial aid to make it affordable . Opponents who lost in the democratic process are now seeking to vitiate the law through a perverse reading of it .If the full District of Columbia Circuit takes up the case , it should reject this sophistry . Meanwhile , the Supreme Court should wait to see what the lower courts do before deciding whether to intervene . Whatever one thinks of the Affordable Care Act , it is absurd to argue that its drafters intended to make insurance unaffordable ."

-1	"Kathleen Sebelius was known for her patience and cool under savage attack by Republicans , who treated her as a stand-in for the health law . She sat through hearings calmly reciting talking points while they fumed and fulminated for their audience .But that turned out to be one of her biggest liabilities , and helps explain why the Obama administration is eager to replace Ms. Sebelius , who said yesterday that she would resign her post as Health and Human Services Secretary . What the health law needed in its first years was a cheerful , populist warrior who could laugh at the truly ridiculous distortions and lies Republicans invented about it , and roar back with the truth . Instead , she came across as a mild technocrat . She never emerged from the defensive crouch she assumed after the laws calamitous debut . It was one thing for Ms. Sebelius to stumble when Jon Stewart mercilessly made fun of her departments non-functional website on The Daily Show . That was her responsibility , after all , and there were absolutely no good excuses for why she hadnt better supervised a program on which rested the reputation of the Obama administration  and more broadly , of governments role in the health marketplace .But the website problems were essentially gravy to Republicans , who were much more concerned about the laws most basic premise : using the levers of government to vastly expand heath coverage . She should have been far better prepared for the public fight over people who had to change their health insurance policies because of the law . In October , at a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing , Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee misleadingly described an NBC News report to make her case .What do you say to NBC News , who says millions are going to lose their coverage ?  she asked the secretary .Ms. Sebeliuss tepid , meandering response : In all deference to the press corps , many of whom are here today , I think its important to be accurate about whats going on , and I would defer again to the president of the [ Florida ] Blues plan , who said people will have ongoing coverage , they will be offered new plans , and 50 percent of the people in the market right now will qualify for federal coverage.That was accurate , as far as it went , but it put people to sleep , and Ms. Blackburn drove right over her answer . Imagine if instead Ms. Sebelius had thrown the question right back : NBC is wrong , congresswoman , and so are you . No one is being denied coverage millions are getting it for the first time , thanks to this law . Please stop scaring the public , because its much better now than when insurance companies could cancel people on a whim  and did , by the thousands , every year.Thats a fantasy answer and its unlikely that Ms. Sebeliuss successor , Sylvia Matthews Burwell , will take that tone , either . No one in the White House lit a fire under Ms. Sebelius because the administration , including its leader , is set on simmer instead of boil , and seems to have internalized Republican criticism .As Politico pointed out , President Obama ran through a list of accomplishments at a Houston fundraiser on Wednesday and didnt even mention his own health law . Democrats would rather talk about what they cant accomplish  a higher minimum wage , equal pay for women , or immigration reform  than what they did accomplish . As long as they remain so reticent , Ms. Sebeliuss departure wont change a thing ."

Consumers who begin to apply by March 31 will have until mid-April to finish .Relatedly , according to the Kaiser Health Tracking Poll for March , substantial shares of the uninsured population dont realize that the deadline to sign up for health insurance is fast approaching .As the clock ticks down on open enrollment for new coverage options under the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) , the latest Kaiser Health Tracking Poll finds that six in ten of the uninsured are unaware of the March 31 deadline to sign up for coverage . When reminded of the deadline and the fine for not getting covered , half of those who lack coverage as of mid-March say they plan to remain uninsured . Meanwhile , four in ten of the uninsured are still unaware of the laws subsidies to help lower-income Americans purchase coverage , and half dont know about the laws expansion of Medicaid."

One congressional aide explained that its difficult to come up a replacement , because it would probably end up looking a lot like the A.C.A . :If you want to say the further and further this gets down the road , the harder and harder it gets to repeal , thats absolutely true ,  the aide said . As far as repeal and replace goes , the problem with replace is that if you really want people to have these new benefits , it looks a hell of a lot like the Affordable Care Act .  To make something like that work , you have to move in the direction of the ACA . You have to have a participating mechanism , you have to have a mechanism to fund it , you have to have a mechanism to fix parts of the market."
-1	"IT is no wonder the Obama administration branded its signature health care legislation the Affordable Care Act . For many Americans the basic problem with medicine  health insurance and health care  is that it has simply become too expensive , especially in a sluggish economy .As Americans begin signing up this week to buy insurance , they will begin to test the legislations tantalizing promise to make health financially viable . Will the policies deliver care at manageable prices , or will affordable seem like a hollow promotion ?That probably depends a lot on patients needs , where they live and  importantly  their preconceptions of what health insurance is supposed to do , experts say . The insurance marketplaces , or exchanges , will sell four different levels of plan  bronze , silver , gold and platinum  with the more expensive plans offering the most extensive benefits . And while premiums for the low-end plans may be relatively cheap , they still require significant out-of-pocket payments , in the form of co-payments and deductibles that could add up to more than $ 6,000 a year .The perception of cost will vary a lot ,  said Dan Mendelson , the chief executive of the consulting firm Avalere Health and a former associate director for health at the federal Office of Management and Budget .Mr. Mendelson predicted that the plans would be welcomed by people who had wanted to be insured but couldnt obtain or afford insurance because of pre-existing conditions , for example , and for low-income earners who would qualify for heavy subsidies for premiums . For some people it will be free , and that is a pretty good value ,  he said .But the required outlays might seem like a lot of cash to healthy families who previously did without insurance . And they could be downright shocking to patients who last had insurance a decade ago , when health plans tended to require little if any patient payments .More of the cost responsibility is being shifted to patients , and more to patients with serious chronic illness ,  Mr. Mendelson said , noting that the silver plans , the second cheapest , are intended to cover only about 70 percent of a patients medical costs . This is different from the concept of insurance weve been carrying around for a long time . So people who sign up for insurance thinking all will be covered are in for some surprises.Elisabeth Benjamin , vice president for health initiatives at the Community Service Society of New York , says that  perceptions aside  the exchange plans she has vetted in New York State provide consumers a good deal . For a number of years , the group has operated a hot line to help patients troubleshoot their medical bills ; 45 percent of callers are uninsured .The premium prices are reasonable  for some people were talking about as much as my cable bill ,  she said . Yes , there are high co-pays , but theres also a cap ,  she added . We now have people come to us owing $ 50,000 or $ 150,000 . So if the worst-case scenario is you pay $ 5,500 , you wont go bankrupt over that.Health experts also point out that the larger patient payments required under policies developed for the Affordable Care Act are increasingly a feature of private health care insurance as well .We are going through a period of revolution in what health insurance is , from more comprehensive to less comprehensive ,  said Drew Altman , president of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation . In 2006 , he said , only about half of employer-provided insurance plans had any deductibles ; now 78 percent do .Insurers impose co-payments and deductibles as an alternative to raising premiums , which are often more tightly regulated . But many health economists approve of the practice because even a small co-pay can push patients to price shop for cheaper care , studies show .The goal of the new legislation is to make sure everyone has decent health insurance , but that ideal will come at a cost for many Americans . Even though the White House celebrated the fact that premiums released this week by the exchanges in 36 states proved lower than anticipated , those premiums vary tremendously depending on where you live , your age and which plan you choose . For example , the monthly premium for a low-end silver plan for a 40-year-old runs about $ 300 in many places , but as high as nearly $ 700 in parts of New York . And monthly premiums are more than $ 600 for 60-year-olds in some states , although a few states , like New York , charge the same rate regardless of age .And perhaps more important , all of the plans have significant deductibles and co-payments . Silver plans often do not kick in until the patient has spent $ 2,000 ; many states require patients to cover 20 percent of hospital costs and some drugs  although that cost-sharing is capped at $ 6,350 per individual , or $ 12,700 per family , and effectively less for low-income patients .The Affordable Care Act also includes tens of millions of dollars in spending for patient navigators , who will help patients choose the plan that best suits their needs , and their pocketbooks .Still , a $ 2,000 deductible is high compared with plans provided by employers , where the average annual deductible is $ 1,135 , Dr. Altman said .For those who balk at the new bills , it is useful to remember that those high co-payments are largely a function of the uniquely high price of medical services in the United States  everything from drugs to scans to operating room time .In a country where even minor medical procedures cost two or three times more than elsewhere in the developed world , cost-sharing is far more likely to be a burden . A healthy 60-year-old in California with a chronic condition like asthma who needs little more than asthma medicine and an outpatient hernia operation could easily pay $ 7,000 in premiums plus a $ 2,250 deductible plus $ 3,000 for the 20 percent hospital co-pay . When my husband recently developed a blood clot in his leg after a bicycling injury , the generic heparin shots to treat the condition cost $ 1,400 at the pharmacy . Though the medicine is nothing new , our insurer considered it a specialty drug because of its price . Under some states silver plans , that would require a 50 percent , or $ 700 , co-pay before getting this potentially lifesaving treatment .Does that seem affordable , or not ?"
-1	"The health care ads being run by Americans for Prosperity  one of the many frantically waving arms of the Koch brothers  are a gift to fact checkers everywhere . Because they deliberately twist the truth to persuade people to stop supporting Obamacare ,  they have become a machine for producing Pinocchios ,  the mendacity rating system used by Glenn Kessler at The Washington Post .In todays installment , Mr. Kessler gave two Pinocchios ( out of four ) to three A.F.P . ads that went up this week . He dinged the ad below for falsely claiming that health insurance premiums are up by 90 percent in New Hampshire .And he criticized this series of ads for suggesting that hundreds of thousands of people in Michigan and Colorado lost their insurance because of the Affordable Care Act , without pointing out that many of those policies were later extended or renewed .Those Pinocchios are fine as far as they go . But since this is an editorial-page blog , we can go a little further than Mr. Kessler and toss many more long noses at the Koch ads . ( Does this dial go to 11 ? )Whats truly erroneous about all these ads ( the full series of which is available on the A.F.P . website , if you have the fortitude ) isnt so much what they say as what they never say . They give viewers the impression that all the pre-existing problems with the health insurance system are the fault of Mr. Obamas law , never bothering to explain how bad things have been for decades .For example , its true that health insurance premiums will be going up for some people under the new system , in most cases because they will have better coverage . But premiums for private insurance have been rapidly escalating for years , far beyond inflation . Since 2003 , they went up by 80 percent , according to the Kaiser Family Foundation , nearly three times as fast as wages and inflation . And the ads never mention the millions who will now get insurance coverage for free or extremely low cost because of the programs subsidies . Those people arent the Kochs intended audience .Similarly , insurance companies used to routinely cancel individual policies , sometimes because the policy holders got sick , or because the companies decided not to do business in a state or region anymore . They cant do that now . But the ads never mention that , instead falsely suggesting that vast numbers of ordinary people have been left without coverage because of the law .As Politico reported yesterday , a new study says that millions of the so-called cancelled policies under the Affordable Care Act ( which were actually policy upgrades ) would have been cancelled anyway by the policyholders . Most people who have individual policies dont keep them for longer than a year , either because they join a new employers plan or change their own policies .Thats the kind of context you will never get in a Koch ad , whether or not the texts of the ads are literally correct . The billionaires behind this effort are on a crusade to end Democratic control of the Senate and ultimately to discredit the idea that government can improve peoples lives through a social program . Context just gets in their way ."
-1	"The Congressional Budget Office said yesterday that the Affordable Care Act should be cheaper than originally projected .Via The New RepublicIn February , the last time CBO addressed these issues comprehensively , it predicted that the net cost of the laws coverage provisions would be about $ 1.4 trillion over ten years . Now , CBO says , its likely to be about $ 1.3 trillion , or $ 100 billion less .Its actually the latest in a series of revisions , each one suggesting the law would cost less money than the previous projection had suggested . And why this latest change ? It doesnt appear to be because the law will reach fewer people . CBO now expects slightly more people to end up with health insurance , at least over the long run . The CBOs primary explanation for lower costs is that health insurance premiums on the new exchanges  what the administration calls marketplaces are lower than CBO had originally expected they would be ."
-1	"It has been a week since opponents of health-care reform accused the Obama administration of conspiring with the Census Bureau to undercount the number of uninsured Americans in an attempt to make the Affordable Care Act look more successful than it really is .It was one of the wackier attacks on the A.C.A . And yet it has gained some traction , of sorts . No one in his or her right mind is endorsing the conspiracy theory . But in the aftermath of the accusations , a handful of senators are calling on the bureau to modify its survey method .That would be fine , if they were advocating for true advancements in the bureaus already impressive statistics-gathering . Unfortunately , they seem more intent on satisfying the conspiracy theorists than in getting the best data possible . Some background : At the center of the conspiracy theory are changes in the way the bureau asks people about their insurance coverage on the Current Population Survey , a monthly survey of some 50,000 people . The changes , in the works for more than a decade , are intended to elicit more accurate responses . The old questionnaire , for example , asked people if they had been insured in the prior year ; the new one is more specific .An unavoidable consequence of the change is a break in trend ,  which will make it impossible to compare the results from 2013 and 2014 with earlier years . To the conspiracy theorists , this break is evidence of a dastardly attempt to manipulate the insurance picture .What the senators want the bureau to do is keep asking the insurance coverage question the old , flawed way to preserve comparability , in addition to asking it the new way .That would be both undesirable and unnecessary .Undesirable , because asking basically the same question two different ways will yield conflicting data . Sure , one set of data would be intended only for purposes of comparison , while the newer set would reflect the best available tally of the number of uninsured . But conflicting numbers are bound to confuse the public .Unnecessary , because comparative data on insurance coverage is available without having to continue asking a flawed question .If the senators did their homework before reacting , they would know that for the past six years , the bureau has also asked about insurance coverage in the far larger American Community Survey . * The A.C.S . insurance-coverage question , which resembles the more accurate design of the new C.P.S . questionnaire , is currently used to get an annual fix on the number of uninsured people . Because the data goes back six years , it gives a consistent picture of the uninsured population before and after the enactment of the Affordable Care Act .Instead of messing with the C.P.S. , the senators should turn their attention to using the A.C.S . data more effectively . Because of its large sample size , the A.C.S . could be used to create an accurate monthly ( as opposed to annual ) tracking number of the uninsured , akin to what the bureau currently produces to help track unemployment and housing starts .The lack of a detailed monthly tally of the uninsured is a big hole in the nations statistics . Health care is one of the largest sectors of the economy and covering the uninsured is arguably the most important public policy related to it . Given that size and importance , it is not enough to broadly measure trends and progress , or lack thereof , once a year .To turn the A.C.S . data from an annual to a monthly figure would not cost much , because the data is already being collected . A one-time appropriation , surely a rounding error in the budget , would be needed to re-purpose the existing data and to create the reporting protocol . Small annual appropriations would keep the monthly reports on track after that .Working with the bureau to deliver monthly , comparable health coverage statistics would be a better use of lawmakers time than pandering , even inadvertently , to conspiracy theorists .*The percentage of the population without health insurance , according to the American Community Survey , 1-year estimates:2008 : 14.62009 : 15.12010 : 15.52011 : 15.12012 : 14.8"
-1	"If you spend enough time on the Internet youll eventually encounter a conspiracy theory . If you watch closely enough , sometimes you can actually see one being born .For years now some on the right have speculated that the Obama administration is trying to politicize the national census . Yesterday , Noah Rothman argued on Mediaite that the theory was proven correct by a New York Times article about changes in the way the Census Bureau plans to ask about health insurance coverage . The idea is that the new questions will show a reduction in the number of uninsured people starting in 2014 , which may make it seem as though the Affordable Care Act is working better than it really is . The change in questions will also produce a break in trend within the census surveys and thus make it impossible to statistically compare 2013 and 2014 with earlier years .Therefore , the White House must have ordered this sinister change to promote President Obamas signature domestic initiative .But the article that Mr. Rothman cites , by Robert Pear , doesnt support the theory . Mr. Pear reports that census statisticians had been trying to change the questions about health insurance for more than a decade ( in other words , before Mr. Obama was president ) because  wait for it  the old questions were not accurate:When asked about their insurance arrangements in the prior year , people tended to give answers about their coverage at the time of the interview  forgetting , for example , if they had Medicaid for a few months early in the prior year . People are continually moving on and off Medicaid rolls . The number of people who say in surveys that they have Medicaid coverage is almost always lower than the enrollment figures reported by federal and state agencies that administer the program.Mr. Pear also explained that the new questions were designed to produce more precise information on respondents coverage . The new survey asks people if they have coverage through an exchange , if it has premiums and if the premiums are subsidized because consumers often conflate Medicaid with subsidized private insurance .Heinous ! An outrage !"
-1	"It looks as though Republicans are no longer betting on the Affordable Care Act as a surefire political weapon . The Upshot reported on Wednesday that , in the summer of 2013 , lawmakers churned out 530 news releases using the term Obamacare. So far this summer , in advance of the mid-terms when one might expect that number to go up , its fallen dramatically , to 138 so far .In addition to this sign of waning interest , Bloomberg reported last Tuesday that Republicans in competitive Senate races are easing off their strategy of criticizing Democrats over the Affordable Care Act. Heres the situation in North Carolina , according to Bloomberg , where Democratic Senator Kay Hagan is in a statistical tie with her Republican challenger , Thom Tillis:In April , anti-Obamacare advertising dwarfed all other spots in North Carolina . It accounted for 3,061 , or 54 percent , of the 5,704 top five issue ads in North Carolina , according to Kantar Medias Campaign Media Analysis Group . By July , the numbers had reversed , with anti-Obamacare ads accounting for 971 , or 27 percent , of the top issue ads , and the budget , government spending , jobs and unemployment accounting for 2,608 , or 72 percent , of such ads , CMAG data show .Republicans of course havent embraced the Affordable Care Act . Now that its actually gone into effect , though , they seem to be slowly coming around the reality that its not at all the disaster they assumed it would be , and therefore may not draw voters to the polls ."
-1	"Back when rate shock , website problems and lagging enrollment were threatening to unravel the new health care law before it fully took effect , I concluded a column on Obamacares repeated near-death experiences with the following warning to conservatives:The welfare states ability to defend itself against reform , however , carries a cautionary message for Obamacares critics as well . What isnt killed outright grows stronger the longer its embedded in the federal apparatus , gaining constituents and interest-group support just by virtue of its existence even if it doesnt work out the way it was designed . And as disastrous as its launch has been , if the health care law can survive this crisis in the same limping , staggering way it survived Scott Brown and the Supremes , then it will be a big step closer to being part of the status quo , with all the privileges and political strength that entails .So yes  its possible that this brush with death will be fatal , possible that the law will fall with the lightest , most politically painless push . But its still likely that Obamacare will be undone only if its critics are willing to do something more painful , and take their own turn wrestling with a system that resists any kind of change .With the latest numbers showing exchange enrollment climbing toward 7 million , I think we can safely retire that possible ,  and change the likely to an all-but-definite. Not because rising enrollment proves that Obamacare is definitely working , in the sense that both its friends and critics would have originally understood the term . We dont know yet what the paid enrollment looks like or how successfully the program is actually enrolling the uninsured . ( After some grim estimates , this Rand study is making liberals feel a little more optimistic , but still suggests a below-expectations result . ) We dont know what the age-and-health-status composition of the enrollee pools looks like or what that means for premiums next year and beyond . We dont know if any of the suspended/postponed provisions of the law will actually take effect . And we certainly dont know what any of this means for social policy in the long run .But we do know that there wont be an immediate political unraveling , and that we arent headed for the kind of extremely-low-enrollment scenario that seemed conceivable just a few months ago , or the possible world where cancellations had ended up outstripping enrollment , creating a net decline in the number of insured . And knowing that much has significant implications for our politics . It means that the kind of welfare-state embedding described above is taking place on a significant scale , that a large constituency will be served by Obamacare ( through Medicaid as well as the exchanges ) in 2016 and beyond , and that any kind of conservative alternative will have to confront the reality that the kind of tinkering-around-the-edges alternatives to Obamacare that many Republicans have supported to date would end up stripping coverage from millions of newly-insured Americans . That newly-insured constituency may not be as large as the bills architects originally hoped , or be composed of the range of buyers that the program ultimately needs . But it will be a fact on the ground to an extent that was by no means certain last December . And that fact will shape , and constrain , the options of the laws opponents even in the event that Republicans manage to reclaim the White House two years hence .Such political and policy constraints , I should note , are potentially a good thing for would-be conservative reformers , since the serious right-of-center alternatives to Obamacare have always included policies to expand coverage , and with a coverage expansion accomplished , Republicans may find themselves effectively forced in a more serious direction . ( This is a drum that Avik Roy , among others , has been beating for some time . ) Or so I would hope ; of course , they might just end up drifting toward gimmicky micro-reforms instead , or find themselves embroiled a ruinous civil war over how hard to push toward some kind of full repeal .But wherever they go and whatever they do , they will have to deal with the reality that Obamacare , thrice-buried , looks very much alive ."
-1	"LAST spring , a 48-year-old mother of two young girls in Colorado discovered that she had colon cancer . Her surgeon and oncologist disagreed about whether she needed chemotherapy . So a friend recommended she go to MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston for a second opinion . Just before she booked her plane ticket , a representative from MD Anderson called , informing her that its oncologists were outside her insurance companys network and that she should bring $ 10,000 for the consultation .Many Americans can relate to this . Last year , a Kaiser survey reported that almost all individuals and families with employer-sponsored health insurance have policies that come with at least some network restrictions . These plans steer us toward certain providers and away from others .This saves a lot of money . Insurance companies can negotiate with in-network physicians and hospitals to accept lower payments in exchange for more patients . They can include in their networks only physicians who are more efficient  who order fewer unnecessary tests , use more generic drugs and tend to keep patients healthier and out of the hospital . As a result , they can ensure that they , and their customers , get more bang for the buck .Despite the fact that so many Americans are already in selective networks , they are nervous that the Affordable Care Act , which I helped design as an adviser to the Obama administration , will further restrict their choice of doctors or make them pay higher out-of-network charges . There was a similar backlash in the 1990s , when managed care was on the rise .But selective networks themselves are not a problem . The problem is that not all networks are of consistently high quality .Millions of people enroll in top-flight managed care plans like Kaiser Permanente , limiting themselves to the physicians employed by these companies . Rarely do you hear Kaiser beneficiaries complain about the tyranny of their restrictive network . Why should they , when they have first-rate providers ?As more people enter the A.C.A.s new insurance exchanges , they will get to choose between a bronze plan with a narrow network and lower premiums and a platinum plan with a broader network and higher premiums . Inevitably , some insurance plans will offer narrow networks with poor-quality providers .However , there are four ways that we could reassure Americans that they are getting high-quality care despite choosing a narrow network .First , the exchanges should require that networks meet a minimum level of adequacy  meaning there are sufficient numbers of each type of practitioner in every geographic area . The National Committee for Quality Assurance , a nonprofit group , has already created network adequacy standards that could be applied .Second , we need more transparency . Insurance companies should have to publish the measures they use to select their high performing or efficient networks . This will discourage them from looking at price alone . And consumers should be able to easily find which doctors and hospitals are included in a network . The size of a plans network should be as transparent as its premium .Third , we need more reliable ways of measuring the quality of networks and the doctors and hospitals within them . The N.C.Q.A . or Consumer Reports could develop a grading system , from A to F. When comparing different plans , no one should have to rely on U.S. News and World Reports flawed rankings or hearsay from acquaintances .Finally , insurance companies  which desperately want to avoid repeating the managed-care backlash  should incorporate a safety valve for patients like the mother with colon cancer in Colorado . They should allow any enrollee who develops a serious condition like cancer to obtain a second opinion at a recognized center of excellence ( like Memorial SloanKettering , for cancer , or the Cleveland Clinic , for heart disease ) for the price of an in-network deductible or co-payment . The companies could negotiate good prices with these centers in exchange for a large volume of referrals . Patients want to know , and ought to be assured , that they are getting the best treatment possible .In the end , the patient with colon cancer was able to get a second opinion at the University of Colorado Cancer Center , where the specialists were in her network . They reassured her that she didnt need chemotherapy after all . She paid nothing out of pocket . She was lucky , because she was able to see a high-quality specialist despite her plans restrictions . But this shouldnt come down to luck ; it should be the basic standard of care ."
-1	"HAVING spent the last year reporting for a series of articles on the high cost of American medicine , Ive heard it all . There was Fred Abrahams , 77 , a skier who had surgery on both ankles for arthritis  one in New York for more than $ 200,000 and one in New Hampshire for less than $ 40,000 . There was Matthew Landman , 41 , billed more than $ 100,000 for antivenin administered in an E.R . after a small rattlesnake bite . There was Robin Miller , a Florida businessman , who needed to buy an implantable defibrillator for his ill brother , who was uninsured ; the machine costs tens of thousands of dollars , but he couldnt get a price for a make or a model .Extreme anecdotes , perhaps . But the series has prompted more than 10,000 comments of outrage and frustration  from patients , doctors , politicians , even hospital and insurance executives .As of Jan. 1 , the Affordable Care Act promises for the first time to deliver the possibility of meaningful health insurance to every American . But where does that leave the United States in terms of affordable care ?Even supporters see Obamacare as a first step on a long quest to bring Americans affordable medicine , with further adjustments , interventions and expansions needed .There are plenty of interesting ideas being floated to help repair the system , many of which are being used in other countries , where health care spending is often about half of that in the United States . For example , we could strictly regulate prices or preset payment levels , as is currently done for hospital stays under Medicare , the national insurance program for people over 65 , or at least establish fair price corridors for procedures and drugs . We could require hospitals and doctors to provide price lists and upfront estimates to allow consumers to make better choices . We could stop paying doctors and hospitals for each service they performed and instead compensate them with a fixed monthly fee for taking care of each patient . We could even make medical school free or far cheaper and then require service afterward .But the nation is fundamentally handicapped in its quest for cheaper health care : All other developed countries rely on a large degree of direct government intervention , negotiation or rate-setting to achieve lower-priced medical treatment for all citizens . That is not politically acceptable here . A lot of the complexity of the Affordable Care Act arises from the political need in the U.S. to rely on the private market to provide health care access ,  said Dr. David Blumenthal , a former adviser to President Obama and president of the Commonwealth Fund , a New York-based foundation that focuses on health care .With that political backdrop , Obamacare deals only indirectly with high prices . By regulating and mandating insurance plans , it seeks to create a better , more competitive market that will make care from doctors and hospitals cheaper . But it primarily relies on a trickle-down theory of cost containment . The Princeton health economist Uwe E. Reinhardt has called it a somewhat ugly patch on a somewhat ugly system.With half a billion dollars spent by medical lobbyists each year , according to the Washington-based Center for Responsive Politics , our fragmented profit-driven system is effectively insulated from many of the forces that control spending elsewhere . Even Medicare is not allowed to negotiate drug prices for its tens of millions of beneficiaries , and Americans are forbidden by law to re-import medicines made domestically and sold more cheaply abroad .And so American patients are stuck with bills and treatment dilemmas that seem increasingly Kafkaesque . The hopeful news is that American health care spending has grown at a slower pace over the past four years . While that is partly because of the recession , economists say , many credit the cost-containing forces unleashed by Obamacare with a significant assist . Even at that rate , many models suggest that nearly 25 percent of gross domestic product will be eaten up by health care in 20 years . That is not sustainable .Its like a diet you cant just stop , because its starting to work ,  said Michael Chernew , an economist at Harvard Medical School . And remember , we havent even lost weight yet , were just gaining weight more slowly.Many health economists say we must move away from the so-called fee-for-service model , where doctors and hospitals bill every event , every pill , every procedure , even hourly rental of the operating room . Though insurers try to hold down costs by negotiating discounts or limiting reimbursement , this strategy has limited power because armies of consultants now advise hospitals on what is known as strategic billing : Losing money from trauma patients ? Hospitals can add on a $ 10,000-plus trauma activation fee. Medicare not paying enough for a broken wrist ? Add a separate casting fee to the bill ."

-1	"LOS ANGELES  THE Anthem Blue Cross representative who answered my call told me that there was a silver lining in the cancellation of my individual P.P.O . policy and the $ 5,400 annual increase that I would have to pay for the Affordable Care Act-compliant option : now if I have Stage 4 cancer or need a sex-change operation , Id be covered regardless of pre-existing conditions . Never mind that the new provider network would eliminate coverage for my and my sons long-term doctors and hospitals .The Anthem rep cheerily explained that despite the companys  I paraphrase  draconian rates and limited network , my benefits , which also include maternity coverage ( handy for a 46-year-old ) , would be actually much richer.I , of course , would be actually much poorer . And it was this aspect of the bum deal that , to my surprise , turned out to be a very unpopular thing to gripe about .Obamacare or Kafkacare ?  I posted on Facebook as soon as I hung up with Anthem . I vented about the call and wrote that the president should be protecting the middle class , not making our lives substantially harder . For extra sympathy , I may have thrown in the fact that Im a single mom . ( O.K. , I did . )Then I sat back and waited for the love to pour in . Or at least the like. Lots of likes . After all , I have 1,037 Facebook friends . Surely , theyd commiserate .Except that they didnt .Instead , aside from my friend David , who attempted to cheer me up with , My dad , who never turns down a bargain , would take the sex change just because its free ,  my respondents implied  in posts that , to my annoyance , kept getting more likes  that it was beyond uncool to be whining about myself when the less fortunate would finally have insurance .The nation has been better off ,  wrote one friend . Over 33 million people who did not have insurance are now going to get it. Thats all fine and good for the nation ,  but what about my $ 5,400 rate hike ( after-tax dollars , I wanted to add , but dared not in this group of previously closeted Mother Teresas ) ? Another friend wrote , Yes , Im paying an extra 200 a month , but Im okay with doing that so that others who need it can have health care.I was shocked . Who knew my friends were such humanitarians ? Has Obamacare made it un-P.C . to be concerned by a serious burden on my familys well-being ?The heated reactions even moved offline . Frustrated , I observed to one friend who was covered through her work that when an issue didnt affect people directly , they became theoretically generous. Ask them to donate several thousand dollars so that the less fortunate can have medical insurance  which is exactly what President Obama is asking me to do  and Ill bet theyd change their tune about ending inequality and creating fairness and doing whats good for the country.Refreshingly , the two people who showed real empathy were my insurance broker and my friend Nicole , who sent daily links to news stories about people who were also stripped of their coverage and mandated to buy expensive exchange or private policies without access to their current doctors , yet just missed the cutoff for subsidies .There was one story about people suing Anthem for not being grandfathered in after changing their policies post-2010 . In fact , it was in 2011 that I altered mine , dumping maternity benefits so that I didnt have to pay for everyone elses pregnancies . Little did I know Id end up losing my insurance and paying for everyone elses pregnancies .There was even an article about a cancer patient who had lost access to her doctors . To her credit , Nicole refrained from saying , But , Lori , this woman has cancer and you are so much more fortunate ! Like Bridget Joness smug marrieds ,  the smug insureds  friends who were covered through their own or spouses employers or who were grandfathered into their plans  asked why I didnt just switch all of our long-term doctors , suck it up and pay an extra $ 200 a month for a restrictive network on the exchange , or marry the guy Im dating . How romantic : I didnt marry you just to save money , honey . I married you for your provider network.Along with the smug insureds , President Obama doesnt care much about the relatively small percentage of us with canceled coverage and no viable replacement . He keeps apologizing while maintaining that its for the good of the country , a vast improvement over all.And the over all might agree . But the self-employed middle class is being sacrificed at the altar of politically correct rhetoric , with nobody helping to ensure our health , fiscal or otherwise , because its trendy to cheer for the underdog . Embracing the noble cause is all very well  as long as yours isnt the fortunate family that loses its access to comprehensive , affordable health care while the rest of the nation gets it .The truly noble act here is being performed by my friend Nicole , who keeps posting Obamacare fiasco stories on my Facebook page , despite being conspicuously ignored , except for my single like. Its the lone like that falls in the forest , the click nobody wants to hear ."
-1	"Although few Americans say the Affordable Care Act has helped them , the uninsured rate has declined significantly since the law took effect , and appears to be leveling off at around 13.4 percent .Via GallupThe uninsured rate so far in the second quarter of 2014 is 13.4 % , with the rate in April and May as individual months also averaging 13.4 % , respectively .The percentage of U.S. adults lacking insurance coverage in the first two months of the second quarter of 2014 is down from 17.1 % in the fourth quarter of 2013 and from the 15.6 % average in the first quarter of 2014 . The current 13.4 % average for the second quarter of 2014 is the lowest level recorded since Gallup began tracking this measure in 2008 ."
-1	"The Supreme Courts ruling last week in the Hobby Lobby case wasnt based on a fundamental right found in the First Amendment or anywhere else in the Constitution . When the justices said that closely held corporations have religious rights that let them refuse to pay for insurance plans that cover contraceptives , they based their decision on a 1993 law passed by Congress , the Religious Freedom Restoration Act .That means Congress has the ability to rewrite federal law to overrule the courts decision , and Senate Democrats have wasted little time coming up with a bill to do just that . The bill , sponsored by Patty Murray of Washington and Mark Udall of Colorado , was introduced today , co-sponsored by 38 other Democrats . It wouldnt rewrite the 1993 law , which was intended to protect the religious rights of individuals . But it would make it clear that the law doesnt permit employers to refuse to comply with the Affordable Care Act , which requires contraceptives to be covered by health insurance .It would be illegal for employers to cite a religious reason for disobeying the health law , as Hobby Lobby did . The only exception would be for houses of worship and religious non-profits , which have already been granted an accommodation by the Obama administration . ( The Supreme Court seemed willing to undermine that accommodation , too , in an order released last Thursday that said religious groups didnt have to abide by the administrations rules , but the proposed bill would put Congress on the record in support of it . )A memo issued by Ms. Murray noted that the 13,000 employees of Hobby Lobby took a job at an arts and crafts store , not a church or synagogue .The Supreme Courts decision allows for-profit business like Hobby Lobby to impose their religious beliefs on their employees ,  the memo says . The Court decision ignores the fact that the employees beliefs about religion are just as important and deserving of protection as the employers.It would be surprising if the bill picked up more than two or three Republican votes since it praises the Affordable Care Act , which is officially loathed by the Republican Party . Its a message bill , in the cynical parlance of Capitol Hill , which will die by filibuster in the Senate and has no chance of reaching the floor of the House . But at least that message is clear , and next week senators will have to reveal whether they think employers should have the right to intrude on their employees lives ."

-1	"HANOVER , N.H.  NOW that its clear that Obamacare is here to stay , its supporters should focus on making the program better . Fixes are not a sign of weakness . They are a sign of responsiveness and of good management . And the Affordable Care Act does have its flaws . Heres a big one : It favors screening over diagnosis .While the distinction may seem arcane , it has real-world implications . Screening is what we offer to the well ; its the effort to find abnormalities in those who do not have signs or symptoms of disease . Because screening is considered part of preventive care under the Affordable Care Act , it is provided at no charge .Diagnosis is what we offer to those who do have signs or symptoms of disease . Because diagnosis is not preventive care , it is subject to deductibles and co-payments .In other words : A woman over 40 can have a free screening mammogram . But if she notices a breast lump and goes to her doctor to have it evaluated , shell pay for a diagnostic mammogram . That could cost $ 300 . So the woman at lower risk for cancer  the one with no signs or symptoms of the disease  has an incentive to be tested , while the woman at higher risk  the one with the lump  faces a disincentive .Does that make any sense ? No . But it could encourage women with breast lumps not to report their symptoms .Just how crazy this is became apparent to me when a friend enrolled on the New Hampshire exchange . Melissa is a 50-something self-employed author . She chose to be screened for colon cancer using the test doctors are most certain lowers colon cancer mortality  annual fecal occult blood testing .Melissas screening test was free under the Affordable Care Act . It was also positive  she had blood in her stool , meaning she was at higher risk to actually have colon cancer . Everyone agreed about the next step : a diagnostic colonoscopy , to figure out where the blood was coming from . Thats not free ; its real money , thousands of dollars . But had she chosen the colonoscopy as her first screening test , it would have been free .Melissa contacted her insurer , and a representative suggested she ask her gastroenterologist to resubmit the colonoscopy claim as preventive . Pressure on doctors to recode diagnostic tests as screening tests is the inevitable result of this incentive mismatch between screening and diagnosis . But its also fraud , and Melissa knew it was wrong .The gastroenterologists already got one fix in the Affordable Care Act . At first , screening colonoscopy was free , but if the test found a polyp , it was correctly reclassified as a diagnostic procedure , and was subject to cost sharing . In February 2013 , regulators fixed the problem , saying insurance companies must also make polyp removal during screening free , noting , polyp removal is an integral part of a colonoscopy.Its true : Subsequent interventions are an integral part of all screening . Were I a mammographer , Id happily argue that additional mammographic views , ultrasounds , M.R.I.s and breast biopsies are all part of screening .But if you notice a new breast lump , you pay .I wish money wasnt such a powerful incentive in medical care . But the economists are right : Incentives matter . Right now they favor lower risk patients ( those being screened ) over higher risk ones ( those with signs and symptoms ) .They also encourage a feeding frenzy among providers to recategorize diagnostic testing as screening . Free screenings were seen as a way to get people through the door and ideally to find and address problems before they become more dangerous and expensive .But in practice , it may not work this way . Some hospitals offer free screening knowing full well that the costs will be more than made up for by all the subsequent services required . More testing , false alarms and overdiagnosis are all part of screening . And if you make it free , patients are less likely to give proper consideration to these potential harms  not to mention the potential for a lot of out-of-pocket costs down the line .Heres the fix : Eliminate the incentive mismatch between screening and diagnosis . Treat them equally . Melissa would share in the cost of her fecal occult blood test . ( But at around $ 10 to $ 20 , its still roughly one one-hundredth of the cost of a colonoscopy . )We need people to consider medical care carefully , and thats what cost sharing is all about . Patients already share costs on what is arguably the most important preventive service , treatment for really high blood pressure , and for procedures as necessary as setting a broken leg . Why would we treat a much closer call  screening  any different ?But if you think the need for this fix is evidence that the Affordable Care Act should be repealed , think again . Melissa had a mammogram at age 29 because her doctor thought she felt a lump . It was just fibrous tissue , but as a result , insurance companies put a rider on her policy disqualifying her from coverage for breast cancer . Thats right : Before the Affordable Care Act , if she developed the cancer that leads to the most deaths among nonsmoking women , she would not have been covered . No one wants to go back there ."
-1	"Cambridge , Mass .ON the second day of oral arguments over the Affordable Care Act , Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. , trying to explain what sets health care apart , told the Supreme Court , This is a market in which you may be healthy one day and you may be a very unhealthy participant in that market the next day. Justice Antonin Scalia subsequently expressed skepticism about forcing the young to buy insurance : When they think they have a substantial risk of incurring high medical bills , theyll buy insurance , like the rest of us.May the justices please meet my sister-in-law . On Feb. 8 , she was a healthy 32-year-old , who was seven and a half months pregnant with her first baby . On Feb. 9 , she was a quadriplegic , paralyzed from the chest down by a car accident that damaged her spine . Miraculously , the baby , born by emergency C-section , is healthy .Were the Obama health care reforms already in place , my brother and sister-in-laws situation  insurance-wise and financially  would be far less dire . My brothers small employer  he is the manager of a metal-fabrication shop  does not offer health insurance , which was too expensive for them to buy on their own . Fortunately , my sister-in-law had enrolled in the Access for Infants and Mothers program , Californias insurance plan for middle-income pregnant women . AIM coverage extends 60 days postpartum and paid for her stay in intensive care and early rehabilitation .But when the 60 days is up next week , the family will fall through the welfare medicine rabbit hole . As a scholar of social policy at M.I.T. , I teach students how the system works . Now I am learning , in real time .For health coverage , the baby fares best . He is insured through Healthy Families , Californias version of the Childrens Health Insurance Program , the federal-state plan for lower-income children ineligible for Medicaid whose families can not afford private insurance . California is relatively generous , with eligibility extending up to 250 percent of the federal poverty level of $ 19,090 for a family of three ; 27 states have lower limits .When the AIM coverage expires , my sister-in-law will be covered by Medi-Cal , Californias version of Medicaid , because she is disabled and has limited income . But because my brother works , they are subject to cost-sharing : they pay the first $ 1,100 of her health costs each month . Paying $ 1,100 leaves them with a monthly income of just 133 percent of the federal poverty level . If my brother makes more money , their share of the cost increases .They must also meet the Medi-Cal asset test : beyond their house and one vehicle , they can hold $ 3,150 in total assets , a limit last adjusted in 1989 . They can not save for retirement ( retirement plans are not exempt from the asset test in California , as they are in some states ) . They can not save for college ( California is not among the states that have exempted 529 college savings plans from their asset tests ) . They can not establish an emergency fund . Family members like me can not give them financial help , at least not officially . If either of them receives an inheritance , it will go to Medi-Cal . Medi-Cal services that my sister-in-law uses after age 55 will be added to a tab that she will rack up over the rest of her life . When she and my brother die , the state will put a lien on their estate ; their child may inherit nothing . Even my brothers hobby runs afoul of the asset test : he enjoys working on old cars , which he can no longer keep .These are the limitations under which 7.5 million Medi-Cal recipients live . Nationwide , more than 50 million people are covered by their states version of Medicaid . Some states are more lenient in their income and asset tests , others less so . Nowhere is life in these programs a picnic .That said , Medicaid is an important safety net for the poor , and the Obama reform would expand the program to cover all Americans under 133 percent of the poverty level ( currently one has to be both poor and categorically eligible  a child or a pregnant woman , for example ) . But for the middle class who are thrust into Medicaid by circumstance , the programs strictures are truly life-altering . My brother and sister-in-law desperately wanted to buy insurance and now wonder how to escape Medi-Cals forced penury . My sister-in-law will qualify for Medicare after the mandatory 24-month waiting period for disabled people , but Medi-Cal will be the secondary payer .Their best hope is the survival of the Obama reform . Perhaps my brother can get a job that offers health insurance for the family , but without the reforms protections , like the prohibition on denying coverage for pre-existing conditions , removal of annual and lifetime insurance caps , and reinsurance for large claims , there is no guarantee that they could obtain insurance . More likely , they would buy insurance on a health exchange . Here in Massachusetts , where such an exchange is in place , they could have purchased a plan with an affordable premium ( at their income level , the monthly premiums range from $ 39 to $ 91 per adult ) . And these money and insurance issues would not have added to the other stresses in their profoundly changed lives .Instead , their financial future is shattered . Family and friends are raising money to buy a wheelchair van and to renovate their home for accessibility . The generosity of the local community is stunning . One incident in particular struck me to the core . A woman from a small community nearby had something for us . A cancer survivor , she had decided to give back by placing donation cans in stores around town . She had finished her drive and consolidated the money . The small coffee can she handed over to me and my sister-in-law had a slit in the lid and was decorated with pink felt and ribbons , now a little smudged from handling . Inside were several hundred dollars in small bills . We burst into tears . This is social policy in the richest nation in the history of the world ."
-1	"IN just over a decade the United States will need 130,000 more doctors than medical schools are producing . So says the Association of American Medical Colleges , which warns of a doctor shortage that will drive up wait times , shorten office visits and make it harder for Americans to access the care they need .The road to Obamacare has seen its share of speed bumps , as well as big potholes . But a physician shortage is unlikely to be one of its roadblocks .Shortage forecasters point to two major factors . One is an aging population . The proportion of Americans who are 65 and older will increase to 19 percent in 2030 from 12.9 percent today , according to federal projections . Second , Obamacare will insure 30 million more Americans by the end of the decade , dramatically increasing demand for physicians . Extrapolating forward from todays 2.4 physicians per 1,000 Americans would mean we will need at least 90,000 more physicians by 2020 , or so the reasoning goes .Regardless of your political views , there are good reasons to be skeptical of these predictions . Take Massachusetts , where Obamacare-style reforms were implemented beginning in 2006 , adding nearly 400,000 people to the insurance rolls . Appointment wait times for family physicians , internists , pediatricians , obstetricians and gynecologists , and even specialists like cardiologists , have bounced around since but have not appreciably increased overall , according to a Massachusetts Medical Society survey . Massachusettss experience may differ from other areas , particularly rural regions , but the results of reform there suggest shortage fears are exaggerated .The population is indeed aging fast , but the methods of treating illness in old age are also changing quickly . Today , more patients can be cared for in subacute settings rather than in hospitals . And new technologies are turning the treatment of many medical conditions into less resource-intensive endeavors , requiring fewer doctors to manage each episode of illness .Innovations , such as sensors that enable remote monitoring of disease and more timely interventions , can help pre-empt the need for inpatient treatment . Drugs and devices can also obviate the need for more costly treatments . Minimally invasive procedures , like laparoscopic surgeries , can be done more quickly with faster recovery times and fewer physicians . An average patient stay in the hospital is about two days or less following a stent but about seven days following a coronary bypass operation . Research on radiation treatments for breast cancer suggests that 15 treatments can be just as effective as the traditional 30 treatments . Likewise , one larger dose of radiation can be as good at relieving pain from bone metastases as five to 10 separate , smaller treatments . Theres every reason to expect the pace of these timesaving medical innovations to continue .Other medical personnel can also expand the reach of physicians to care for a larger population . Nurse practitioners , health aides , pharmacists , dietitians , psychologists and others already care for patients in numerous ways , and their roles should expand in the future . The rise of nonphysician providers will enable more team care . Skilled health aides will monitor patients at home and alert a doctor if certain medical parameters decline . Nurses will provide wound care to diabetic patients , adjust medications like blood thinners and provide the initial management of chemotherapy side effects for cancer patients . Pharmacists will provide more counseling and urgent care . Physicians will remain essential to the proper diagnosis and treatment of disease , but will be backed up by teams who will help manage the more routine features of chronic illness .The opportunity exists to deliver more services and care with fewer physicians , but its not a foregone conclusion . Policy changes will be necessary to reach the full potential of team care .That means expanding the scope of practice laws for nurse practitioners and pharmacists to allow them to provide comprehensive primary care ; changing laws inhibiting telemedicine across state lines ; and reforming medical malpractice laws that force providers to stick with inefficient practices simply to reduce liability risk . New payment models must reward investments in technologies that can save money in the long run . Most important , we need to change medical school curriculum to provide training in team care to take full advantage of the capabilities of nonphysicians in caring for patients .Instead of building more medical schools and expanding our doctor pool , we should focus on increasing the productivity of existing physicians and other health care workers while incorporating new technologies and practices that make care more efficient . With doctors , as with drugs or surgery , more is not always better ."
-1	"THIS month , a dysfunctional website stymied hundreds of thousands of Americans trying to check out new health insurance options under the Affordable Care Act . But that embarrassing technical glitch may have masked a more fundamental question : Can Americans shop effectively for health care ?Most developed countries do not even ask their citizens to be smart health care consumers ; in one way or another , they control prices and offer a more constrained array of options . But Americans are fans of freedom and choice  or at least the illusion of it . And they have cast their lot with so-called consumer driven health care .In the past five years there has been a proliferation of services to help consumers with their deliberations . The American Board of Internal Medicine began the Choosing Wisely campaign to steer patients away from tests that may be unnecessary . Websites like Health Care Bluebook , Fair Health and Clear Health Costs use insurance databases and patient crowdsourcing to find the going rates in local areas . The Affordable Care Act provides $ 70 million for patient navigators to find the best deals for particular health needs .Useful tools to be sure . But many economists say that placing the onus on buyers is unrealistic and unfair , especially given the way a vast majority of Americans get their health care . You cant really be a well-informed consumer right now because our current system is not set up to give the consumer relevant information on price , quality , services and access ,  said Glenn Melnick , professor of health care finance at the University of Southern California .Try to be a smart shopper for something basic : a medicine you take every day for a chronic condition like high blood pressure . That should be simple , right ? Hardly .There are some great new technologies to offer guidance for pill purchases , such as GoodRx.com , a company founded by veterans of Facebook and Yahoo ( the type of A team experts that Kathleen Sebelius , the secretary of health and human services , only belatedly drafted to troubleshoot healthcare.gov ) . The site and its app provide granular information on prescription prices in your area and coupons for deep discounts .Our mission is to bring transparency to this space ,  said Doug Hirsch , one of the companys co-founders . We have billions of scrips in our database , so you can see what it is at your local pharmacy and can look at the gazillions of discounts involved. Just over a year old , the site use is growing 20 to 30 percent a month .A few minutes on the site shows what Mr. Hirsch calls extraordinary price variations : drugs that sell for $ 150 a month at one pharmacy are given away to members of a loyalty program at another . I discovered that a generic prescription anti-inflammatory medicine for which I now pay a $ 20 monthly co-pay through my insurer is on Targets limited list of $ 4 prescriptions , although other drugs are far more expensive there .Unfortunately , GoodRx brings transparency to just one aspect of a system that remains an impenetrable black box in other respects . To know if the deals are beneficial , for example , you need to know what your insurance would otherwise require you to pay . Will it be a set co-pay , a percentage of the full price  whatever that is  or no coverage at all ? And that is determined by back-room negotiations between insurers and drug makers , pharmacies and middlemen , producing pricing that shifts from month to month and year to year .On Jan. 1 , tens of thousands of Americans will be shocked to discover that longstanding prescriptions for Advair , the most popular daily inhaler for adults with asthma , is no longer covered by Medco/Express Scripts , the largest private pharmacy benefit manager in the country . Patients will have to pay the retail price of $ 300 themselves .The logic for exclusion is that there are other branded inhalers containing similar types of medicines that will be eligible ( specifically Symbicort and Dulera ) , ones that are somewhat cheaper and should work as well . There is no generic for Advair .Rhinocort AQ , a popular nasal spray that retails for more than $ 150 , will be excluded by both Express Scripts and Caremark , the other large pharmacy manager .SUCH sudden shifts mean that shoppers need to be ever vigilant to get a good deal on their medicines : Your pharmacys current discount program may cover the 20 milligram dose , when you normally take 10 . The lowest price on your migraine medicine may be at a different chain than where you get your high blood pressure pill . The best offer of all may come from the drug maker in the form of a coupon to cover your co-pay , a controversial but widespread practice .And then theres the issue of access : Target sells my medicine for $ 4 , for example , but theres no Target near where I live , and its a bit of a pain to move my prescription .Now imagine scaling up this byzantine process to shop for a truly complicated purchase , like bypass surgery or cancer treatment . Some online services are using billing databases and crowdsourcing to give you a sense of what different doctors and hospitals are charging . But what about quality ?At the extreme end of the marketplace model is MediBid , an online service through which patients can solicit bids from physicians for needed procedures . It was founded by Ralph Weber , a financial consultant , and insurance can not be used . But the savings can be substantial for those without insurance or with a high-deductible policy .After Mr. Webers wife recently got an estimate of more than $ 14,000 for arthroscopic knee surgery near the couples Tennessee home ( not including the doctors fee ) , he put the procedure out to bid . He ended up driving his wife to Charlottesville , Va. , to take advantage of a $ 3,700 offer . This year , his service has sent patients for total hip replacements to Glendale , Calif. ( $ 14,450 all inclusive ) , San Antonio ( $ 19,000 ) and Oklahoma ( $ 12,500 ) . The usual cost runs more than $ 40,000 and , in some cities , far more .Many new health insurance policies  including those under the Affordable Care Act  are trying to prod us to become better consumers of health care by forcing us to pay a percentage of our bills . If you currently pay a fixed $ 20 co-pay you wont care much about the price , but if you pay 20 percent it will matter a lot if your scan costs $ 200 or $ 2,000 . Is that fair ?Until there is as much price transparency as there is for laundry soap , as much local competition is there is for gas , and as much freedom to choose between brands as there is for cars , even the smartest consumer may not get a good deal ."
-1	"GAINESVILLE , Fla .LAST Fourth of July , during a day at the beach , I experienced a sudden pain in my left calf . Two months later , I required an above-the-knee amputation . Compounding my distress was the fact that my doctors had no explanation for why the blood flow to that leg had been cut off . I had none of the usual risk factors for atherosclerosis , the hardening of the arteries . I had low cholesterol and no evidence of diabetes , and I had never smoked . No blood vessels were blocked elsewhere in my body .It took some further detective work to reveal what must have been the cause . Seventeen years earlier , in 1995 , I had surgery on my left Achilles tendon . To prevent bleeding during the procedure , a pressurized cuff was placed above my left knee to block the blood flow . Apparently , the cuff was left on too long , injuring the arteries . In the years since , the vessels progressively scarred and calcified , which eventually blocked all blood flow to my lower leg .I lost my leg because of a preventable error . The loss of a limb is traumatic , and I experience waves of sorrow and regret . I struggle with continual pain in my residual limb , and am trying to learn how to walk with my prosthesis . My work as a physician has been put on hold .For the past two decades I have been studying how to prevent errors in health care , and the irony of my present predicament strengthens my motivation to continue the quest . No one should ever have to experience such preventable harm .And yet many people do . Exactly how many , we cant say , because there is no national registry for injuries or deaths caused by medical errors . Over a decade ago , in the best study of its kind , the Institute of Medicine estimated that there were 44,000 to 98,000 deaths per year because of preventable errors in the American health system . For every death there are likely to be at least 10 serious injuries , so we can assume that roughly a million patients are seriously injured each year .Despite calls to action by patient advocates and the adoption of safety programs , there is no sign that the numbers of errors , injuries and deaths have improved . Why ? Because those responsible for the delivery of health care have been unable to change how they do things .They could help themselves by embracing the lessons of great manufacturing companies to improve quality and efficiency . Automatic alarm systems and shut-off switches can be designed to make it nearly impossible for caregivers to do the wrong thing . Checklists and specific protocols based on best practices for each procedure can also help .In my case , if an alarm had alerted the doctor to how long the cuff had been in place , if the cuff had automatically deflated after a period of time , or if a checklist had reminded the doctor to remove it , my leg might never have been injured . Better yet , if the doctors had not used the cuff , which evidence has shown can be dangerous to patients , I would still be walking on that leg today .Most of all , perhaps , we need better coordination and communication among caregivers . Consider what happened to Mary , my former wife and the mother of our two children . In 1988 , she was lying in an intensive care unit with less than a 10 percent chance of survival . Her first symptom , a pain in the sole of her right foot , had seemed so innocent . A neurologist said she had most likely injured a nerve during aerobic dance and the doctor ignored our requests for further tests . But when Marys leg began to swell , we sought the help of an internist . She diagnosed thrombophlebitis , inflammation from blood clots . Mary was then admitted to the hospital for a blood thinner , but the medical team gave her too small a dosage . Her clots extended into her lungs . Next she suffered a heart attack , respiratory failure , renal failure and shock .In desperation we transferred her care to another physician , who finally began treating her with corticosteroids for inflammation of the blood vessels . Over the next 24 hours , Marys symptoms reversed and she fully recovered . But we nearly lost her as a consequence of delayed decision-making , poorly coordinated care and a medication error .Eliminating errors has the added dividend of reducing costs . The cost for treating Marys thrombophlebitis should have been $ 16,000 ; the complications pushed the cost nearly six times higher . The hospital bill for my leg amputation was approximately $ 150,000 , my prosthesis cost more than $ 50,000 , and I have lost months of work .The Affordable Care Act has recognized this reality and is creating new reimbursement systems that reward the quality rather than the quantity of care . The act has also empowered an expert panel to create evidence-based treatment recommendations .I wish I could go back in time and implement these changes before my surgery . But there is no way to turn back the clock . My life will never be the same , nor will the lives of roughly a million other patients who suffer similar preventable injuries each year . But we can make sure that future patients dont suffer the same life-changing harm ."
-1	"ONE small consolation of our high-priced health care system  our $ 2.7 trillion collective medical bill  has been the notion that at least we get medical attention quickly .Americans look down on national health systems like Canadas and Britains because of their notorious waiting lists . In recent weeks , the Veterans Affairs hospitals have been pilloried for long patient wait times , with top officials losing their jobs .Yet there is emerging evidence that lengthy waits to get a doctors appointment have become the norm in many parts of American medicine , particularly for general doctors but also for specialists . And that includes patients with private insurance as well as those with Medicaid or Medicare .Merritt Hawkins , a physician staffing firm , found long waits last year when it polled five types of doctors offices about several types of nonemergency appointments including heart checkups , visits for knee pain and routine gynecologic exams . The waits varied greatly by market and specialty . For example , patients waited an average of 29 days nationally to see a dermatologist for a skin exam , 66 days to have a physical in Boston and 32 days for a heart evaluation by a cardiologist in Washington .The Commonwealth Fund , a New York-based foundation that focuses on health care , compared wait times in the United States to those in 10 other countries last year . We were smug and we had the impression that the United States had no wait times  but it turns out thats not true ,  said Robin Osborn , a researcher for the foundation . Its the primary care where were really behind , with many people waiting six days or more to get an appointment when they were sick or needed care.The study found that 26 percent of 2,002 American adults surveyed said they waited six days or more for appointments , better only than Canada ( 33 percent ) and Norway ( 28 percent ) , and much worse than in other countries with national health systems like the Netherlands ( 14 percent ) or Britain ( 16 percent ) . When it came to appointments with specialists , patients in Britain and Switzerland reported shorter waits than those in the United States , but the United States did rank better than the other eight countries .So it turns out that America has its own waiting problem . But we tend to wait for different types of medical interventions . And that is mainly a result of payment incentives , experts say .Americans are more likely to wait for office-based medical appointments that are not good sources of revenue for hospitals and doctors . In other countries , people tend to wait longest for expensive elective care  four to six months for a knee replacement and over a month for follow-up radiation therapy after cancer surgery in Canada , for example .In our market-based system , patients can get lucrative procedures rapidly , even when there is no urgent medical need : Need a new knee , or an M.R.I. , or a Botox injection ? Youll probably be on the schedule within days . But what if youre an asthmatic whose breathing is deteriorating , or a diabetic whose medicines need adjustment , or an elderly patient who has unusual chest pain and needs a cardiology consultation ? In much of the country , you can wait a week or weeks for such office appointments  or longer if you need to find a doctor who accepts your insurance plan or Medicare .And those waits are likely to get longer as the Affordable Care Act brings tens of millions of newly insured patients into a system that is often already poorly equipped to provide basic care . I fully expect wait times to be going up this year for Medicaid and Medicare and private insurance because we are expanding access to care , but were not really expanding the system of providers ,  said Steven D. Pizer , a health care economist at Northeastern University in Boston .The Department of Veterans Affairs , which is reeling from revelations of long patient wait times at its hospitals , is actually one of the only health care systems in the nation that openly tracks waiting times and has standards for what they should be . The V.A . does have some deficiencies which are being exposed right now , but compared to what ?  said Dave A. Chokshi , a former White House Fellow with the Veterans Affairs Department and a professor at NYU Langone Medical Center . There arent really accepted benchmarks for whats reasonable in the private sector.Like the V.A . system , many national health programs abroad are required to keep track of wait times because they are spending government money . But such systems also have medical and financial incentives to curb wait times and dispense preventive care in a timely manner : If people with relatively routine problems cant see a doctor or a specialist for an office visit , their problems often fester and require more expensive hospital treatment .For that reason , Britains National Health Service stipulates a standard that patients should wait in an emergency room no more than four hours if they are to be admitted to a hospital . The organization also tracks how many patients wait more than six weeks for needed diagnostic tests ( 1 percent recently ) . Canada , for its part , tracks wait times province by province and procedure by procedure .And as the Department of Veterans Affairs discovered , when wait times are public , there is often heavy pressure for improvement . The U.K. puts a lot of effort into reducing wait times because its a huge political issue  it wins or loses elections ,  Dr. Osborn of the Commonwealth Fund said . In the U.S. , compared to other countries , wait times have been less of a national conversation.To reduce waits , countries have tried various interventions , such as assigning more medical staff members to trouble spots , redesigning scheduling algorithms to prioritize certain appointments and requiring at least one medical office in a given region to be open nights and weekends so patients dont have to visit emergency rooms . In the Commonwealth Fund report , 39 percent of insured Americans and 48 percent of the uninsured had visited an emergency room in the past two years , compared with less than 25 percent of Germans and Dutch .In the United States , Dr. Pizer said , shorter waits could be achieved by allowing nurses and physician assistants more leeway to open their own practices and perform simple diagnoses and procedures . Medical schools could be better motivated to turn out doctors in needed fields like primary care . The Merritt Hawkins survey found that Boston , the city with the most doctors per capita , had some of the longest wait times , because the city is flush with specialists .Finally , its worth remembering that waiting for medical care can be either harmful or beneficial , depending on circumstances , doctors say .Wait times for office visits are certainly bad for the old and frail who have conditions that require frequent monitoring like heart problems and diabetes , Dr. Chokshi said . And they can be deadly if a depressed person waits months for a first therapists appointment .But patience can pay off for many other conditions , like joint pain and viral infections , where  given a little time  the body often heals on its own .There is widespread agreement that Americans receive unnecessary treatment when it is profitable to do so . For example , they are far more likely to get steroid injections or surgery for back pain than people in other countries , even though medical guidelines suggest six weeks of conservative treatment before other interventions are tried ; backs often heal on their own , and there are risks to the procedures .Sometimes , it would seem , a little more waiting would do us some good ."
-1	"WE need death panels .Well , maybe not death panels , exactly , but unless we start allocating health care resources more prudently  rationing , by its proper name  the exploding cost of Medicare will swamp the federal budget .But in the pantheon of toxic issues  the famous third rails of American politics  none stands taller than overtly acknowledging that elderly Americans are not entitled to every conceivable medical procedure or pharmaceutical .Most notably , President Obamas estimable Affordable Care Act regrettably includes severe restrictions on any reduction in Medicare services or increase in fees to beneficiaries . In 2009 , Sarah Palins rant about death panels even forced elimination from the bill of a provision to offer end-of-life consultations .Now , three years on , the Republican vice-presidential nominee , Paul D. Ryan , has offered his latest ambitious plan for addressing the Medicare problem . But like Mr. Obamas , it holds limited promise for containing the programs escalating costs within sensible boundaries .The Obama and Ryan plans are not without common ground ; both propose an identical formula for capping the growth in Medicare spending per beneficiary . And both dip into the same toolbox ( particularly lower payments to providers ) to achieve a reduction of nearly $ 1 trillion in Medicare expenditures over the next decade from projected levels .Thats where the agreement ends . Mr. Ryan believes that meeting the goal over the long term requires introducing more competition into Medicare through vouchers to purchase private insurance .But Ryans approach was rendered toothless when the issues brutal politics forced him to retreat from his initial tough plan to simply cap the growth in government spending on Medicare and stick the inevitable overage onto beneficiaries . Under his revised plan , private insurers would be required to offer the same level of benefits as traditional Medicare , meaning that any savings would have to come from unidentified efficiencies ( the ever-popular waste , fraud and abuse ) .If the cap was breached  as it almost certainly would eventually be  Mr. Ryan blithely says , Congress would be required to intervene. Fat chance ; Congress regularly does the opposite when it rolls back caps on payments to doctors and hospitals .Meanwhile , Mr. Obamas hopes for sustained cost containment are pinned on a to-be-determined mix of squeezing reimbursements , embracing a selection of the creative ideas that have spewed forth from health care policy wonks and scouring the globe for innovations .To Mr. Obamas credit , his plan has more teeth than Mr. Ryans ; if his Independent Payment Advisory Board comes up with savings , Congress must accept either them or vote for an equivalent package . The problem is , the advisory board cant propose reducing benefits ( a k a rationing ) or raising fees ( another form of rationing ) , without which the spending target looms impossibly large .Thats the view of the bipartisan Medicare trustees , whose 2012 report stated : Actual future Medicare expenditures are likely to exceed the intermediate projections shown in this report , possibly by quite large amounts.To be sure , health care cost increases have moderated , in part because of the recession and in part because Medicare has been tightening its reimbursements . But those thumbscrews cant be tightened forever ; Medicare reimbursement rates are already well below those of private providers .Lets not forget that with the elderly population growing rapidly , even if cost increases for each beneficiary can be contained , Medicare would still claim a rising share of the American economy .Medicare needs to take a cue from Willie Sutton , who reportedly said he robbed banks because thats where the money was . The big money in Medicare is not to be found in Mr. Ryans competition or Mr. Obamas innovation , but in reducing the cost of treating people in the last year of life , which consumes more than a quarter of the programs budget .No one wants to lose an aging parent . And with price out of the equation , its natural for patients and their families to try every treatment , regardless of expense or efficacy . But that imposes an enormous societal cost that few other nations have been willing to bear . Many countries whose health care systems are regularly extolled  including Canada , Australia and New Zealand  have systems for rationing care .Take Britain , which provides universal coverage with spending at proportionately almost half of American levels . Its National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence uses a complex quality-adjusted life year system to put an explicit value ( up to about $ 48,000 per year ) on a treatments ability to extend life .At the least , the Independent Payment Advisory Board should be allowed to offer changes in services and costs . We may shrink from such stomach-wrenching choices , but they are inescapable ."

-1	"WASHINGTON  LOST in all the debate last week about whether or not the Affordable Care Act will hurt the economy is the fact that health care is already imposing a drag on growth .The health care sector has repeatedly helped to pull the economy from recession in recent decades , but this time around it is lagging behind the recovery .Health care spending grew more slowly than the economy in 2011 and 2012 and will probably be found to have done so again in 2013 . Meanwhile , health care employment also expanded more slowly than overall employment last year  and the government estimates that in January employment actually shrank for only the second time since 1990 .The reasons for this slowdown are not well understood . The Great Recession is clearly part of the story . Experts also point to changes in technology and in the way care is delivered and paid for . It seems likely that the landmark 2010 legislation is playing at least a small part , but the magnitude of its impact is hotly disputed .The consequences are easier to see , though : Lower health care spending isnt helping the economy to heal .Spending less on health care is a longstanding goal of pretty much everyone who doesnt work in the health care industry . The United States spends much more on health care than do other countries , and it seems likely that some of the money could be put to better use elsewhere . Also , making the health care sector more efficient not only frees up people , money and office space in places like Bostons hospital district , but it also cuts labor costs in other industries by cutting insurance premiums .But in the nations current economic malaise , idled resources are not being put to better use . Workers , companies and the federal government are all paying down debt rather than spending and investing . Fewer homes are being bought ; companies are building few factories . The government has been cutting back at a pace exceeded in modern times only during the military demobilizations after the Vietnam War and the Cold War .In the past , the health care industry leaned against the wind during downturns . The industry added jobs in every month from January 1990 through December 2013 , save for a month in the summer of 2003 . In 2001 , a recession year that saw total employment shrink 1.3 percent , health care jobs rose 3.5 percent .But the expansion of health care employment has slowed sharply over the past five years . Last year industry payrolls grew just 1.4 percent  almost a percentage point below the average annual increase in the decade before the 2007-9 recession .Health care prices are also rising more slowly . The 1.4 percent increase in 2013 was the slowest pace of health care inflation in at least half a century , and it was a key contributor to the sluggish 1.1 percent annual pace of overall inflation .This seems good . Inflation is widely reviled . But there is evidence that moderate inflation can help to stimulate economic activity . Rising prices spur people to borrow and spend more quickly . Rising prices also tend to raise nominal wages , making it easier for borrowers to pay fixed debts like mortgage loans .And sluggish inflation can be self-perpetuating . Inflation is rising slowly because the economy is weak , and slow inflation is restraining faster growth .Some economists see the slowdown in health care spending as a straightforward consequence of our broader economic problems : Were spending less on health care because were spending less on everything . The implication is that the trend is temporary .But that does not explain why health care spending has been recovering more slowly than spending on everything else . The most recent data , for 2012 , show that health care spending grew 3.7 percent while the economy grew 4.6 percent .An analysis last year by David Cutler , a Harvard economist who was President Obamas chief health care adviser during the 2008 presidential campaign , attributed 37 percent of the decline in health care spending from 2003 to 2012 to the recession and another 8 percent to specific changes in federal health care spending .The rest , he said , is harder to explain  but also more likely to endure . Expensive innovations like new drugs are arriving at a slower pace . A new focus on efficiency appears to be reducing costs . And changes that require patients to pay for a larger share of the care they receive may be inducing more second thoughts .The White House argued in a November analysis that the Affordable Care Act is contributing to the recent slow growth in health care prices and spending. And last week , the Congressional Budget Office agreed that specific cuts in spending on Medicare have contributed to the overall slow rate of cost growth in health care since the laws enactment. Since that time , the budget office has reduced its estimate of Medicare spending in 2020 by 12 percent , or $ 109 billion .The impact of these changes might have been less painful in good times . But Professor Cutler said it would have been ridiculous to argue for the preservation of the existing system , even temporarily , as a kind of economic stimulus program .If you take an industry thats countercyclical and you make it grow slower , then thats going to hurt you in a recession ,  he said . Thats absolutely true . But Im not sure the right answer is to say , Lets take one sector thats clearly bloated and imposing a horrible tax on the economy and make that sector stay bloated. Katherine Baicker , a professor of health economics at the Harvard School of Public Health , said it was a mistake to focus on the pain caused to workers in the health care industry rather than the benefits to everyone else .The cost of health care , she noted , is broadly distributed . Everyone pays for the industrys prosperity , either directly or in the form of insurance premiums .Do you really want to pay for surgeons salaries by having low-income people not be able to afford health insurance ?  she said . Its like the worlds least efficient jobs program . No one is suggesting that spending money on health care is bad . Its just that for a given outcome , if you could get it with fewer resources , that would be better for everyone . You could get more health . You could get more other stuff."
-1	"Three blog posts and a column should probably suffice to cover the debate over Obamacare and work incentives , but I dont want to let the topic drop without first stepping back and talking about the actual health policy disagreement here . My column and posts last week criticized what struck me as a kind of insouciance from liberals about this issue , shading into a post-work utopianism that doesnt wrestle with what , in practice , the decline of work is actually likely to mean for issues of class , mobility , and social equality . But its also important to recognize that for many liberal writers , the controlling assumption here is not anti-work or pro-work . Its just pro-universal health care as a basic standard for a decent society , with the consequences taken as they come .I would prefer that this perspective was accompanied by less chatter about how the only people working less because of Obamacare will be The Most Hardworking Amazing Moms in America , and fewer suggestions that its indecent and unpatriotic to worry about how welfare policy influences economic decision-making . But stripped of the Panglossian window dressing , its entirely reasonable to believe that some public goods are too important to be withheld just because they might have a few perverse consequences . ( I can certainly think of a few policies I would support even if they took a bite out workforce participation . )At least where the center-left is concerned , then , if you dig deep enough into the work-incentives debate youll hit the same old argument about the importance of universal comprehensive insurance . Thats why you keep seeing Obamacares defenders argue that the laws income effect  where people work less because theyre getting insurance benefits at a much-reduced cost  is mostly fine , because we dont want people having to work to afford a basic good like health insurance . And its why , when they talk about the substitution effect  the way the the subsidy phase-out creates an effective marginal tax that discourages working longer hours or taking a higher-paying job  they usually concede the existence of a problem , but then argue that the best way to solve it would be to extend Obamacares existing benefit further up the income ladder , or make it universal  in each case , at an expense that conservatives would inevitably oppose .Whats being implicitly ruled out , in both cases , is the possibility that government should be subsidizing insurance , but also subsidizing less of it than Obamacare does , and that the scope of the existing insurance model is making both the income and the substitution effects larger than they need to be . This is basically the theory behind the most plausible conservative alternative  a flat subsidy for catastrophic coverage  to the health care law we actually got . And though liberals mostly reject it , I think its a theory worth entertaining even if you believe absolutely in the kind of redistribution inherent in Obamacare  because even granted the pro-redistribution premise its still not obvious that subsidizing comprehensive insurance is the best way to go about it .Think about it this way . The welfare state delivers a basket of subsidies to lower-income Americans . Some of these subsidies take the form of cash , and some are direct subsidies for various goods ( food , housing , health insurance ) . Some are tied to work  the earned income tax credit is the notable example  and some of them are not . Pre-Obamacare , the main subsidy for health insurance was tied to work , which both conservatives and liberals tend to regard as a less-than-ideal design ; it was also open-ended and regressive , making it a lousy deal for low-income Americans , period .So we can agree that we should be transitioning away from that model . But theres no necessary reason why , in the course of that transition , we should just set the new health care share of the low-income basket at the levels suggested by the existing insurance model , when that model plainly isnt delivering value for those dollars overall . Maybe , instead , it would make more sense to take some of the money that Obamacare spends chasing the goal of comprehensive coverage and spend it , say , on giving single workers some of the same E.I.T.C . benefits as families . Or on a larger child tax credit . Or on a straightforward payroll tax cut . Or  to pick a liberal cause , instead of a reform conservative idea  new experiments in universal pre-kindergarten !If severing health insurance from work inevitably reduces workforce participation , that doesnt mean we shouldnt gradually sever it , and seek to subsidize insurance in a different way . But it means that we should think seriously about what else we should be doing , and whether we should be spending as much as Obamacare spends on insurance when there are other transfers that might not offer as many work disincentives , might give a stronger boost to upward mobility , and might do more long-term good .On the last point , I dont want to rehearse the entire debate about catastrophic versus comprehensive coverage , and the good that health insurance does or doesnt do . Ill just note two recent items that I think are relevant to this debate . The first is a big Times story , running today:One of the largest and most meticulous studies of mammography ever done , involving 90,000 women and lasting a quarter-century , has added powerful new doubts about the value of the screening test for women of any age .It found that the death rates from breast cancer and from all causes were the same in women who got mammograms and those who did not . And the screening had harms : One in five cancers found with mammography and treated was not a threat to the womans health and did not need treatment such as chemotherapy , surgery or radiation .The study , published Tuesday in The British Medical Journal , is one of the few rigorous evaluations of mammograms conducted in the modern era of more effective breast cancer treatments . It randomly assigned Canadian women to have regular mammograms and breast exams by trained nurses or to have breast exams alone .Researchers sought to determine whether there was any advantage to finding breast cancers when they were too small to feel . The answer is no , the researchers report .The second is a study published this month in the Journal of Development Economics . Heres the executive summary:We examine the impact of removing user fees for healthcare in rural Ghana using data from a randomized experiment that includes rich information on objective measures of child health status . We find that free care increased use of formal healthcare shifting care seeking away from informal providers , with particularly strong effects for children who were anaemic at baseline . There was no health effect on the intervention population taken overall . [ emphasis mine  R.D . ] However , consistent with the utilization findings , there were health improvements amongst those with anaemia initially . Further benefits included a large reduction in health spending , with the effect greater at higher levels of the medical spending distribution . Free care was found to have no influence on a range of malaria prevention behaviours or on the incidence of self-reported illness , suggesting that ex-ante moral hazard is unlikely to be a concern in this particular setting .If you want a reason to doubt the wisdom of redistribution-via-insurance , these are the places to start : In the evidence , widespread and accumulating , that what we spend on medical treatment  and what the government spends for us  does not have a clear connection to how healthy we are and how long we live .This evidence does not make the case for excluding health insurance , and the financial protection it supplies , when you design a safety net . But it does make a case against Obamacare as designed , especially given some of the trade-offs that design requires . And it makes a positive case for deploying resources somewhat differently , focusing more on the nexus of work and money income , and spending less on a benefit that can only be spent in ways that dont seem to be producing the promised results ."
-1	"LATER this month , the Supreme Court will rule on the Obama administrations health care law , the Affordable Care Act , deciding whether to uphold or strike down the entire law , or to keep some provisions .No matter the decision , the political ramifications in this election year will be big . After all , the presidential contenders are President Obama , the top-ranking promoter of the law , and Mitt Romney , the architect of a 2006 health care overhaul in Massachusetts that was , in pivotal ways , the model for the national law .But experts on health care policy say the practical effect of the courts decision will probably be less earth-shattering than some people think . If the court takes what many observers believe will be the most likely route and strikes down the individual mandate  the requirement that virtually everyone purchase insurance  many more currently uninsured people are still likely to receive health coverage , they say .Even if the law is struck down entirely  which could happen if the court decides that the other provisions are too intertwined with the mandate  many experts say that some changes the law has already set in motion will continue , probably more slowly , but possibly at a more urgent pace in reaction to the elimination of the federal law .It would have less effect in the short term than most people might think , but it would have much more of a psychological and political effect ,  said Gail Wilensky , a health economist who headed Medicare and Medicaid during the administration of the elder President Bush . She suggested that , while the individual mandate seems vulnerable to being ruled unconstitutional , striking down the entire law seems highly unlikely , and to my way of thinking , highly undesirable , because I think its unnecessary.And if the law is upheld ? More people will get coverage , but significant problems in the health care system will remain . Chief among them is the high cost of medical care . Massachusetts , for example , has only begun to tackle the issue of health care costs , with proposals in the State Legislature that were introduced this year .Still , nationally , there are now some pilot programs by insurers and hospitals trying to tackle pieces of the cost problem on their own .I think much of the transformation of the health care delivery system is moving forward , regardless of the court action ,  said Karen Davis , the president of the Commonwealth Fund , a nonpartisan research foundation in New York . How do we get more efficient ? How do we keep people out of hospitals ? People are kind of gearing up for this . Thats going to continue . Obviously , it will continue at a faster pace if some of the payments for quality and efficiency in the law continue , but we are already beginning to see a slowdown in hospital costs nationally.Most of the major elements of the Affordable Care Act have not taken effect , and would not until 2014 . The full law would extend coverage to about 30 million uninsured people  roughly 17 million of those would be covered through an expansion of state Medicaid programs to include everyone earning up to 138 percent of the income established as the federal poverty line . The Medicaid expansion could still take place if the individual mandate were to be struck down , a number of health care experts say .The individual mandate would require that millions of uninsured people who are not eligible for Medicaid purchase insurance or that their employers provide it . Subsidies would be available through insurance exchanges , and those who could not show a valid reason for not purchasing insurance would pay a penalty on their income taxes .If the individual mandate is eliminated , but the exchanges remain , significant numbers of uninsured people are likely to purchase insurance anyway , said Amy Lischko , who served in Mr. Romneys administration when he was governor and helped craft the Massachusetts health care overhaul ."
-1	"Ezra Klein , in his new capacity as one of the impresarios behind Vox , has written a pair of attention-grabbing posts  here , and then here  defending the proposition that Obamacare has , in some sense , won ,  and that conservatives who cant come to terms with that victory cant come to terms with reality itself . Reading them , it struck me that this argument would benefit from laying down some specific markers for the near future , because Klein seems to move back and forth between two definitions of success . At times , as when he writes that Obamacare has won its survival and allows that that there are still many good critiques to make of the law , he seems to be using a narrow definition , with which I mostly agree  the law wont collapse under its own weight , the enrollment levels are high enough to make a return to the coverage status quo ante unlikely , etc . But when he uses language like the individual mandate  is working and the law is back on its expected track ,  and concludes that  [ Kathleen Sebelius ] can leave with the law she helped build looking , shockingly , like a success ,  it implies a stronger definition of victory , in which Obamacare isnt just continuing , isnt just unlikely to be swiftly repealed , but is clearly succeeding as a policy in basically the way its advocates predicted that it would .So I think it would be useful for the laws supporters to specify the metrics/numbers/outcomes that would vindicate the latter claim . Here are three fronts where specificity would be helpful:Enrollment . In the summer of 2012 , after the Supreme Court decision freeing up states to reject the Medicaid expansion , the C.B.O . projected that 14 million Americans would get coverage under Obamacare in the first year , and 33 million by 2022 . This February , after the botched rollout , the projections were 13 million in 2014 , 27 million in the long run . The latest estimate , out this month , drops the 2014 projection down to 12 million , and the long-term number to 26 million . Meanwhile , the question of how many previously-uninsured people have gained insurance as of right now is , as this Vox explainer suggests , quite difficult to answer ( and sadly , it may be about to become even more difficult ) , but a guesstimate of 9-10 million seems pretty plausible  and short , N.B. , of even the C.B.O.s more modest projection for this year .So  how low can the numbers go before they start to make the law look like something less than a success ? I assume that liberals will declare victory , with some reason , if Obamacare meets the C.B.O.s current ( reduced ) expectations , this year and beyond . But what if it doesnt ? Suppose that by the end of 2016 , when the C.B.O . expects the total number of uninsured to have fallen by 25 million , its only fallen by , say , 15 million instead  and most of the previously uninsured are getting coverage through Medicare , while the exchanges are mostly populated by people whose prior individual-market coverage was cancelled , either in 2014 or once grandfathering runs out . Will that be a success story ? Presumably theres some kind of shortfall that the laws supporters would consider , if not a sign of outright failure , than at least a reason to be fairly disappointed with how Obamacare has worked . It would be helpful to know what they think that long-run number lies .The cost curve . Before we entered into the agony of the botched roll-out , the laws supporters were eagerly citing the persistently low rate of health care inflation as a sign that Obamacare was already working as designed , already having a beneficial effect . But as Voxs Sarah Kliff reported yesterday , the latest inflation numbers cast some doubt on that hopeful hypothesis , with federal data indicating that health care spending is now growing just as quickly as it was prior to the recession.Now this may be temporary : Some kind of cost inflation was always likely to be associated with this years roll-out of subsidies and Medicaid spending , and the laws supporters can reasonably argue that we should wait a few years , until the coverage expansion ( however large ) has become a normal feature of the system , to judge Obamacares impact on inflation overall .But at a certain point that judgment will need to be made . So , again , what should be the standard ? What should be the baseline ? Does Obamacare need to hold inflation to the low 2011-2012 pace ( a pace , again , that many liberals wanted to credit to its early impact ) in order to be counted as a cost-containing success ? Does it just need to hold inflation below , say , a 10 or 20-year average ? ( Note that both on its own terms and relative to overall inflation , health cost inflation had been declining for seven years before Obamacare was passed  so just holding either rate below the average of 2000-2010 would not actually be that impressive . ) In other words  what does the Affordable Care Act have to achieve in order to live up to its name ?Health outcomes . Its been crowded out by the website drama like everything else , but one of the major divides between Obamacare supporters and skeptics was over whether , and to what extent , the law would literally be a lifesaver  with writers like Klein famously invoking lives saved figures in the hundreds of thousands during the run-up to the laws passage , while doubters cited the surprisingly-weak link between insurance status and health outcomes , and raised the potential public-health downsides , in terms of innovations lost or never sought , of increasing government control .Now public health data can be even fuzzier and more debatable than cost inflation and enrollment numbers . But even with lower-than-hoped-for enrollment figures overall , we should still be able to see some of the happy consequences , at some point , if Klein et . al . are right : Looking back from 2020 or 2025 , certainly , there should be some kind of disjuncture between U.S. health outcomes pre- and post-Obamacare ( maybe a reversal of this trend , at the very least ? ) , and some kind of outcomes gap should open between states that implemented the law fully and states that refused the extra Medicaid dollars .So here , too , Im curious what liberals expect to see , what theyll count as vindication , what would disappoint them , and what kind of results they think will be sufficient to prove that Obamacare is , in fact , a lifesaving success .And then for my own part , Ill lay down this marker for the future : If , in 2023 , the uninsured rate is where the C.B.O . currently projects or lower , health inflations five-year average is running below the post-World War II norm , and the trend in the age-adjusted mortality rate shows a positive alteration starting right about now , I will write a post ( or send out a Singularity-wide transmission , maybe ) entitled I Was Wrong About Obamacare  or , if he prefers , just Ezra Klein Was Right."
-1	"AT Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center , we recently made a decision that should have been a no-brainer : we are not going to give a phenomenally expensive new cancer drug to our patients .The reasons are simple : The drug , Zaltrap , has proved to be no better than a similar medicine we already have for advanced colorectal cancer , while its price  at $ 11,063 on average for a month of treatment  is more than twice as high .In most industries something that offers no advantage over its competitors and yet sells for twice the price would never even get on the market . But that is not how things work for drugs . The Food and Drug Administration approves drugs if they are shown to be safe and effective. It does not consider what the relative costs might be once the new medicine is marketed .By law , Medicare must cover every cancer drug the F.D.A . approves . ( A 2003 law , moreover , mandates payment at the price the manufacturers charge , plus a 6 percent cushion . ) In most states private insurers are held to this same standard . Physician guideline-setting organizations likewise focus on whether or not a treatment is effective , and rarely factor in cost in their determinations .Ignoring the cost of care , though , is no longer tenable . Soaring spending has presented the medical community with a new obligation . When choosing treatments for a patient , we have to consider the financial strains they may cause alongside the benefits they might deliver .This is particularly the case with cancer , where the cost of drugs , and of care over all , has risen precipitously . The typical new cancer drug coming on the market a decade ago cost about $ 4,500 per month ( in 2012 dollars ) ; since 2010 the median price has been around $ 10,000 . Two of the new cancer drugs cost more than $ 35,000 each per month of treatment .The burden of this cost is borne , increasingly , by patients themselves  and the effects can be devastating . In 2006 , one-quarter of cancer patients reported that they had used up all or most of their savings paying for care ; a study last year reported that 2 percent of cancer patients were driven into bankruptcy by their illness and its treatment . One in 10 cancer patients now reports spending more than $ 18,000 out of pocket on care .Which brings us back to our decision on Zaltrap . In patients with advancing , metastatic colorectal cancer , the new drug , approved by the F.D.A . in August and jointly marketed by Sanofi and Regeneron , offers the same survival benefit as Genentechs Avastin , which works through a similar molecular mechanism . When compared with the standard chemotherapy regimen alone , adding either medicine has been shown to prolong patient lives by a median of 1.4 months . Major clinical practice guidelines , like those from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network , agree that Zaltrap is no better than Avastin in this setting . ( Full disclosure : Two of us , Dr. Bach and Dr. Saltz , have been paid consulting fees by Genentech . )But Avastin costs roughly $ 5,000 a month : very expensive in its own right , yet less than half of Zaltraps price tag . And while the side effects in both drugs are roughly equal , doses of Avastin generally take less time to administer than those of Zaltrap , which makes Avastin more convenient for patients .Consider that colorectal cancer is typically diagnosed in older individuals and the cost issue becomes starker still . Many patients are on Medicare and living on fixed incomes . And because Medicare requires patients to co-pay for cancer drugs , 20 percent of the cost of drugs like Zaltrap and Avastin is passed on  absorbed either by supplemental insurance or by the patients themselves .To put these percentages in perspective , an older colorectal cancer patient without extra insurance would have to pay more than $ 2,200 out of pocket for a months treatment with Zaltrap . Thats greater than the monthly income for half of Medicare participants .Once you take all this into account it may seem surprising that the decision to exclude Zaltrap from our hospitals formulary was a hard one to make . But because our medical culture equates new with better so unequivocally , a decision like this one can seem out of place at a leading cancer hospitalPolitical rhetoric today is similarly slanted . Our refusal to adopt this remarkably expensive therapy risks being labeled rationing ,  not rational .This political climate also helps explain why the Affordable Care Act precludes Medicare from changing its coverage or payment amounts based on cost comparisons like the one we have outlined , even when two drugs appear to work equally well . And it is probably why neither presidential candidate has addressed runaway cancer drug prices .But if no one else will act , leading cancer centers and other research hospitals should . The future of our health care system , and of cancer care , depends on our using our limited resources wisely .The current level of spending on health care , estimated to be $ 2.8 trillion this year , is already too high . The growth rate in health spending is unsustainable .Of course , we know our decision about Zaltrap will not meaningfully address these larger problems . Projected United States sales of Zaltrap in 2013 are less than $ 150 million , or 0.005 percent of all dollars spent on health care . Our use would account for a very small percentage of even that number .But it is a step in the right direction  one of many we need to take ."
-1	"DURHAM , N.C.  IF an antibiotic would cure your infection , your doctor would probably still warn you about the chance of sun sensitivity before prescribing the pill .But even when the costs of a medical intervention might force patients to choose between paying the bill or keeping up with their mortgages , American physicians rarely discuss that serious side effect with them . One physician recently explained to me that he felt money talk would violate the doctor-patient relationship.Given how much attention we have been focusing on health care costs and the Affordable Care Act , now is the time to change such thinking .In The New England Journal of Medicine last month , two colleagues and I wrote an essay intended for physicians ; we argued that they should discuss out-of-pocket costs with patients just as they discuss any side effects . After all , the financial burden of paying for medical care can cause more distress in patients lives than many medical side effects , and patients can decide whether any of the downsides of treatment are justified by the benefits .Take , for example , a patient with colon cancer whose oncologist is considering prescribing Avastin . Most physicians would go out of their way to warn that this drug could harm a patients heart ; the data show that it carries a 2 percent risk of cardiovascular toxicity . But few physicians would discuss the price , even though Avastin can cost more than $ 50,000 per patient , and a Medicare patient without supplemental insurance could be responsible for nearly $ 9,000 of that .The Affordable Care Act will have only a modest impact on patient exposure to health care costs because the limits it sets on out-of-pocket costs are still high compared with most peoples resources . And in the last six years , according to the Kaiser Family Foundation , weve seen a threefold increase in the number of people choosing high-deductible plans .The Center for American Progress estimates that a breast-cancer patient in Massachusetts with a high-deductible plan could face more than $ 50,000 in medical expenses . Thats more than the average lifetime savings of the majority of American families .In our New England Journal article , we tried to convince physicians that they needed to start incorporating the cost of care into their clinical conversations . But patients should not be afraid to take the lead and ask how much a pill or procedure will cost . Far too often , patients bring up such questions only after they have already experienced treatment-related financial distress . My colleagues and I confirmed that during interviews with breast cancer survivors ; in a number of cases , the physician had told the patient that if she had only mentioned a concern about the cost earlier , the doctor could have suggested less expensive alternatives .That kind of lapse should never happen . No one should have to suffer unnecessarily from the cost of medical care . Simply put , discussing costs in the doctors office is good medicine ."
-1	"NESTLED within the many commendable aspects of President Obamas health care plan  including the individual mandate  sits a problem that has gone virtually unnoticed by commentators obsessed with the Supreme Courts review of the law : how to pay for it .About 65 percent of the cost of the Obama health care law is supposed to be met by Medicare expense reductions and tax increases totaling roughly $ 1 trillion over 10 years . The deficiency with this plan is that it amounts to double-counting , using urgently needed Medicare economies to finance the new law .Dont get me wrong : We need to extract all sensible savings from Medicare and consider revenue increases to ensure its solvency as baby boomers swell its rolls . Thanks to escalating health care costs and repeated sweetening of benefits without commensurate increases in revenues , Medicare was underfinanced by a staggering $ 37 trillion as of Sept. 30 .Thats the amount  about two and a half times the annual output of the United States economy  that would have to be deposited into the Medicare trust funds to adhere to the principle that members of each generation would contribute enough to Medicare while they were working to pay for their care after age 65 .But the politics of Medicare have been poisonous , so toxic that Democrats havent been willing to engage seriously on the issue , while Republicans have advanced a proposal that would eviscerate Medicare rather than preserve it .The current effort to trim Medicare costs , through initiatives like limiting payment increases to health care providers , amounts to picking the low-hanging fruit . What comes next will surely be more painful and contentious .Given that context , the governments accounting practice  counting $ 748 billion of cost savings and $ 259 billion of revenue increases toward both Medicare and the cost of the Obama plan  is particularly troubling . Moreover , this problem is largely hidden from public view .Under Washingtons delusional rules , budget crunchers in both the White House and Congress credit this $ 1 trillion twice : once in calculating that the care law will generate more revenues than costs , and again in concluding that the Obama plan will chip away at the Medicare problem .Unfortunately , the real world does not permit the luxury of double-counting . The truth is that the law will either be fully paid for or it will begin to address the Medicare problem  but not both .Theres no doubt that both parties have similarly gamed the system over the years . Back in 1997 , $ 247 billion of expected Medicare savings was funneled into tax cuts and a childrens health plan as part of a deficit reduction package negotiated by President Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich , the Republican speaker .That bit of history merits close attention , because those efforts to cap reimbursements to providers proved unrealistic and were mostly never realized .While the Obama legislation employs cutting-edge ideas for managing Medicares outlays , the program cant be saved just by squeezing reimbursement rates to hospitals , laboratories and the like . In assessing the new law , the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services warned of exactly these risks .To properly address the competing needs of the Affordable Care Act and Medicare , lets start with more transparency . The government should act like a company that provides investors with separate profit and loss data for different divisions  without double-counting . Next we need a better plan for financing the health care law , which will be challenging because actually paying for federal programs ( that is , increasing taxes ) has become a no-go zone in Washington .Thats further complicated by the admirably redistributionist nature of the Obama law . The preponderance of the Affordable Care Acts costs go toward extending insurance coverage to an estimated 30 million Americans making less than $ 44,000 per year ( or $ 89,000 per year for a family of four ) , about 10 percent of the population .Meanwhile , a hefty chunk of the new revenues comes from increased taxes on the earnings and other income ( like dividends and interest ) of affluent individuals , and an excise tax on employers offering so-called Cadillac health plans .Its fine to ask the wealthiest to pay disproportionately for important social programs . But the top taxpayers , who are already on the hook for around $ 260 billion of the laws costs , cant be expected to shoulder the entire $ 1 trillion burden that would flow from intellectually honest accounting .At a time of trillion-dollar deficits , new initiatives must be paid for in reality , not just the world of Washington arithmetic . The effort to curb Medicare costs must continue and accelerate  but all sides need to be more honest by counting these savings just once , not twice ."
-1	"WashingtonIN the days leading up to the Supreme Courts health care decision , rumors began to circulate in Washington that the justices had decided to uphold the law . Liberals around town who might have reason to know the outcome seemed happy , according to the gossip , and a couple of conservative justices had seemed angry when the court met three days before the announcement . On the eve of the ruling , a few respected court watchers went so far as to predict publicly that the law would be upheld .It is impossible to know how much of the gossip sprang from actual information . Several dozen people  the justices , their clerks , other members of the court staff  did indeed know the outcome in advance . Although they have a record of discretion exceeding even that of some parts of the national security apparatus , they are human . They have friends and relatives , and they have emotions .With the rumors swirling , I began to check the odds at Intrade , the online prediction market where people can bet on real-world events , several times a day . The odds had barely budged . They continued to show about a 75 percent chance that the laws so-called mandate would be ruled unconstitutional , right up until the morning it was ruled constitutional .The market  the wisdom of crowds  turned out to be wrong .I have since come to think of the courts ruling as the signature example of the counterattack of the insiders . After the better part of a decade in which various markets , from Intrade to the stock market , became many peoples preferred way to peer into the future , a backlash is clearly under way . Not so long ago , knowing about the existence of Intrade was a mark of being in the vanguard . Today , mocking Intrade , ideally on Twitter , is a sign of sophistication .This development matters because predictions matter . They allow government officials , corporate executives and citizens to plan for the future . They are an unavoidable part of life .The rise of prediction markets started in the middle of the last decade , brought about by a combination of politics , psychology and technology . The politics came mostly from the aftermath of the Iraq war , when the collective , pro-invasion opinion of Washington experts came to look tragically wrongheaded . The psychology came from a barrage of research , often called behavioral economics , that created a science of human foibles . People were systematically too confident , the research found . They put too much weight on information they liked and too little on data that contradicted their assumptions .The only good alternative to a few flawed opinions , some researchers argued , was a vast number of flawed opinions . The biases often canceled one another out . The legitimate information rose to the surface . It was the wisdom of crowds , as the writer James Surowiecki called his 2004 book .The Internet made collecting the wisdom of crowds vastly easier than before . Intrade , Betfair and other British and Irish betting sites became the public face of prediction markets . Google and other companies started their own internal prediction markets to help them make decisions about where to invest . The Pentagon planned one , to track threats , before deciding it did not like the image of American officials making bets about war and famine .The early successes of prediction markets were notable . To take a small personal example , my wife and I , not exactly frequent moviegoers , twice won money in a large Oscars pool simply by hewing to the British odds . Much more significantly , Intrade was a more reliable guide to the 2006 midterm election than cable networks . On election night , its odds showed that the Democrats had become the favorites to retake the Senate , while television commentators were still telling viewers it was unlikely .But the crowd was not everywhere wise . For one thing , many of the betting pools on Intrade and Betfair attract relatively few traders , in part because using them legally is cumbersome . ( No , I do not know from experience . ) The thinness of these markets can cause them to adjust too slowly to new information .And there is this : If the circle of people who possess information is small enough  as with the selection of a vice president or pope or , arguably , a decision by the Supreme Court  the crowds may not have much wisdom to impart . There is a class of markets that I think are basically pointless ,  says Justin Wolfers , an economist whose research on prediction markets , much of it with Eric Zitzewitz of Dartmouth , has made him mostly a fan of them . There is no widely available public information.These flaws have become fodder for the markets critics . On the day of the health care ruling , the widely read financial writers Barry Ritholtz , Felix Salmon and David Wessel all took to Twitter to point out that Intrade looked bad . Tony Fratto , a former aide to President George W. Bush , noted his real glee that Intrade was wrong , again.But such schadenfreude raises a question : once you accept that prediction markets are flawed , do you turn back to the inside experts ?ALAS , the experts overall record remains as poor as the behavioral economists maintained  and often worse than the markets record . Mutual fund managers , as a class , lose their clients money because they do not outperform the market and charge fees for their mediocrity . Sports pundits have a dismal record of predicting games relative to the Las Vegas odds , which are just another market price . As imperfect as prediction markets are in forecasting elections , they have at least as good a recent record as polls . Or consider the housing bubble : both the market and most experts missed it .The answer , I think , is to take the best of what both experts and markets have to offer , realizing that the combination of the two offers a better window onto the future than either alone . Markets are at their best when they can synthesize large amounts of disparate information , as on an election night . Experts are most useful when a system exists to identify the most truly knowledgeable  a system that often resembles a market .Sometimes , this approach involves a wisdom-of-crowds approach to experts . My colleague Nate Silver , whose book on prediction comes out later this year , has found that a simple average of well-known economic forecasts is substantially more accurate than individual forecasts . Other times , the approach might involve as much art as science  and , again , the Internet allows for strategies that once would have been impossible .Think for a moment about what a Twitter feed is : its a personalized market of experts ( and friends ) , in which you can build your own focus group and listen to its collective analysis about the past , present and future . An RSS feed , in which you choose blogs to read , works similarly . You make decisions about which experts are worthy of your attention , based both on your own judgments about them and on other experts judgments .Their predictions now face a market discipline that did not always exist before the Internet came along . Experts exist ,  as Mr. Wolfers says , but theyre not necessarily the same as the guys on TV.After several years in which the market was often celebrated as a crystal ball , the Supreme Court ruling was a useful corrective . The prediction-market revolution , like so many others , initially promised more than it could deliver . But its not as if the old order was working particularly well ."
-1	"WASHINGTON  IN the last few days of negotiations in Congress , repeal of the Affordable Care Acts tax on medical devices emerged as a key Republican demand . The medical-device industry waged an intense lobbying campaign  even garnering the support of many Democrats who favored the law  arguing that the tax would stifle innovation and increase health care costs .This argument is doubly disingenuous . Not only can the medical-device industry easily afford the tax without compromising innovation , but the industrys enormous profits are a result of anticompetitive practices that themselves drive up medical-device costs unnecessarily . The tax is a distraction from reforms to the industry that are urgently needed to lower health care costs .The medical-device industry faces virtually no price competition . Because of confidentiality agreements that manufacturers require hospitals to sign , the prices of the devices are cloaked in secrecy . This lack of transparency impedes hospitals from sharing price information and thus knowing whether they are getting a good deal .Even worse , manufacturers often maintain personal relationships ( sometimes involving financial payments like consulting fees ) with physicians who choose the medical devices that their hospitals purchase , creating a conflict of interest . Physicians often dont even know the costs of the devices , and individual physicians often choose devices on their own , which weakens a hospitals ability to bargain for volume discounts .Such anticompetitive practices help generate a wide variation in the prices of medical devices  and contribute to higher prices in general . For example , the Government Accountability Office found that prices for cardiac implantable medical devices in the United States vary by several thousand dollars . And even the lowest-priced devices in the United States are expensive compared with those in other developed countries . According to the consulting firm McKinsey & Company , the United States spends about 50 percent more than expected on the top five medical devices , compared with Europe and Japan . McKinsey calculates that this amounts to $ 26 billion in excessive spending each year . Medicare , private health insurers and patients end up paying these inflated prices .Excessive prices fuel enormous profits  profits that dwarf both the medical-device tax and the industrys investments in research and development . Consider the device division of Johnson & Johnson , which in 2012 had an operating profit of $ 7.2 billion . By the companys own estimate , the device tax would amount to at most $ 300 million , and its investment in research and development amounts to only $ 1.7 billion .There are several ways policy makers could lower device costs . The first step would be to end the anticompetitive practices that prevent hospitals from getting the best deals . Senator Charles E. Grassley , Republican of Iowa , has sponsored legislation that would foster transparency by posting online price information for implantable medical devices .In addition , instead of simply paying hospitals based in part on what they have spent on devices , Medicare should force manufacturers to compete for business based on a products price and quality .Medicare should also pay hospitals a single lump sum for all of the associated costs of a given procedure ( like a hip replacement ) . This approach , known as bundling the costs , would create incentives for hospitals to lower device costs . Savings should be shared with the physicians , so that their incentives are aligned with the hospitals .Bundling has been used successfully in pilot programs . Under Medicares Acute Care Episode Program  which bundled payments for cardiac and orthopedic procedures  physicians worked together to choose high-quality , cost-effective devices . Baptist Health System in Texas , which participated in the program , used clinical evidence to choose devices and negotiated lower prices for both Medicare and non-Medicare patients .States could adopt similar payment reforms for private insurance and their Medicaid programs . In Arkansas , the Medicaid program and private payers  including Walmart  have collaborated to adopt bundled payments for several procedures , including hip and knee replacements .To complement these efforts , the new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute , a nongovernmental body created by the Affordable Care Act , should pay for research that compares the effectiveness of devices so physicians can make informed choices . ( Three years into its existence , the institute has initiated few , if any , studies of medical devices . ) Medicare or the Food and Drug Administration should also require the use of registries that track when devices fail .Currently , medical-device manufacturers allocate only a sliver of profits to research and development and often focus on tweaks to existing devices , without providing any evidence that they are of better quality . Competitive pressures from public and private payers would provide incentives for the industry to become more innovative , producing technologies that actually lowered costs and offered truly advanced breakthroughs .Instead of using its clout to lobby against the device tax  which helped foment opposition to the Affordable Care Act  the medical-device industry needs to share the responsibility of lowering costs for patients , businesses and taxpayers ."
-1	"My post yesterday on the new study of post-Romneycare mortality rates in Massachusetts set up a contrast between two policy scenarios : One in which health insurance expansions have a substantial effect on health ( as the Massachusetts mortality data suggests ) , and another in which insurances connection to public health is much more limited ( as the data from the Oregon Medicaid experiment had indicated ) .But theres also a third possibility , which Avik Roy  who knows the Romneycare story as well as anyone on the right  elaborates on here . It may be , he argues , that private insurance does improve outcomes but Medicaid mostly does not , and that the Massachusetts effect is the result of private coverage expanding in that state much faster than in the country as whole . ( There was also a Medicaid expansion under Romneycare , but it accounted for a very modest portion of the newly-insured . )This is a very important issue , obviously  if Roy is right , then even in the light of the Massachusetts data Republican opposition to the Medicaid expansion isnt as deadly as its liberal critics insist  and it will be interesting to see if we end up with Obamacare-era studies that successfully address it . In terms of policy implications , better outcomes for private insurance would tend to make the case for a reform of Obamacare that privatizes low-income coverage and moves Medicaid beneficiaries onto the exchanges ( as Roy and other conservatives have proposed ) , and against the kind of Medicaid-for-most scenario that lies at the end of at least one left-of-center policy path .On the other hand , even if Roy is correct it wouldnt settle the crucial question of how much private coverage people need to purchase to see significant health gains . If most of the mortality improvements were associated with expensive comprehensive coverage , then migrating people from Medicaid to private insurance would only get you better outcomes at a much steeper fiscal price , which neither party ( and yes , especially the G.O.P . ) is particularly eager to pay .Anyway , well see what the future holds , and what the next big study says . ( And so we beat on , boats against the current , borne back ceaselessly into the health care debate  )"
-1	"NELSONS doctors found the bulge in his abdomen on a Monday . An ultrasound and CT scan showed that a mass was crowding out his stomach and kidneys . It was one of the largest the doctors had ever seen . If they didnt do something , hed be dead in a couple of days .The hospital gave him a blood transfusion because he was anemic . A radiologist noticed that something might be wrong with his adrenal gland . His surgical team removed what turned out to be a 12.5-pound tumor , lifting it out like an overgrown newborn . Nelsons intensive care nurse called his family that night , and his internists gave them regular updates until he was discharged .Nelsons health insurance covered 90 percent of the costs after a reasonable $ 500 deductible . Im happy he has such good health coverage . Hes my dog . And Im jealous of him .He has the kind of health care that Id hoped the Affordable Care Act would usher in for those who , like my wife and me , have to buy health insurance on the open market . Id long been frustrated at how health care shackles people to corporate jobs . I believed this legislation , signed four years ago this month , would free people to pursue their dreams , start new companies and not worry about the health insurance penalty .What I didnt count on was that it would make things harder for me and my wife .First , we were notified that we would be kicked out of our existing $ 263-a-month Anthem Blue Cross plan because it didnt meet the minimum standards of the new law . No problem , I thought . The plans in the new Covered California exchange would most likely be better and cheaper .But we were shocked at what we confronted . The least expensive premium for a couple like us in our 40s would be about $ 620 a month . And because our household adjusted gross income is likely to be over the $ 62,040 cutoff this year , its doubtful well end up with a subsidy to help offset that price increase .Having always had insurance , we began to wonder if we might have to go uninsured , but in the end , we enrolled . Its as if we just bought a new car that we will never see and that we can never pay off .The gulf between my health care world and my dogs was driven home the other week . I have mild asthma . Normally its not a problem , but when I get a chest cold , it becomes severe . One recent day I found that I couldnt breathe . My inhalers were all expired . Id held off refilling them since my insurance would reduce the costs of the $ 58.99 inhalers only by a little more than $ 9 . I knew from past experience that I probably needed a prescription for antibiotics , so I tried frantically to find a medical facility that would take our new Covered California Anthem Blue Cross bronze plan . When I did , they said it would be three weeks before I could see a doctor . Instead , I went to the drugstore and bought all the nonprescription medication that might help .Around the same time , Nelson developed a skin infection . I got an appointment at the vets the next day . They prescribed an antibiotic and did some blood tests . The medication caused diarrhea so I called his internist at his vet hospital , PetCare , and she prescribed a probiotic . Nelsons $ 40.42-a-month pet insurance isnt perfect  for instance it doesnt cover pre-existing conditions  but it paid almost all of these costs , and the vet followed up to make sure he was doing O.K .I was envious . My 11-year-old brown Labrador was getting the kind of treatment that I could only dream of . I wanted to go to PetCare . I wanted pet insurance .I know that Obamacare is helping a great number of people . I understand that for the first time millions of people are getting health insurance . Its the one thing that gives me solace .But lets not pretend that this new policy is the affordable health care savior that many of us were hoping for . For us , our new plan is a big financial hit for a product that does not make it any easier to get basic health care .Its still hard to understand what coverage we have . Its like trying to read tea leaves . Benefits descriptions can be contradictory and run nearly 200 pages long . One summary attached to my online account seems to say that if I go to the emergency room , I could potentially owe thousands of dollars . Another document suggests that Im responsible for only $ 300 . Ive had two representatives give me two different explanations . The more I questioned these well-intentioned people , the more I realized how confused , overwhelmed and at times plain wrong they were .Heres what Ive been able to piece together . Previously , our family deductible totaled $ 13,600 for outpatient care and $ 6,600 for hospital care ( with a maximum combined out-of-pocket cost of $ 13,600 ) . Under our new plan , we have a deductible of $ 10,000 ( and an out-of-pocket maximum of $ 12,700 ) . In both cases , having deductibles that high means this is largely insurance to make sure that we dont go bankrupt if we become very ill . Yes , the new plan has more coverage , including pediatric vision . But we dont have children , and Id trade coverage for things like substance abuse treatment and mental health in return for lower premiums .And if you see a doctor outside your network , look out . We found this out the hard way . My wife and I both had to see a doctor in January . Our old policy and our new Covered California policy were both with Anthem Blue Cross , so a representative there told us to use our old ID cards for our visits since our new cards hadnt arrived yet . We were covered , he assured us . At the medical center , we gave our ID cards to the receptionist , who accepted them as valid , and went in to see our regular doctors . But later we found out that they were not in our new networks plan . The out-of-pocket cost for my simple 30-minute office visit : $ 303 . My wifes annual exam and a couple of minor procedures : $ 918 .Were still waiting for quality health care that we can actually use , afford and understand  the kind of care that Nelson gets ."
-1	"FRANKFORT , Ky.  SUNDAY morning news programs identify Kentucky as the red state with two high-profile Republican senators who claim their rhetoric represents an electorate that gave President Obama only about a third of its presidential vote in 2012 .So why then is Kentucky  more quickly than almost any other state  moving to implement the Affordable Care Act ?Because theres a huge disconnect between the rank partisanship of national politics and the outlook of governors whose job it is to help beleaguered families , strengthen work forces , attract companies and create a balanced budget .Its no coincidence that numerous governors  not just Democrats like me but also Republicans like Jan Brewer of Arizona , John Kasich of Ohio and Rick Snyder of Michigan  see the Affordable Care Act not as a referendum on President Obama but as a tool for historic change .That is especially true in Kentucky , a state where residents collective health has long been horrendous . The state ranks among the worst , if not the worst , in almost every major health category , including smoking , cancer deaths , preventable hospitalizations , premature death , heart disease and diabetes .Were making progress , but incremental improvements are not enough . We need big solutions with the potential for transformational change .The Affordable Care Act is one of those solutions .For the first time , we will make affordable health insurance available to every single citizen in the state . Right now , 640,000 people in Kentucky are uninsured . Thats almost one in six Kentuckians .Lack of health coverage puts their health and financial security at risk .They roll the dice and pray they dont get sick . They choose between food and medicine . They ignore checkups that would catch serious conditions early . They put off doctors appointments , hoping a condition turns out to be nothing . And they live knowing that bankruptcy is just one bad diagnosis away .Furthermore , their children go long periods without checkups that focus on immunizations , preventive care and vision and hearing tests . If they have diabetes , asthma or infected gums , their conditions remain untreated and unchecked .For Kentucky as a whole , the negative impact is similar but larger  jacked-up costs , decreased worker productivity , lower quality of life , depressed school attendance and a poor image .The Affordable Care Act will address these weaknesses .Some 308,000 of Kentuckys uninsured  mostly the working poor  will be covered when we increase Medicaid eligibility guidelines to 138 percent of the federal poverty level .PricewaterhouseCoopers and the Urban Studies Institute at the University of Louisville concluded that expanding Medicaid would inject $ 15.6 billion into Kentuckys economy over the next eight years , create almost 17,000 new jobs , have an $ 802.4 million positive budget impact ( by transferring certain expenditures from the state to the federal government , among other things ) , protect hospitals from cuts in indigent care funding and shield businesses from up to $ 48 million in annual penalties .In short , we couldnt afford not to do it .The other 332,000 uninsured Kentuckians will be able to access affordable coverage  most with a discount  through the Health Benefit Exchange , the online insurance marketplace we named Kynect : Kentuckys Healthcare Connection .Kentucky is the only Southern state both expanding Medicaid and operating a state-based exchange , and we remain on target to meet the Oct. 1 deadline to open Kynect with the support of a call center that is providing some 100 jobs . Having been the first state-based exchange to complete the readiness review with the United States Department of Health and Human Services , we hope to become the first one to be certified .Frankly , we cant implement the Affordable Care Act fast enough .As for naysayers , Im offended by their partisan gamesmanship , as they continue to pour time , money and energy into overturning or defunding the Affordable Care Act . Its shameful that these critics havent invested that same level of energy into trying to improve the health of our citizens .They insist that the Affordable Care Act will never work  when in fact a similar approach put into effect in Massachusetts by Mitt Romney , then the governor , is working .So , to those more worried about political power than Kentuckys families , I say , Get over it.The Affordable Care Act was approved by Congress and sanctioned by the Supreme Court . It is the law of the land .Get over it ... and get out of the way so I can help my people . Here in Kentucky , we can not afford to waste another day or another life ."
-1	"Durham , N.C .GIVEN the very real possibility that the Supreme Court will overturn the Affordable Care Act , liberals are concerned that the right-wing tilt of five justices and lifelong appointments ensure a decades-long assault on the power of Congress . This is especially likely given the relative youth of the blocs conservative members : an average of 66 years old , when the last 10 justices to retire did so at an average age of 78 .The situation brings to mind a proposal voiced most prominently by Gov . Rick Perry during his run for the Republican presidential nomination : judicial term limits .The idea isnt new . High-ranking judges in all major nations , and all 50 states , are subject to age or term limits . The power to invalidate legislation is , in a sense , the ultimate political power , and mortals who exercise it need constraint . So why not the highest court in the land ?One reason sometimes given is that Congress could not enact strict limits without amending Article III of the Constitution , which provides that justices hold office for the period of their good behavior. Long lives were uncommon in 1788 , so the issue of prolonged service was not considered by the framers .Instead , they simply borrowed the term good behavior from a law enacted by the English Parliament in 1701 to deter a king dissatisfied with a judicial decision from firing the judge who made it . Interestingly , that same Parliament has long since imposed age limits on its nations judges  as has virtually every national constitution written since 1789 .Indeed , Mr. Perry wasnt the first person to propose adjusting the political powers of our highest court , nor is the idea an exclusively conservative one . In 2009 a politically diverse group of law professors , including me , proposed a system that would work around the need to amend the Constitution  an extremely unlikely possibility  yet still capture the benefits of term limits .Heres how our plan would work . Every two years the president would appoint a new justice to the court , but only the nine most junior justices , by years of service , would sit and decide every case .The rest would then act as a sort of bench team , sitting on cases as needed because of the disability or disqualification of one of the junior justices . These senior justices might also help decide which of the thousands of petitions the court receives each year should be fully considered , vote on procedural rulemaking , and perhaps sit on occasional cases presented to lower circuit courts .In short , our proposal would revise the job of a justice to a more human scale and perhaps make the court less likely to impose erratic political preferences on the citizens it governs . Because it would assure regular turnover , the court would experience fewer long-term ideological swings , enabling it to better do its original job of anchoring the legislative process to the Constitution .The founders clearly intended to confer on Congress the power to define the number and role of justices . The Judiciary Act of 1789 set the number of justices at seven and imposed on them the duty to travel the nation in horse-drawn wagons to hear and decide cases .In 1800 the Federalists reduced the size of the court in an effort to deny President Jefferson an opportunity to make an appointment . The number rose to 10 during the Civil War to prevent those sympathizing with the Confederacy from doing harm to the Union .In 1937 , when the court was invalidating New Deal legislation , Congress considered a law adding justices , but the bill was defeated when the need for it was eliminated ( one justice unexpectedly upheld a challenged law ; another anti-New Deal justice retired ) .If five of our present justices broadly prohibit the federal government from providing accessible health care , Congress should consider using its constitutional power again to add two more justices  and impose a reasonable limit on the length of time that a mere mortal should hold so much political power ."

Now , thanks to HealthCare.gov , they know what a virtual waiting room looks like , too . Nearly 20 million Americans , in fact , have visited the Web site since it opened three weeks ago , but only about 500,000 managed to complete applications for insurance coverage . And an even smaller subset of those applicants actually obtained coverage .For the first time in history , a president has had to stand in the Rose Garden to apologize for a broken Web site . But HealthCare.gov is only the latest episode in a string of information technology debacles by the federal government . Indeed , according to the research firm the Standish Group , 94 percent of large federal information technology projects over the past 10 years were unsuccessful  more than half were delayed , over budget , or didnt meet user expectations , and 41.4 percent failed completely .For example , Sam.gov , a system for government contractors developed by I.B.M . that started in 2012 , has cost taxpayers $ 181 million and is just now beginning to work as expected . Before that , a new version of USAJobs.gov landed with a thud , after years during which millions were spent . In 2001 , the F.B.I . started a virtual case file system , and after dumping the project , renaming it , and finding new vendors to build it , the project , Sentinel ,  managed to see the light of day just last year .Clearly , these failures  though they are not as well known to the public  extend far beyond Barack Obamas presidency . But this latest stings more than the others . Perhaps thats because it comes from a president who is seen as a transformational figure , who has had to watch his signature achievement be held hostage by that most banal of captors : a clunky computer system .So why is it that the technology available to Mr. Obama as president doesnt compare to the technology he used to win an election ? Much of the problem has to do with the way the government buys things . The government has to follow a code called the Federal Acquisition Regulation , which is more than 1,800 pages of legalese that all but ensure that the companies that win government contracts , like the ones put out to build HealthCare.gov , are those that can navigate the regulations best , but not necessarily do the best job . Thats evidenced by yesterdays Congressional testimony by the largest of the vendors , CGI Federal , which blamed everyone but itself when asked to explain the botched rollout of the new Web site .But maybe theres hope . In 2004 , campaign contracting was a lot like government contracting is today : full of large , entrenched vendors providing subpar services . Howard Dean changed that by reaching out to a new breed of Internet-savvy companies and staffers ( including one of us ) . In 2012 , Barack Obama beat Mitt Romney thanks in part to a mix of private-sector-trained technology workers and a well-developed ecosystem of technologies available from competitive consultants .This latest failure is frustrating for us to watch . Our careers have largely been about developing technology that allows more people to participate in the way we finance , support and elect candidates for public office . Together , weve done things that transformed elections , but we now need that work to carry into transforming government .Government should be as participatory and as interactive with its citizens as our political process is . A digital candidate will never be able to become a digital president if he cant bring the innovation that helped him win election into the Oval Office to help him govern .HealthCare.gov needs to be fixed . We believe that in a few days it will be . As Mr. Obama said last week after the government shutdown ended , Theres no good reason why we cant govern responsibly , despite our differences , without lurching from manufactured crisis to manufactured crisis. Theres no good reason we cant code responsibly , either . We must find a fix to the federal procurement process that spares the governments technology projects from the self-inflicted wounds of signing big contracts whose terms repeatedly and spectacularly go unmet .The good news is that these problems are not unique to the United States government , and others already have solutions . In 2011 , the British government formed a new unit of its Cabinet Office called the Government Digital Service . Its a team of internal technologists whose job it is to either build the right technology , or find the right vendors for every need across the government . It gives the government a technical brain . It has saved the country millions , and improved the way the government delivers services online .The United States has taken a step in this direction . Last year , the governments chief technology officer , Todd Park , started the Presidential Innovation Fellows program and brought together innovators from across the country to work on hard technical problems inside of government . But we need to create our own Government Digital Service .The president should use the power of the White House to end all large information technology purchases , and instead give his administrations accomplished technologists the ability to work with agencies to make the right decisions , increase adoption of modern , incremental software development practices , like a popular one called Agile , already used in the private sector , and work with the Small Business Administration and the General Services Administration to make it easy for small businesses to contract with the government .Large federal information technology purchases have to end . Any methodology with a 94 percent chance of failure or delay , which costs taxpayers billions of dollars , doesnt belong in a 21st-century government ."
-1	"Most of the news coverage of the highly-anticipated contraceptive-mandate cases  which came before the Supreme Court on Tuesday morning  has focused on the idea of religious liberty , and to what degree a for-profit corporation can exercise that liberty like a real human person .But the real human persons at the center of the case  specifically , the women whose access to contraception is at stake  were notably absent from much of the conversation in the court . The case ( actually two cases consolidated into one ) arose after several businesses sued the federal government over the Affordable Care Acts requirement that they either provide their employees with comprehensive health insurance , which includes coverage for contraception , or pay a tax .The businesses owners are opposed for religious reasons to any contraceptive method that acts after an embryo has formed . Since some of the methods approved under the health-care law can work in that way , the owners charged that the government was violating their right to the free exercise of religion .At oral argument , there were plenty of questions over what precise legal standards to apply in the case ; how far the plaintiffs logic extended ( would it allow corporations to refuse to cover , say , vaccinations or blood transfusions ? ) ; and what would be the cost of the various choices available to the companies .More than half an hour of argument passed before Justice Anthony Kennedy , playing his familiar role somewhere between the liberal and conservative blocs on the court , brought the actual women into the picture . How would you suggest that we think about the position and the rights of the employees ?  Justice Kennedy asked Paul Clement , the attorney for the corporate plaintiffs . The employee may not agree with these religious beliefs of the employer . Does the religious beliefs just trump ? Is that the way it works ? Until then , you might have thought that the only human beings who would be affected by the courts decision were the owners of the companies themselves : Hobby Lobby Stores , Inc. , an Oklahoma-based arts-and-crafts chain owned by evangelical Christians , and Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp. , a Mennonite cabinet manufacturer from Pennsylvania .But Hobby Lobby alone has 13,000 employees , a significant portion of whom are women , or men with female partners who share their insurance . It is safe to assume that many if not most of them have used contraception . And contrary to Justice Antonin Scalias dismissive suggestion that cost isnt a factor ( Thats not terribly expensive stuff , is it ?  he said at one point ) the four methods at issue in the Hobby Lobby cases , such as IUDs , are among the most effective  and expensive . According to an amicus brief filed by reproductive-health experts , one third of American women say they would change their method of contraception if cost werent an issue .In other words , Hobby Lobbys decision not to provide insurance coverage could make it harder for its female employees to obtain basic health services now freely available to other women throughout the country .Of course , as Justice Kennedy knew when he asked about employee rights , any claim of religious liberty must be considered in the context of the possible burden that liberty imposes on other citizens . Solicitor General Donald Verrilli , who argued the case on behalf of the government , tried to make this point the centerpiece of his case from his opening words .Limitations which of necessity bound religious freedom begin to operate whenever activities begin to affect or collide with the liberties of others or of the public ,  Mr. Verrilli said , quoting Justice Robert Jackson from a 1944 case .Mr. Verrilli argued that the employees right to a legally guaranteed health benefit was left on the sidelines by the plaintiffs .Despite his best efforts , for a good part of the morning it was left on the sidelines by the Supreme Court justices as well ."
-1	"A CLOSE vote by a split electorate has handed President Obama a second term . He steps up , revived and renewed , to preside over a divided nation that often seems to agree on only one thing : todays children will live less well than their parents . This pervasive loss of confidence , though hard to precisely measure , is of enormous consequence . Its what sinks civilizations .Mr. Obama understands this , but hasnt fashioned a coherent response  and it nearly resulted in his defeat . The problem was starkly visible to 70 million viewers in that disastrous first debate when Mitt Romney showed many voters that he was confident about the future of the country . Mr. Obama seemed at a loss , conflicted and hesitant , as though hed been found out .To understand what was happening behind that lectern and the challenge Mr. Obama faces in his new term , its useful to consider what the president told me in a February 2011 interview in the Oval Office . Mr. Obama spoke of a presidents power to instill confidence in the people as something of a coin of the realm .Citing Franklin D. Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy , he talked about how both men , regardless of their policies , were masterly at helping Americans believe in themselves. Ronald Reagan , he said with a hint of envy , was very comfortable in playing the role of president ,  with his actors background .The president summed up what hed learned after an optimism-bruising two years in office : I think where the evolution has taken place ,  he said , is understanding that leadership in this office is not a matter of you being confident . Leadership in this office is a matter of helping the American people feel confident.Exuding confidence while not feeling it ? That straddle is particularly difficult for Mr. Obama , whos long wrestled with a dual role as appraising narrator , with those writerly skills , and main actor in the great play of events . Reconciling that split is what held him back in the campaign and left him tongue-tied when he tried to paint an alluring vision of the future . Obama the Narrator wouldnt let Obama the Actor sell a confidence he didnt feel , even if its what people were yearning for .Now , the re-elected president must find some way to tell us how he , and the country , can rightfully feel optimistic .To manage it , Mr. Obama will have to evolve . How ? Speak from the heart and then act . Its dangerous for anyone , even someone who published his autobiography at 33 , fashioning a personal narrative that helped propel him to the presidency , to be so fixated on the storytellers third-person view , which looks down from the ceiling . It slows ones step and adds a level of calculation  of how things will play  that undermines improvisations , the lightning reactions , the twists and surprises of a more dynamic leadership . Its the difference between writing about history and shaping it .Focusing on legacy , which is the endgame of the story , Mr. Obama has often missed whats happening before his eyes . The great mishap of the first term was failing to direct , as a new president with a sky-high approval rating , a sea of enthusiasts . After all , before the Tea Party arose , there was an army many times its size  Obamas Army  that he abandoned , leaving a tattered remnant that , in 2011 , supported Occupy Wall Street . By then , the Tea Party had been embraced by Republicans and become an electoral force ; still , Mr. Obama kept Occupy Wall Street at arms length .He now has won a new first 100 days . In hopes of harvesting a few lessons , its worthwhile to note what he did the first time , with all that political capital . Thinking of his legacy  the passage of health care reform  he missed opportunities presented by the twin crises of a collapsing economy and the banking meltdown to restructure the American financial system . He did not push for the creation of a sound and sustainable foundation for investing , in place of speculative trading . Then , by failing to use Obamas Army to drive the health care debate , he ceded ground to the Tea Party and had to limp across the finish line , a year later , with only a starting point for comprehensive health care reform  really , a widened coverage mandate by government .Maybe Mr. Obama will feel the valuable bite of those early , missed opportunities in the weeks to come , as he has to negotiate terms to avoid the looming fiscal cliff and the demands of Tea Party representatives . We have , indisputably , entered an age of wild participatory energies , bubbling up and driving a kind of relentless direct democracy . These voices will write the narrative for the coming days . And theyre looking for a lead actor .In our interview on that wintry day in 2011 , Mr. Obama said that the key thing a president should do is tell a story to the American people  something he said again to Charlie Rose this past summer . As someone whos been writing narratives for a few decades , I cant help but think of the standard told to generations of reporters : show , dont tell .Dont tell the story . Be the story , of a president who both rode and guided historys wave and fairly earned that coin of the realm : confidence ."
-1	"Alert ( or at least health-care-obsessed ) readers have no doubt been following the coverage of a new study on mortality in Massachusetts in the years following Romneycares coverage expansion , the gist of which  the authors found a striking , Massachusetts-specific decline in death rates for the non-elderly  tends to confirm liberal assumptions about the benefits of health insurance , and undercut the conservative and libertarian argument that insurance doesnt have the impact on health and mortality that most people expect . The studys findings are an almost-diametrical reversal of the results from Oregons Medicaid experiment , which were much discussed around this time last year ( heres my contribution ) , and which seemed to strengthen the conservative critique of Obamacares pursuit of comprehensive coverage . So now its liberalisms turn to claim vindication , and to press Obamacares critics to give ground in the debate .And some ground-giving is appropriate . Megan McArdle , among right-of-center writers , has probably written most extensively on the insurance-and-health question , so I think her response to the new study deserves to be quoted at length: heres my basic take : The study looks pretty good . It is hard to reconcile these results with Oregon . Good Bayesians will update their beliefs accordingly . I can think of reasons to believe Oregon rather than Massachusetts : Its a real [ randomized controlled trial ] , rather than a comparison of counties that are supposed to be similar but might not actually have been in practice . There are surprising results that might be red flags about the data : For instance , cancer mortality dropped , even though the study only ran four years . If the benefit is coming from early detection , I would expect it to take longer to have a significant impact on the data  Massachusetts also has differently sized samples  the control group has about 10 times the population of the treatment group . Since larger groups should tend to have less variance , this might increase the odds of getting a surprisingly good or surprisingly bad result with your treatment group .Most worrying is the period they compared : 2007 to 2010  The authors are not stupid ; they control for unemployment and poverty . But if the financial crisis affected Massachusetts differently from the rest of the country  and it did  then that may well show up in mortality in ways that are hard to measure .That said , I can also think of reasons to believe Massachusetts over Oregon . The treatment group sample is smaller than the control group by quite a lot , but its still huge by comparison with Oregon : 3,900,000 rather than around 6,000 . And Massachusetts is a single comprehensive system , unlike Medicaid , which people might drop in and out of as their income changes , dampening the effect of insurance . The authors find mortality thats amenable to treatment dropping more rapidly than overall mortality . And comparisons with nearby counties , and with the states elderly population , also deliver the same result .So what should we believe ? I havent changed my beliefs radically : I still basically think that health insurance improves mortality rates , but that that improvement is unlikely to be huge if you can get results like Oregon . However , after yesterdays report , Ive revised the probability of huge benefits upward , and you should do the same . And beware of those who are only willing to revise their beliefs in one direction .I completely agree , and I would only add the following point : To the extent that we should revise up the potential health benefits of insurance , we should revise down the extent to which the most rigorous conservative alternative to Obamacare  a reform that would shift the system toward flat , universal subsidies for catastrophic coverage  represents a kind of public policy free ( or at least relatively-inexpensive ) lunch . That is , if the preponderance of the evidence suggests that insurances health benefits are relatively limited , policymakers can hope to reap the cost-containing benefits of bigger co-pays and higher deductibles and health savings accounts without worrying too much that theyre creating gaping chasms between the care people need and the care they can afford and get . But if the Massachusetts study , rather than the Medicaid data or the famous RAND health insurance experiment , gets closer to the typical reality of what a health insurance expansion does , then policymakers are faced with a more explicit trade-off , in which whats saved through market forces by giving people more responsibility for their own health spending has to be balanced against whats lost in foregone care and treatment . And while having that trade-off suddenly look a lot starker than it has to date wouldnt settle the overall debate , it would give liberals a stronger case for their approach .As I noted in an earlier post , the mortality issue is one of several plausible metrics for assessing whether Obamacare succeeds or disappoints , and because of the variance in coverage expansions between red and blue states , presumably researchers will be able to push further on this question over the next five or ten years , and the evidence on one side or the other will look more dispositive . Right now , I would only offer a word of caution for liberals , who are ( understandably ) folding this study together with other positive data points ( falling uninsured numbers in Gallups polling , a brighter deficit picture , good news on some specific policy targets ) to make a case that the empirically-driven conservative critique of Obamacare is in the early stages of collapse .For all we know it might be , but the reality is that on most questions  mortality , deficits , cost containment , and coverage  we are by definition years away from remotely dispositive assessments . The Massachusetts research is only significant because the authors had years of post-Romney data to examine ; going forward , on just about every metric that matters for Obamacare , were looking at a similar timeframe for meaningful numbers and outcomes and results . So if either side , on any of these issues , is going to need to give substantial ground , the only intellectually-responsible way to do it will be  slowly ."
-1	"THE Obama administration has made a curious strategic choice in its defense of the constitutionality of the health care reform act . The central issue before the Supreme Court , which will begin hearing oral arguments on Monday , is whether the acts requirement that everyone buy health insurance  the so-called individual mandate  exceeds Congresss constitutional power .The acts other provisions regulating health insurance  like the requirement that health insurance companies take all applicants , regardless of pre-existing illnesses , and the prohibition against charging sicker patients higher rates  have not been challenged . And yet the administration is arguing that the individual mandate is not severable from these regulations ; if the mandate falls , they must as well , and health insurance companies would once again be free to choose whom to cover .But if the court were to strike down the individual mandate , it should stop there : that would be quite bold enough . The Supreme Court has long affirmed a presumption in favor of severability ,  meaning that when it rules that a statutory provision is unconstitutional , the decision should affect as little of the law as possible . As Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said , while speaking for the court in 2010 , making more extensive changes would constitute editorial freedom that belongs to the legislature , not the judiciary.It is Congress , not the court , that has the constitutional power and responsibility to make difficult legislative policy decisions like these . By arguing against severability , the Obama administration  and the laws opponents , who are making an even more radical claim  is urging the Supreme Court to abandon its tradition of judicial restraint , to ignore longstanding precedents and to undermine the separation of powers .Perhaps it comes as no surprise that the opponents of the law , which they call Obamacare ,  agree with the administration on this crucial point . They have even urged the Supreme Court to strike down the entire statute , including the acts many provisions that have nothing to do with health insurance coverage , like those relating to doctor training and the regulation of certain drugs . They would like nothing more than for the court to save Congress the trouble of having to muster the votes to try to repeal the law .To this end , the laws opponents have advanced several specious arguments . Because the act is so complex , they say , the court does not have the expertise to decide whether only one provision can be excised from it . In addition , because the statute was the product of hard-fought political compromise , every provision was necessary to secure a majority of votes , and the removal of any one would upset the delicate deal that was struck .But complexity is a key reason for the severability doctrine in the first place : it is Congress that has the expertise and responsibility to decide what should be kept absent the individual mandate . And virtually every statute reflects a bundle of political deals . If either of these arguments is accepted , it would destroy the doctrine of severability entirely .Both the Obama administration and the laws opponents have one argument in common . They express concern about what might happen to health insurance markets if the mandate is severed from the statute but the requirements that insurance companies cover sick patients and dont charge them higher rates remain . If healthy people do not have to buy insurance and insurance companies are forced to cover the sick , they warn , insurance would be far more expensive . No doubt rates would rise as a result . But the size of that increase  whether it would be 10 percent or 20 percent , as some claim  is unknown , and the Supreme Court is in no position to make that judgment on its own .Its not clear why the Obama administration has chosen this course . Perhaps it made a strategic choice to raise the stakes of striking down the mandate by asking the court to also invalidate the laws more popular provisions . Or it may be concerned that , if the mandate alone is struck down , there would not be enough votes in Congress to pass new provisions to compensate the insurance industry for its loss . But as a legal matter , the court should reject the argument .We believe that imposing the mandate was within Congresss powers to regulate commerce and that the legislation should be upheld . But if the Supreme Court strikes the mandate down , the rest of the law should stand , and Congress should have to decide what happens next .Why should an unelected court free the insurance industry from having to do its own political lobbying work in Congress ? Why should the court choose whether or not to deny injured and sick Americans health insurance ? These crucial decisions must be left to our elected officials , who  unlike the Supreme Court  can then be held accountable for them by the voting public ."
-1	"On Monday , I wrote that the apparent stabilization of Obamacare sharpens the political and policy challenge facing the laws critics . Instead of the sort of easy unraveling that some Republicans had convinced themselves was in the offing , I argued ( in a point made rather more forcefully by Ramesh Ponnuru ) that its now much more likely that the only way the things conservatives dislike about Obamacare will ever change or go away is if conservatives actually unite around reforms or a replacement that sustains some of the current laws coverage expansion ( albeit on significantly different terms ) .My sense is that some Republicans half-agree . That is , theyre willing to concede that the party needs an Obamacare replacement thats more serious than some of the G.O.P.s circa-2009 alternatives . But they also think the law will remain so unpopular , and that the number of losers will exceed the number of winners so dramatically , that conservative policymakers will have more room to maneuver , in terms of the initial coverage numbers a replacement might sustain , than my reading of the situation would suggest .The health care reform proposal rolled out by Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal this week offers a specific example of how this perspective cashes out . Unlike some other recent Republican proposals ( most notably , the bill co-sponsored in the Senate earlier this year ) , which promise tax cuts and savings relative to current policy , Jindals proposal explicitly starts with the 2008 baseline , and promises not to tax or spend a dollar more . His proposed reform would convert the open-ended deduction for employer-provided insurance into a flat deduction , extend the same deduction to people outside the employer market , and channel $ 100 billion over ten years to the states to provide for high-risk pools and other measures to help cover people with pre-existing conditions . What it conspicuously wouldnt do is create the kind of tax credit for catastrophic coverage that youll often find in right-of-center health care alternatives  because that would cost money relative to the 2008 baseline , and/or require further disruptions elsewhere in the system . Which means , in turn , that if you replaced Obamacare with Jindalcare in 2017 , youd see a coverage expansion relative to the Bush era , but a large number of the newly-insured would lose coverage without any immediate prospect of regaining it .Jindal was in D.C. yesterday to talk about his plan ( full disclosure , I was there ) , and the Washington Examiners Philip Klein has a good write-up of how he responded to , shall we say , pushback on this point:Jindal was pressed on why he chose to offer a tax deduction for individuals to purchase insurance rather than a refundable tax credit . Supporters of the tax credit approach argue that it would benefit more people , because lower-income Americans dont pay enough taxes for the deduction to be valuable enough to make insurance premiums affordable .He said that he decided on the deduction approach because relying on tax credits would be so costly that it would require tax increases  and Jindal doesnt want his plan to spend more or tax more than the system that existed prior to Obamacares passage . He also argued that credits would cause more disruption to the employer-based market and would be more prone to fraud .He said that whatever amounts of money conservatives were willing to allocate to address a problem , Democrats would always be willing to spend more , so conservatives can not get into a bidding war .Jindal cited previous estimates of similar reform proposals to his own , which he said could reduce family health insurance premiums by $ 5,000 annually and increase coverage by 9 million people relative to the number of people who were covered prior to Obamacare .I dont think conservative health care reform is about saying were going to compete with them in terms of how many people we say have an insurance card ,  he said . Thats not the ultimate goal.So obviously the governor and I have a substantive disagreement here : Like Jindal , Im deeply skeptical of the give everyone a Medicaid card approach to health care reform , but that skepticism pushes me toward supporting a basic catastrophic protection ( and other reforms ) instead , rather than toward just accepting , for the foreseeable future , a health insurance marketplace that prices a lot of working class Americans out of affordable coverage of any sort .But for the purposes of this post , Im more interested in the politics of the debate . Politically , I dont think theres any question that Jindals argument  go back to the pre-Obamacare baseline , expand coverage modestly relative to that  would play well with at least part of the G.O.P . electorate in a primary campaign . For a case , contra myself and Ponnuru , that it could also play pretty well in the general election and in a subsequent legislative battle , heres Ben Domenech , writing in yesterdays edition of his newsletter The Transom: when President Obama sold his health care law to the American people , he sold it to them primarily on the basis of cost . He did this because the polling was so unanimous : people werent demanding massive increased regulation of the insurance marketplace to achieve any particular moral goal about coverage levels or anything of the sort  the vast majority of Americans just cared that their premiums cost too much . So Obama made the case for his law based not on increasing coverage , but on decreasing costs  and along the way , he promised that no one would lose their doctor , their plan , or see worse coverage because of his law . In each case , his case was in line with the polling data on what the American people wanted .But what about making the case for health policy reforms in the post-Obamacare era ? For most center-right health policy experts and opinion-makers , the assumption has taken hold that coverage levels must be sustained or even increased under any comparable reform . They believe the argument in favor of universal coverage has been lost , and that any plan which kicks people off of an entitlement program is doomed to fail , politically .This is an assumption held by most people in Washington and the media . But I wonder how accurate it is . Post-Obamacare polling data on this question is lacking , but given the behavior of so many individuals and entities in reaction to Obamacare its possible that the bulk of Americans still hold the same views they did prior to the laws passage : that they want to retain their current plans , that they dislike disruption in their insurance experience , but that most of all , they want lower costs for themselves , not broader coverage for everybody else .I agree that support for universal coverage has tended to be soft , rising when it seems theoretical and then diminishing when the trade-offs actually present themselves . But my expectation is that with Obamacare in place , the psychology of loss aversion changes this calculus in two ways . First , indirectly  because it seems worse to most people to lose a benefit than to have never enjoyed it , voters will feel more morally uncomfortable supporting a candidate who promises to strip other peoples coverage than they would have felt voting for a candidate who opposed the expansion originally . And second , directly  because over the next few years , even voters who dislike Obamacare and arent getting subsidies are likely to internalize the idea that they now have an additional backstop in the event of job-loss or illness , and so voting to roll the program back completely and start afresh without that backstop will , again , be more unpopular than never creating it in the first place would have been . ( The consistent presence , in most polls , of an anti-Obamacare demographic that prefer changes to outright repeal suggests to me that the idea of maintaining some kind of quasi-universal guarantee has relatively strong appeal . )Id also make a broader point : Yes , the health care law remains unpopular , but it was unpopular in 2012 as well , and the economy was worse , and the Republican nominee still went down to defeat  not least , I would submit , because of the perception that he couldnt be trusted to safeguards the interests of the non-rich . So even if people generally care more about cost than coverage , it still seems quite likely that this fatal impression of the partys priorities would be accentuated , rather than diminished , in a 2016 campaign where the Republican nominee would be quite directly promising to drive the uninsured rate up .My expectation could be confounded , I concede , if the next few years are a true disaster of spiking premiums and stagnant newly-insured numbers . And I would certainly agree with Domenech that the structure of the law is a lot more vulnerable than exuberant liberals seem to think this week .But I also think that in political terms , its actually slightly crazy for Republicans to bet this way given the other options available to them . The Jindal theory , that the right shouldnt bother competing with liberals on certain policy fronts because theyll always be outbid , is generally problematic ( why does his proposal have any coverage expansion , then ? ) but its a particularly odd idea to embrace in a case where the liberal program may not , as even its defenders allow , actually end up delivering the scale of coverage expansion that was expected .By which I mean that if the current enrollment trends persist , there is a good chance that some version of a more catastrophic-focused reform could actually enroll somewhat more Americans in some kind of basic coverage than Obamacare , at a substantially lower cost . ( A preliminary private score of the Senate Republican bill suggested it could get slightly higher coverage numbers , and that was  I believe  using the C.B.O . projections for Obamacare , which may turn out to have been too high . ) Which in turn would offer Republicans an opportunity to effectively outbid the Democrats on enrollment while significantly underbidding them on spending . ( The Democrats could , of course , counter with single-payer  but the G.O.P . should want to provoke that debate ! ) And to pass up that unusual opportunity in favor of a probably-doomed fidelity to a nearly decade-old baseline  well , I suppose it would be very much like the Republican Party Ive come to know and love so well ."
-1	"TODAY marks the beginning of health care coverage under the Affordable Care Acts new insurance exchanges , for which two million Americans have signed up . Now that the individual mandate is officially here , let me begin with an admission : Obamacare is awful .That is the dirty little secret many liberals have avoided saying out loud for fear of aiding the presidents enemies , at a time when the ideal of universal health care needed all the support it could get . Unfortunately , this meant that instead of blaming companies like Novartis , which charges leukemia patients $ 90,000 annually for the drug Gleevec , or health insurance chief executives like Stephen Hemsley of UnitedHealth Group , who made nearly $ 102 million in 2009 , for the sky-high price of American health care , the presidents Democratic supporters bought into the myth that it was all those people going to get free colonoscopies and chemotherapy for the fun of it .I believe Obamacares rocky start  clueless planning , a lousy website , insurance companies raising rates , and the presidents telling people they could keep their coverage when , in fact , not all could  is a result of one fatal flaw : The Affordable Care Act is a pro-insurance-industry plan implemented by a president who knew in his heart that a single-payer , Medicare-for-all model was the true way to go . When right-wing critics expose the fact that President Obama endorsed a single-payer system before 2004 , theyre actually telling the truth .What we now call Obamacare was conceived at the Heritage Foundation , a conservative think tank , and birthed in Massachusetts by Mitt Romney , then the governor . The president took Romneycare , a program designed to keep the private insurance industry intact , and just improved some of its provisions . In effect , the president was simply trying to put lipstick on the dog in the carrier on top of Mitt Romneys car . And we knew it .By 2017 , we will be funneling over $ 100 billion annually to private insurance companies . You can be sure theyll use some of that to try to privatize Medicare .For many people , the affordable part of the Affordable Care Act risks being a cruel joke . The cheapest plan available to a 60-year-old couple making $ 65,000 a year in Hartford , Conn. , will cost $ 11,800 in annual premiums . And their deductible will be $ 12,600 . If both become seriously ill , they might have to pay almost $ 25,000 in a single year . ( Pre-Obamacare , they could have bought insurance that was cheaper but much worse , potentially with unlimited out-of-pocket costs . )And yet  I would be remiss if I didnt say this  Obamacare is a godsend . My friend Donna Smith , who was forced to move into her daughters spare room at age 52 because health problems bankrupted her and her husband , Larry , now has cancer again . As she undergoes treatment , at least she wont be in terror of losing coverage and becoming uninsurable . Under Obamacare , her premium has been cut in half , to $ 456 per month .Lets not take a victory lap yet , but build on what there is to get what we deserve : universal quality health care .Those who live in red states need the benefit of Medicaid expansion . It may have seemed like smart politics in the short term for Republican governors to grab the opportunity offered by the Supreme Court rulings that made Medicaid expansion optional for states , but it was long-term stupid : If those 20 states hold out , they will eventually lose an estimated total of $ 20 billion in federal funds per year  money that would be going to hospitals and treatment .In blue states , lets lobby for a public option on the insurance exchange  a health plan run by the state government , rather than a private insurer . In Massachusetts , State Senator James B. Eldridge is trying to pass a law that would set one up . Some counties in California are also trying it . Montana came up with another creative solution . Gov . Brian Schweitzer , a Democrat who just completed two terms , set up several health clinics to treat state workers , with no co-pays and no deductibles . The doctors there are salaried employees of the state of Montana ; their only goal is their patients health . ( If this sounds too much like big government to you , you might like to know that Google , Cisco and Pepsi do exactly the same . )All eyes are on Vermonts plan for a single-payer system , starting in 2017 . If it flies , it will change everything , with many states sure to follow suit by setting up their own versions . Thats why corporate money will soon flood into Vermont to crush it . The legislators wholl go to the mat for this will need all the support they can get : If you live east of the Mississippi , look up the bus schedule to Montpelier .So lets get started . Obamacare cant be fixed by its namesake . Its up to us to make it happen ."
-1	"WashingtonIF Mitt Romneys pivots on Presidents Obamas health care reform act have accelerated to a blur  from repealing on Day 1 , to preserving this or that piece , to punting the decision to the states  it is for an odd reason buried beneath two and a half years of Republican political condemnations : the architecture of the Affordable Care Act is based on conservative , not liberal , ideas about individual responsibility and the power of market forces .This fundamental ideological paradox , drowned out by partisan shouting since before the plans passage in 2010 , explains why Obamacare has only lukewarm support from many liberals , who wanted a real , not imagined , government takeover of health care. It explains why Republicans have been unable since its passage to come up with anything better . And it explains why the law is nearly identical in design to the legislation Mr. Romney passed in Massachusetts while governor .The core drivers of the health care act are market principles formulated by conservative economists , designed to correct structural flaws in our health insurance system  principles originally embraced by Republicans as a market alternative to the Clinton plan in the early 1990s . The presidents program extends the current health care system  mostly employer-based coverage , administered by commercial health insurers , with care delivered by fee-for-service doctors and hospitals  by removing the biggest obstacles to that systems functioning like a competitive marketplace .Chief among these obstacles are market limitations imposed by the problematic nature of health insurance , which requires that younger , healthier people subsidize older , sicker ones . Because such participation is often expensive and always voluntary , millions have simply opted out , a risky bet emboldened by the 24/7 presence of the heavily subsidized emergency room down the street . The health care law forcibly repatriates these gamblers , along with those who can not afford to participate in a market that ultimately cross-subsidizes their medical misfortunes anyway , when they get sick and show up in that E.R . And it outlaws discrimination against those who want to participate but can not because of their medical histories . Put aside the considerable legislative detritus of the act , and its aim is clear : to rationalize a dysfunctional health insurance marketplace .This explains why the health insurance industry has been quietly supporting the plan all along . It levels the playing field and expands the potential market by tens of millions of new customers .The rationalization and extension of the current market is financed by the other linchpin of the law : the mandate that we all carry health insurance , an idea forged not by liberal social engineers at the Brookings Institution but by conservative economists at the Heritage Foundation . The individual mandate recognizes that millions of Americans who could buy health insurance choose not to , because it requires trading away todays wants for tomorrows needs . The mandate is about personal responsibility  a hallmark of conservative thought .IN the partisan war sparked by the 2008 election , Republicans conveniently forgot that this was something many of them had supported for years . The only thing wrong with the mandate ? Mr. Obama also thought it was a good idea .The same goes for health insurance exchanges , another idea formulated by conservatives and supported by Republican governors and legislators across the country for years . An exchange is as pro-market a mechanism as they come : free up buyers and sellers , standardize the products , add pricing transparency , and watch what happens . Market Economics 101 .In the shouting match over the health care law , most have somehow missed another of its obvious virtues : it enshrines accountability  yes , another conservative idea . Under todays system , most health insurers ( and providers ) are accountable to the wrong people , often for the wrong reasons , with the needs of patients coming last . With the transparency , mobility and choice of the exchanges , businesses and individuals can decide for themselves which insurers ( and , embedded in their networks , which providers ) deserve their dollars . They can see , thanks to the often derided benefits standardization of the reform act , what they are actually buying . They can shop around . And businesses are free to decide that they are better off opting out , paying into funds that subsidize individuals coverage and letting their employees do their own shopping , with what is , in essence , their own compensation , relocated to the exchanges .Back when the idea of letting businesses and consumers pick their own plans  with their own money on an exchange  first floated around Washington , advocates called them association health plans. They , too , would have corrected for the lack of transparency , mobility and choice in local insurance markets by allowing the purchase of health insurance across state lines . They were the cornerstone of what would have been the Bush administrations reform plan ( had the administration not been distracted by other matters ) . After the rejection of Hillarycare in the mid-90s , association health plans emerged as the centerpiece of pro-market , Republican thinking about health reform  essentially what would become Romneycare , extended via federal law to cover the entire country . So much for Mr. Romneys argument that his plan in Massachusetts was an expression of states rights . His own party had bigger plans for the rest of the country , and they looked a lot like Obamacare ."
-1	"ANTON CHEKHOV once remarked that one must not put a loaded rifle on the stage if no one is thinking of firing it. In the term that ended last week , the Supreme Court reached a liberal outcome in cases involving President Obamas health care law , Arizonas draconian immigration statute and mandatory life sentences for juveniles . But the conservative majority also laid down a cache of weapons that future courts can use to attack many of the legislative achievements of the New Deal and the Great Society  including labor , environmental , civil rights and consumer protection laws  and to prevent new progressive legislation . Far from being a source of jubilation , the term may come back to haunt liberals .The immediate result of Thursdays 5-to-4 health care ruling was a victory for the Obama administration and the millions of Americans who will get improved access to medical care . But four justices would have struck down every provision of the 900-plus-page act , and Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. , who provided the fifth vote to uphold the mandate that individuals buy insurance or pay a penalty , distanced himself from the law . It is not our job ,  he wrote , to protect the people from the consequences of their political choices. The chief justice , who at 57 is likely to sit on the court for at least another two decades , made clear that governments ability to address many of the nations most pressing problems is subject to some new limitations .We take for granted that the federal government can forbid landlords to reject a tenant based on his race or religion ; prohibit development on fragile wetlands ; finance the Medicare program for the elderly ; require public schools to give girls an equal opportunity to play sports ; collect revenue to pay for the National Institutes of Health and the national parks ; encourage energy conservation by taxing gas guzzlers ; prohibit discriminatory voter ID laws ; and vindicate the right of state government employees to take unpaid leave to care for sick relatives .The conservative legal movement has already attacked many of these provisions , and the Roberts court has been steadily supplying it with ammunition to do so . Conservative judicial rhetoric  for example , Justice Antonin Scalias denunciation last week of the Obama administrations decision not to deport young , law-abiding illegal immigrants who came to this country as children  may be designed to change the political climate as well .The federal governments ability to regulate economic and social life stems largely from four powers in the Constitution . Under the commerce clause , Congress can regulate national economic activity . Under the taxing power , it can lay and collect Taxes. Under the spending power , it can provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States. And under the enforcement powers , it can enact appropriate legislation to enforce the 14th Amendments equal protection and due process clauses and the 15th Amendments guarantee of the right to vote regardless of race .From the 1930s through the Warren and Burger courts , the Supreme Court largely deferred to the political branches judgments about the scope of these powers ; it was their partner , not their adversary . The court recognized  as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg pointed out in her opinion on the health care case  that the political process was the primary vehicle for limiting governments powers .Under the last chief justice , William H. Rehnquist , the court began to turn , particularly on Congresss commerce and enforcement powers . The court limited some statutes  notably , a section of the Americans With Disabilities Act that allowed state workers to sue their employers and a section of the Violence Against Women Act that gave victims of gender-motivated violence the right to sue in federal court  but upheld others , including other applications of the disabilities law , a provision of the Family and Medical Leave Act , and a statute criminalizing possession of homegrown marijuana ."
-1	"In my post yesterday on potential metrics for assessing Obamacares claim to be a policy success , I didnt directly address the laws eventual impact on the deficit . So Im grateful to Jonathan Chait for raising the issue , in the course of a post explaining why the Obamacare debate proves ( yet again , he would say ) that liberals are more empirical and data-driven than conservatives . Noting that many Republicans had alleged that the laws promise of deficit reduction was based ( in Paul Ryans words ) on gimmicks and smoke and mirrors ,  Chait cites a new C.B.O . estimate on the cost of the laws coverage expansion and announces that reality has spoken , and the case is closed:There will never be a single dramatic moment that will shatter the rights inbred health-care falsehoods the way the election , in a single night , discredited the poll-unskewers . But the Congressional Budget Offices update on Obamacare issued last week is the latest and most powerful repudiation of the case Ryan and his allies made . It reiterates that , contrary to the rights certainty that the apparent deficit-reducing measures would melt away as the program went online , it still reduces the deficit . Indeed , it turns out to be even more fiscally conservative than originally forecast . Every new forecast turns out to be more optimistic than the last .In fact , this is not exactly what the update says : Its focused exclusively on the cost of the coverage expansion , which means that it doesnt address the offsets ( sharp cuts to Medicare , in particular ) that Republicans had in mind when they accused the White House of relying on promises of future belt-tightening that will never actually be imposed . The update does reference a two-year-old projection which found that these offsets , if duly enacted , would reduce the deficit , but then it pleads agnosticism as to the current situation , writing that CBO  can no longer determine exactly how the provisions of the ACA that are not related to the expansion of health insurance coverage have affected their projections of direct spending and revenues  isolating the incremental effects of those provisions on previously existing programs and revenues four years after enactment of the ACA is not possible.So the report doesnt tell us anything , and doesnt claim to tell us anything , about whether all the promised Medicare cuts are actually happening ( spoiler : they arent ) , let alone whether they or any other revenue-raising provisions ( the Cadillac tax on high-value plans , the employer mandate ) are likely to be fully implemented in the future , or whether already-implemented and unpopular measures like the medical device tax could end up being repealed , or  well , you get the idea . Which means that by definition , the update isnt proof that the law is even more fiscally conservative than originally forecast ,  because that simply isnt a question it sets out to answer .This doesnt mean , though , that we cant make an educated guess about the fiscal picture , and mine is that whats happened to date is mostly a wash : The projected cost of coverage has gone down , as Chait says , mostly because health care inflation has been well below expectations and because Obamacare is covering fewer people than originally hoped , and the Obama White House has used those savings as a reason to postpone some unpleasant-to-implement provisions  delaying Medicare Advantage cuts , weakening IPABs mandate , delaying the employer mandate , etc .This interconnectedness of coverage , cost inflation and deficits is part why I didnt include the deficit in my prior list of standards for success  because its entangled , in different ways , with the standards I did list . If enrollment ends up well below expectations , for instance , the fiscal cost of the program will be much more manageable  but its not clear , given the laws coverage-expanding objectives , that this would actually count as true good news . Alternatively , if cost inflation stays low , then the fiscal issues will likewise diminish in a way thats much more uncomplicatedly positive . But then in a scenario where inflation picks up again and enrollment heads back toward the levels that the laws architects expected , the problem of actually cutting Medicare will loom larger , and the promised-but-postponed offsets will have to actually be pursued . At which point well actually find out if the G.O.P . was right to dismiss them all as smoke and mirrors  but until then , the question is still open .The deeper debate here , though , is one that cant necessarily be decisively adjudicated by even the most data-driven umpire , for reasons suggested by the C.B.O.s point about the difficulty of isolating the effect of Obamacare on existing policies and programs . Here I mean that its entirely possible that the new health care law will end up being technically revenue neutral while also having a sweepingly negative impact on Americas fiscal picture overall  because its mix of cuts and tax hikes , if fully enacted , could drastically limit future policymakers options when the time comes to make further cuts or raise taxes to pay for Medicare and Social Security . ( This is part of what conservatives mean when they accuse the Obama White House of double counting and gimmickry and the like  theyre saying that if you make cuts to an insolvent-in-the-long-run program to pay for a new program , youre engaged in something other than fiscal conservatism ,  because you havent actually addressed your original insolvency problem . )Again , maybe  hopefully  a permanent slowdown in health care costs makes a lot of this problem go away . But its quite possible that well end up , 10 or 15 years from now , with liberals declaring that Obamacare has been deficit-neutral and conservatives declaring that its created big fiscal problems , and with both sides having a reasonable ( and , yes , empirical ) point ."
-1	"PROVIDENCE , R.I.  M is a 33-year old woman who swallowed silverware . She wasnt psychotic , or out of touch with reality . She knew it was not a good idea to swallow forks and knives and she wasnt trying to kill herself . In fact , each time she ingested utensils , she went to the emergency room so that doctors could remove them from her esophagus and stomach . Then the hospital transferred M to the psychiatric unit , where she was assigned to my care .When I met M she had already been hospitalized 72 times . Shed swallowed silverware  and batteries  before . Sometimes she inserted sharp objects or large doses of medication into her vagina . There are psychiatric patients who cut or burn themselves in an attempt to relieve mental anguish ; M did both of these things , too , periodically , but she had primarily developed a maladaptive habit of ingesting or inserting dangerous objects into her body as a means of coping with stress . Each time , she said , she felt better afterward . Then she brought herself to the emergency room for treatment .Ms case is dramatic . But she is one of countless psychiatric patients who have nowhere to turn for care , other than the E.R . It is well known that millions of uninsured Americans , who cant afford regular medical care , use the countrys emergency rooms for primary health care . The costs  to patients health , to their wallets , and to the health care system  are well documented . Less visible is the grievous effect this shift is having on psychiatric care and on the mentally ill .Our failure to provide adequate psychiatric care to patients before they are in crisis affects us all . The lack of continuing outpatient care between hospitalizations leaves many psychiatric patients ill and often unmedicated . The consequences are felt in our communities , where the undertreated mentally ill are vulnerable to drug use , criminal recidivism ( with additional court and incarceration costs ) , victimization and suicide .The costs of Ms repeated hospitalizations are staggering . Her ingestions and insertions incur the already high costs of hospital admission and the medical procedures and surgeries she requires . In addition , once M is hospitalized as a psychiatric patient , a staff member must stay with her at all times to make sure she doesnt ingest utensils from her meal trays , insert tools from group craft activities into her body or drink Purell from the dispensers on the unit walls .How could this cycle of self-injury be disrupted ? M and other psychiatric patients who turn to emergency rooms for care need regular outpatient appointments with a doctor they know and trust who can monitor their symptoms and assess the efficacy of their often complicated medication regimens . Sadly , Ms history of recurrent hospital admissions is not uncommon . When people are admitted to the psychiatric hospital where I practice , their charts indicate how many times they have previously been hospitalized . Not infrequently , these numbers are more than twice the patients age . Recently I treated a 65-year-old man caught in a chronic cycle of homelessness and suicide attempts who had been in and out of the E.R . 246 times .If M had insurance , or enough money to pay out of pocket , she might see a therapist every week for an hour and a psychiatrist once or twice a month . Instead , shes treated by an overextended , publicly funded mental-health center where she sees a psychiatrist for 20 minutes , four times a year . Not surprisingly , her symptoms persist and she is hospitalized again and again .In one of the ironies in a country with health care discrepancies , a single hospital admission for M  paid for by the taxpayer-financed state medical-assistance program  costs more than a year of private outpatient care would .Our failure to provide a critical , basic level of outpatient psychiatric care to the mentally ill creates a volatile cycle in which uninsured or underinsured patients avail themselves of treatment only when they are in crisis . This is analogous to refusing to to treat hypertensive patients  or to monitor their blood pressure  unless they show up in the E.R . after having had a stroke .The number of psychiatric patients seeking care in emergency rooms is rising . New research by the California HealthCare Foundation reveals that about half of the states adults and two-thirds of the adolescents with mental health needs arent receiving treatment . According to the Utah State Division of Substance Abuse and Mental Health , 69 percent of Utahs residents who need public mental health care do not receive any . In Rhode Island , where I practice , the National Alliance on Mental Illness reported a 65 percent increase in the number of mentally ill children living in public hospital emergency rooms following a series of state budget cuts . The increasing number of psychiatric patients relegated to emergency care creates a backlog in our E.R.s , delaying or preventing medically ill patients from receiving necessary evaluation and treatment .With budget constraints and a shortage of psychiatric hospital beds , patients must be deemed a danger to themselves or others to qualify for inpatient admission . In order to guarantee that they will be evaluated in the emergency room and then admitted for further psychiatric treatment , patients must convincingly communicate their dangerousness or distress .In her last three E.R . visits , M has done just that . She registers at the intake desk , and then goes into the bathroom , where she swallows dangerous objects , or packets of pills . If M had a regular outpatient psychiatrist , she could call him or her in these moments of distress , schedule an urgent appointment , and obtain treatment and care from a simple phone call . But M does not have a relationship with a provider ; she has a relationship with an institution . And the institution requires that M be in imminent danger in order to be treated .We know that regular psychiatric care works . According to Dr. E. Fuller Torrey , president of the national nonprofit Treatment Advocacy Center , Assisted outpatient treatment has proven to reduce psychiatric hospitalizations by more than 70 percent.The Affordable Care Act may improve access to psychiatric care for the mentally ill . The act will extend health care to 32 million Americans , and the National Association of Psychiatric Health Systems reports that this specifically includes mental health and substance abuse parity benefits.But , in order to fulfill that promise , we will need to place new societal value on the importance of mental health . Until accessible , affordable mental-health care is a universal right , too many psychiatric patients will continue to receive the reactionary , crisis-driven care that is all our emergency rooms are equipped to provide ."
-1	"OF all the ways to limit health care costs , perhaps none is as popular as cutting payments to doctors . In recent years payment cuts have resulted in a sharp downturn in revenue for many hospitals and private practices . What this has meant for most physicians is that in order to maintain their income , theyve had to see more patients . When you reduce the volume of air per breath , the only way to maintain ventilation is to breathe faster .As our workdays have gotten busier , we doctors have had less time to devote to individual patients . An internist I know in private practice used to see 15 patients a day . Now reimbursement is so low I have to see at least 30 ,  he told me . If I stay in the room more than 10 minutes , my assistant will call me and tell me to hurry up.Racing through patient encounters , we practice with an ever-present fear that we will miss something , hurt someone and open ourselves up to legal ( not to mention moral ) liability . To cope with the anxiety , we start to call in experts for problems that perhaps we could handle ourselves if we had more time to think through a case . The specialists , in turn , order more tests , scans and the like .And therein lies the sad irony of the health cost containment paradigm in this country . There is no more wasteful entity in medicine than a rushed doctor .The Institute of Medicine , a federally funded research group in Washington , has estimated that wasteful health care spending  i.e. , spending that does not improve health outcomes  costs about $ 750 billion in the United States every year . Excessive paperwork and administrative costs explain some of this waste , but unnecessary or inefficiently delivered services , especially in hospitals , account for by far the largest chunk . Total payments to physicians , in comparison , are much smaller , making up a fifth or less of the money this country spends on health care .But even though physicians salaries account for a relatively small fraction of health care costs , physicians decisions may affect upward of 80 percent of total health spending . We order tests , prescribe drugs , hospitalize patients and  one of the costliest decisions a doctor can make today  call specialists for help .There are many downsides besides cost to having too many doctors on a case . Specialists recommendations are often contradictory . The kidney doctor advises careful hydration ; the cardiologist advises discontinuing intravenous fluid . Because specialists arent paid to confer with each other or to coordinate care  although the Affordable Care Act is putting payment systems into place that will do just this  they often leave primary physicians without clear direction on what to do .More important , patients dont always require specialists . Patients , especially older adults , often have disease syndromes that can not be compartmentalized into individual problems and are probably best managed by a good general physician . When specialists are called in , each is apt to view a problem through the lens of his specific expertise . Patients generally end up worse off . I have seen it over and over .One of my patients went to the emergency room after swallowing a tiny fish bone . She told me about the experience when she came to see me . They kept me down in that E.R . for two days !  she said . They did X-rays , EKGs , CAT scans , God knows what . They had an ear , nose and throat specialist come by . They called a pulmonologist . They told me to follow up with my cardiologist . I told them it had nothing to do with it . It was the fish ! What is the solution to this predicament ? One option is to hire doctors as employees and put them on a salary , as they do at the Mayo and Cleveland Clinics , which takes away some of the financial impetus to cram more and more patients into a workday .Another option is to use bundled payments , which are calculated on the basis of the expected costs of a particular treatment ( for example , an entire hospitalization ) rather than discrete for every service . A major driver of health care overutilization is that doctors are paid piecemeal . There is little financial incentive to call in specialists if payments are bundled .Reforms will also have to focus more on education . Through an initiative of the American Board of Internal Medicine called Choosing Wisely , medical-specialty societies recently released lists of tests and procedures that are not beneficial to patients , including M.R.I.s for most lower back pain and stress tests when there are no signs of heart disease . These criteria are essential for educating physicians and patients alike about wasteful medical services that they should avoid . If patients were more involved in medical decision-making , there would be more constraints on doctors behavior , thus decreasing the possibility of these tests and consultations .Health care costs must be contained , but cutting payments to doctors is a self-defeating strategy . Policy makers need to focus on the drivers of waste . And one of the most potent is when doctors reflexively call other doctors for help ."
-1	"NOT long ago , a 23-year-old woman joined my company as an assistant in the advertising sales department at a starting salary of $ 35,000 . Smart , ambitious and poised , she should have a promising future . Unfortunately , her earnings prospects are threatened . Like many Americans , shes unaware of how much of her compensation is being eaten up by health care costs , and how much this share will grow as long as the increase in health costs exceeds growth in gross domestic product . Thats just math .The Affordable Care Act does require employers , beginning this year , to note on W-2s how much both the employee and the employer contributed to health care costs . Maybe that will help diminish the ignorance regarding true health care costs . But even with greater awareness , many Americans still might not understand that the largest effect of the cost of our health care system is to reduce the amount of money they actually take home .I have estimated that our 23-year-old employee will bear at least $ 1.8 million in health care costs over her lifetime . Thats assuming that such costs dont grow by more than current government estimates , that she never has a working spouse , and that she and her dependents dont ever contract a serious illness .Even after decades of financial engineering , including both the already-implemented and the planned aspects of the Affordable Care Act , the American health care system can be called successful mainly in its ability to hide its enormous cost .My new employee thinks that she is paying roughly $ 2,600 for health care in her first year on the job  her $ 500 deductible plus her $ 2,100 share of the companys health insurance premiums . In fact , shes paying more than $ 10,000 into the countrys health care system . As her employer , our company will pay $ 6,190 of her health care costs , money that might otherwise go to her in salary . ( From my point of view as a chief executive of a company , health care is just a different form of compensation . ) She is also paying more than $ 1,500 in federal and state taxes to finance Medicare and Medicaid .Clearly , personal health insurance is not the only way our employees pay into our health care system . There is the 1.45 percent of every paycheck that goes to Medicare , as well as the portion matched by the employer . Furthermore , a large slice of her general taxes are , in fact , health care costs : roughly 20 percent of federal spending and 10 percent of state spending support Medicare and Medicaid . She must pay for all of this .And of course , when my 23-year-old employee turns 65 , shell be eligible for Medicare and will begin to pay Medicare premiums of , say , $ 140 a month in todays dollars . She is likely to do so for the rest of her life .For employees like her , however , the greatest impact of exploding health care costs will arrive in the form of stagnating wages . Before the Affordable Care Act became law , President Obamas Council of Economic Advisers warned that its projections to 2040 showed that essentially all of the rise in average compensation due to increasing productivity over time would go to health insurance , and essentially none would go to take-home wages.This year , a standard deductible family policy for our company will carry premiums of roughly $ 23,000 . How has health care gotten so expensive that even a middle-income worker faces such a burden ?In the world of health care analysis , there are basically two schools of thought . The first is that health care is so fundamentally different from other goods and services that a normal market cant drive down its prices . This school of thought makes a number of assumptions : health care consumers are desperate and have no leverage to avoid high pricing . An individuals need for care depends on luck and genes , so that social fairness requires pooling risk .An aging population needs ever more care . New technologies offer beneficial advances but only at great expense . For-profit motivations conflict with fundamental human needs , requiring extensive regulatory oversight . Managing the insurance system requires costly and complex administration ( with direct annual administrative costs now running at roughly $ 1,900 per household ) ."
-1	"WASHINGTON  THE great irony of Barack Obamas political rise is that it depended on what turned out to be his single biggest political miscalculation . From the moment he appeared on a national stage  in his 2004 there is not a liberal America and a conservative America speech  he held himself out as the leader who could transcend the partisan divide and win over Republicans .His policy plans did not set him apart from the other Democrats running . Even on the Iraq war , which he had opposed from the start , he and other Democrats mostly agreed by 2007 . Mr. Obama won the nomination largely because of what he called hope and change and Hillary Clinton mocked as a vision of the skies opening up to reveal celestial choirs singing .All of that seems very long ago , doesnt it ?Mr. Obama trounced the Republicans last week with a Hillaryesque strategy of holding firm and winning an argument , not by finding common ground . He , his advisers and Congressional Democrats decided from the start that trading changes to the health care law for the reopening of the government and the lifting of the debt ceiling would merely encourage Republicans to create future showdowns .When the face-off ended and the government reopened Thursday , Mr. Obama kept up the pressure . You dont like a particular policy or a particular president ?  he asked . Then argue for your position . Go out there and win an election.In those words was a hint of a new strategy that suddenly seems less far-fetched  more available to the White House  than it did when large parts of the government closed on Oct. 1 .Yes , Mr. Obamas immediate task will involve returning to the negotiating table , to talk about a budget deal . But he has spent much of the past five years overestimating his ability to find common ground on such issues . The White House has come to believe that many Republicans are interested only in victory , not in compromise-laden deals that , say , trade Medicare cuts for new taxes on the affluent or trade a more secure border for a path to citizenship .And Mr. Obama now seems more willing to play the victory game . He can make the case ( supported by polling ) that his positions on several major issues  including immigration and taxes  enjoy more public support than Republican positions . If there are still no deals to be had , Mr. Obama and his fellow Democrats can concentrate , albeit quietly , on highlighting their differences with Republicans and taking their case to the voters in next years midterm election .Thanks to the vagaries of Congressional districts , Democrats would have to win the aggregate popular vote in House races by about 6.8 percentage points or more to win back a majority , estimates Dave Wasserman of the Cook Political Report . Such a large margin would be unprecedented in modern politics for the party that controls the White House , and Mr. Obamas mediocre approval ratings wont make it easier .Yet the Republican Partys current standing also has few precedents . Recent polls have put its approval rating between 20 and 25 percent , at or near recorded lows . After the shutdown , the Cook Political Report changed its rating on 15 House races  14 in the Democrats direction  and said Republicans were approaching the danger zone.Recapturing the House may be the one event that could fundamentally alter the presidents second term , a term that so far has accomplished little beyond protecting his first terms projects . Mr. Obama would then have to negotiate largely with Republicans in the Senate , where some deals seem available . The Senate has already passed a bipartisan immigration overhaul .There are clearly risks to a difference-highlighting strategy for Mr. Obama . He won a second term , and the shutdown debate , partly because voters judged him as willing to compromise . Some liberals may imagine that if only Democratic politicians were more passionate and pure , the rest of the country would come along . But the country is not as liberal as liberals wish it were .A second irony of Mr. Obamas career is that he has proved better at the messy business of helping hold together his own partys Congressional caucus than President Bill Clinton did , despite their popular images . For all the talk of Mr. Obamas distaste for schmoozing , he was the one who finally passed a sweeping health care law . To do so , he and Congressional leaders had to hold together every single Senate Democrat , from Bernie Sanders on the left to Ben Nelson on the right .The Democratic solidarity continued through the shutdown , with almost no meaningful defections . But because the Democrats no longer control the House  and todays House Republicans are so passionately conservative  the solidarity is not enough to pass bills .Publicly , the White House is likely to emphasize negotiation for now . This was not a trivial event here ,  David Axelrod , the Obama confidant , told me , referring to the shutdown . The outcome is a powerful tool here in promoting the potential for a compromise. Mr. Obamas view of this has been hardened by five years of experience , but I dont think he will close his mind to the possibility of a compromise ,  he added .Perhaps the most intriguing question facing the Democrats is whether they will abandon their insistence on higher taxes for the affluent in exchange for cuts to Medicare and Social Security . With the deficit falling , Democrats could change their focus from tax increases to spending increases on their biggest priorities . They could push for Mr. Obamas Preschool for All proposal , along with a partial reversal of the recent sequestration cuts and more money for climate research , college financial aid and highways .If the deal did not seem good enough  or if Mr. Obama decided that tax increases had to be part of any budget deal  Democrats could then turn their attention to the public debate and the midterms .Throughout his career , Mr. Obama has shown an openness to conservative ideas ( like cutting Social Security and overhauling public schools ) that sometimes vexes his allies . But he has also come to believe that much of the modern Republican Party is broken , reliant on an aging minority of voters and hobbled by leaders who can not reliably deliver their rank and file even when the leaders want to deal .The man who once dismissed talk of red and blue America now sees the divide as a central aspect of American life . He has begun to act accordingly . For the moment , the strategy is working ."
-1	"WASHINGTON  THE United States government is likely to shut down nonessential services tomorrow , after House Republicans voted before dawn yesterday to attach a one-year delay of President Obamas health care law ( and a repeal of a tax to pay for it ) to legislation to keep the government running . The Democratic-led Senate is expected to refuse .House Republicans also said last week that they would not agree to lift the debt ceiling unless implementation of the health law was delayed by one year . So the government is also headed toward a mid-October default on its debts  and a full-blown constitutional crisis .Failure to raise the debt will force the president to break a law  the only question is which one .The Constitution requires the president to spend what Congress has instructed him to spend , to raise only those taxes Congress has authorized him to impose and to borrow no more than Congress authorizes .If President Obama spends what the law orders him to spend and collects the taxes Congress has authorized him to collect , then he must borrow more than Congress has authorized him to borrow . If the debt ceiling is not raised , he will have to violate one of these constitutional imperatives . Which should he choose ?In 2011 , when Congress last flirted with not raising the debt ceiling , lawyers disagreed . Some argued that the president must honor the debt ceiling , thereby violating budget laws . Others held that he must honor budget legislation . No one argued that he should unilaterally raise taxes . Professors Neil H. Buchanan and Michael C. Dorf , who parsed the arguments in the Columbia Law Review in 2012 , concluded that all options were bad , but that disregarding the debt ceiling was least bad from a legal standpoint .I agree . Lawyers tend to play down policy considerations as a basis for interpreting law . In this case , the consequences are so overwhelmingly on one side that they can not be ignored by the president and should not be ignored by the courts . If the debt ceiling is not increased , the president should disregard it , and honor spending and tax legislation .A decision to cut spending enough to avoid borrowing would instantaneously slash outlays by approximately $ 600 billion a year . Cutting payments to veterans , Social Security benefits and interest on the national debt by half would just about do the job . But such cuts would not only illegally betray promises to veterans , the elderly and disabled and bondholders ; they would destroy the credit standing of the United States and boost borrowing costs on the nations $ 12 trillion publicly held debt .There is no clear legal basis for deciding what programs to cut . Defense contractors , or Medicare payments to doctors ? Education grants , or the F.B.I. ? Endless litigation would follow . No matter how the cuts might be distributed , they would , if sustained for more than a very brief period , kill the economic recovery and cause unemployment to return quickly to double digits .Nor is it reasonable to expect the president to collect more in taxes than is authorized by law . For him to do so would infringe on Congresss most fundamental powers and the principles on which the nation was founded .The only defensible option for the president if the debt ceiling is not raised is to disregard the debt ceiling . The action would be unconstitutional because it would be illegal . Financial markets might react negatively , but not nearly so negatively as if the United States failed to redeem bonds or to pay interest on its debt .The president would be attacked . He might even be impeached by the House . But maybe not : the House would then be saying that the president should have illegally failed to pay F.B.I . agents , or school districts , or Medicare doctors . In any case , he would not be convicted by the Senate . And he would have saved the nation from much agony .Disregarding the debt ceiling would have one additional , thoroughly benign effect . It would end the capacity of Congressional minorities to precipitate crises in order to accomplish goals for which they lacked the votes . Today , a minority is holding hostage all federal programs in an attempt to eviscerate a law that Congress passed , the president signed and the Supreme Court upheld  the Affordable Care Act . In the future , an imaginative and irresponsible minority could use the threat not to raise the debt ceiling for any purpose  to shape tax policy , or foreign policy , or civil rights policy .The debt ceiling is the fiscal equivalent of the human appendix  a law with no discoverable purpose . It is one law too many . Once Congress has set tax rates and spending levels , it has effectively said what it wants the debt to be . If Congress leaves the debt ceiling at a level inconsistent with duly enacted spending and tax laws , the president has no choice but to ignore it ."
-1	"The true ideological inclinations of the Obama White House can be endlessly debated , but slightly more than halfway through this presidency I think its fair to make the following generalization : Obama has governed as a business-friendly social democrat and an aggressive social liberal , as a hawkish interventionist when intervention seems cheap and easy ( drones , missiles , etc . ) and a cautious realist when it doesnt , and as a surprisingly vigorous defender of presidential prerogatives across a variety of fronts . A few weeks ago , I characterized Obama-era liberalism as featuring an imperial presidency , a corporatist economic policy , and then a libertarian turn on almost every social issue ,  and while that line misses various nuances and complexities , as one-sentence summaries go I think its pretty good .Its also useful for understanding why the last few weeks have been so rough for this White House . Obviously theyve been difficult because scandal has piled on scandal : The resurfacing Benghazi affair , the news that the Internal Revenue Service took a disproportionate election-year interest in conservative activists , and now the revelation that the Department of Justice secretly seized two months worth of phone records for Associated Press reporters as part of a highly aggressive leak investigation . But its also because the details of the scandals raise uncomfortable questions about the particular policy synthesis that Obama has pursued  and theyre getting traction at a time when other high-profile stories , from the debate over the Oregon Medicaid study in wonkland to the trial of the late-term abortionist Kermit Gosnell over in culture-war territory , are raising similarly uncomfortably questions on other fronts .In the case of Benghazi , as Tim Carney points out , you have a story thats ultimately about an administration trying to downplay the resilience of Al Qaeda and the messiness of post-intervention Libya , lest those realities sow election-year doubts about the success of the White Houses entire light-footprint , drones-and-bombs approach to counterterrorism and the Middle East . In the case of the I.R.S . and Justice Department imbroglios , you have two stories that dont need to have direct links to the Oval Office to remind people of the kind of abuses that that imperial presidencies tend to generate . ( Its also striking that both the new Benghazi revelations and the I.R.S./DoJ scandals came hard hard on the heels of Rand Pauls filibuster , which was arguably the first moment when the Obama administration faced a significant political challenge on questions of executive overreach . )Meanwhile , whatever spin you put on the Oregon Medicaid study , it was a real-world test of the administrations signature domestic policy initiative whose results clearly didnt live up to liberal expectations , and its given skeptics of Obamacare perhaps their most statistically potent ammunition at a moment when the new health care law is about to face the test of implementation . ( Which , of course , involves new responsibilities for  the I.R.S . ) Likewise , while the implications of the Gosnell case are open for debate , its the first occasion in a while when social liberals have clearly been forced on the defensive  and the first high-profile story in Obamas entire presidency to throw his own radicalism on abortion into sharp relief .Obviously his White House faced major challenges all across its contentious first term . But it was rare for the administration to see its attempt at a new left-of-center synthesis challenged and undercut across multiple fronts at once  on foreign policy and civil liberties and domestic policy and social issues . Journalists no doubt talk too much about narratives and storylines , but they do matter , and having all of these stories in the wind at once is significant , in part , because it threatens to rewrite the publics understanding of what Obama-ism represents . The president wants to be seen , and works to be seen , as a pragmatic , data-driven steward of popular programs whos leading a wave of social progress at home while keeping us as safe from terrorists as any Republican tough guy could . But the current mix of headlines suggests a very different take on the same record  in which Obama embodies a new progressivism thats too comfortable with executive power and too eager to conduct foreign policy from 30,000 feet , too cozy with powerful interest groups and too wedded to a dysfunctional welfare state , and as far outside the mainstream on social issues as any of the right-wingers it likes to define itself against .Whether this alternative narrative actually takes hold with the public and press remains to be seen . But the last few weeks have clearly made it more credible , and an easier sell to the unconvinced , than all the slings and arrows of 2012 campaign ."
-1	"WashingtonTHE obvious victor in the Supreme Courts health care decision was President Obama , who risked vast amounts of political capital to pass the Affordable Care Act . A somewhat more subtle victor , but equally important , was the rule of law more generally : in an era when so many people on the left and right view the justices , and constitutional questions , through the prism of politics , the court today made clear that law matters and that it isnt just politics by other means .But there was a subtle loser too , and that is the federal government . By opening new avenues for the courts to rewrite the law , the federal government may have won the battle but lost the war .Indeed , it is becoming so commonplace for the federal courts to invalidate legislation that a decision like the health care one is celebrated resoundingly  even when the court has invalidated part of a law Congress passed . In just one day , the Supreme Court struck down as unconstitutional just as many laws of Congress as it did during the first 70 years of its existence : two .Obviously , health care has captured the minds of Americans  but moments before the court announced that decision , which upheld the overall law but invalidated a requirement that states expand Medicaid coverage in exchange for federal financing , it struck down another law , the Stolen Valor Act , which made it a federal misdemeanor to lie about having received a military decoration .The health care decision also contains the seeds for a potential restructuring of federal-state relations . For example , until now , it had been understood that when the federal government gave money to a state in exchange for the states doing something , the federal government was free to do so as long as a reasonable relationship existed between the federal funds and the act the federal government wanted the state to perform .In potentially ominous language , the decision says , for the first time , that such a threat is coercive and that the states can not be penalized for not expanding their Medicaid coverage after receiving funds . And it does so in the context of Medicaid , which Congress created and can alter , amend or abolish at any time . The states knew the terms of the deal when they joined  and those terms continue to be enshrined in the federal code .This was the first significant loss for the federal governments spending power in decades . The fancy footwork that the court employed to view the act as coercive could come back in later cases to haunt the federal government . Many programs are built on the governments spending power , and the existence of an extraconstitutional limit on that power is a worrisome development .The government told the court that longstanding laws , like the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 , contain clauses that condition money on state performance of certain activities . The decision leaves open the question of whether those acts , and many others ( like the Clean Air Act ) , are now unconstitutional as well .Even more worrisome for the federal government is the way the court reached the result it did on Medicaid . The court had to rewrite the statute to save it from a constitutional problem by eliminating the part of the law that permitted the federal government to withdraw Medicaid financing . The result , as Justice Anthony M. Kennedy warned , was effectively to leave in place a statute that Congress never enacted . ( That is the same move that Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. employed in 2009 when he led the court to uphold the constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act . )But there is a danger here too : that courts are given the power to rewrite legislation altogether , and leave legislation in place ( like health care ) in a form that Congress might never have approved and that would be difficult to ever repeal .Of equal concern is the courts analysis of the constitutionality of the individual mandate . While the court upheld the mandate , it did so by rejecting the federal governments claim that it was regulating commerce . There is no judicial precedent or language in the Constitution that compelled that result ; instead , the majority reasoned by constitutional inference .The court employed language that could be read to suggest that whenever statutes are novel , they are unconstitutional . This atextual reading of the Constitution , odd for strict constructionists ,  may later blossom into a radical constitutional theory that could upend decades , if not centuries , of precedent , going all the way back to Chief Justice John Marshalls famous opinion in the 1819 case McCulloch v. Maryland , which spoke of a flexible , adaptable Constitution .Time will tell whether todays decision foreshadows things to come . But one thing is apparent : Americans are growing increasingly comfortable , if not always happy , with the idea of nine men and women in Washington handing down rulings that remove decisions from the legislative process or even rewrite legislation altogether .While Chief Justice Roberts wrote an opinion that was apolitical and deserves much praise for its statesmanship , he did so within a legal context that is becoming less and less democratic . That context is obviously not of his making , but it makes imperative a serious conversation about judicial restraint ."
-1	"THE stunner yesterday was that Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. , joined by the Supreme Courts four most liberal justices , wrote the majority opinion that upheld the individual mandate in President Obamas signature Affordable Care Act , which requires Americans to obtain health insurance or pay a penalty . In an ironic twist , the chief justice simultaneously accepted the conservative argument that Congresss power to regulate interstate commerce did not include the power to regulate economic inactivity , like a decision not to purchase health care . The court ruled 5 to 4 on that point , with the chief justice joined by the courts four other conservative justices .But what Chief Justice Roberts took from Congress with one hand , he gave it with the other : a broad reading of the taxing power . In the majority opinion , he wrote that since paying a penalty for not obtaining insurance could be seen as a tax , and since the Constitution permits such a tax , it is not our role to forbid it , or to pass upon its wisdom or fairness. He will no doubt attract praise in some quarters for splitting this baby .But his decision is wrong . As a matter of constitutional text , legal history and logic , the power to regulate commerce and the power to tax should not be separated . It is not good for the court or the country that the chief justices position in such an important case is confused at its core .Consider first the constitutional text . Chief Justice Roberts refers to Congresss power to lay and collect Taxes. But its worth recalling the surrounding language , which notes that Congress has the power to lay and collect Taxes only in order to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States.Historically speaking , this clause corrected one of the great weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation ( the precursor to the Constitution ) , which had forced Congress to essentially beg the states for the revenues needed to run its business . By giving Congress independent powers over taxation and other revenue sources , the Constitution ended that dependency . But as a quid pro quo , the Constitution also restricted the use of these revenues to classical public goods  benefits that must be given to all citizens , if given to any  like paying off national debts and paying for the nations defense . General welfare , mentioned in parallel with these two phrases , is best read as covering only matters that advance the welfare of the United States as a whole . The redistribution of income , or transfer payments among citizens , like those mandated under the Affordable Care Act , doesnt qualify for taxation in this originalist reading of the Constitution .Through the early 20th century , the Supreme Court was cognizant of this tight relationship between the power to regulate an activity directly and to the power to tax it . The basic idea relies on a simple economic insight : taxation and regulation are close substitutes , so a limitation on one power matters little if the other power is still available . There is no practical difference between ordering an action , and taxing or fining people who dont do that same thing . If the Constitution limits direct federal powers , it must also limit Congresss indirect power of taxation .In his opinion , Chief Justice Roberts didnt come to grips with the two critical early Supreme Court cases that set out the relationship between the powers of regulation and taxation  a relationship that survived the New Deal revolution in understanding the Commerce Clause . In the Child Labor Tax case of 1922 , the Supreme Court refused to uphold a tax equal to 10 percent of the net profits of any firm that shipped goods into interstate commerce if the firm used child labor anywhere in its plants . Chief Justice William Howard Taft noted that the courts earlier decision in Hammer v. Dagenhart ( 1918 ) forbade Congress to use its commerce power to prohibit outright the shipment of ordinary goods across state lines because they were made in factories that used child labor . A heavy tax , the court argued , could not be used to mount an end run around this constitutional obstacle to its own power .The same point was reinforced in 1936 in United States v. Butler , which struck down a tax on agricultural commodities because it sought to achieve the then unconstitutional regulatory aim of reducing the total acreage in agricultural production . After the 1942 case Wickard v. Filburn , when the Commerce Clause was held to permit such regulation , the tax became just as permissible as direct regulation . Wickard expanded the scope of federal power , but it did nothing to upset the constitutional parity between the taxing and commerce powers .Chief Justice Roberts has ignored this fundamental principle : If direct regulation is beyond the scope of the Commerce Clause ( as he held ) , then taxation as an indirect route to the same regulation should be off limits as well ( as he failed to hold ) . This is a baby that should not be split . His attempt to do so undermines his ruling , the court and the Constitution ."
-1	"PRESIDENT OBAMA has endured much criticism of his legislative skills from his fellow progressives . His conciliatory approach has been compared unfavorably with Franklin D. Roosevelts gleeful pugnacity and Lyndon B. Johnsons relentless arm-twisting . His willingness to strike deals with corporations has been tagged business as usual. Many progressives , frustrated over the past three years , have concluded that the political system is fundamentally broken because corporate power has been allowed to suffocate popular liberal policies .But the Supreme Courts upholding of Mr. Obamas health care law reminds us that the presidents approach has achieved significant results . If his liberal critics paused to assess how he achieved such results , they would not see a system paralyzed by corporations ; they would see that the most liberal reforms in more than 40 years have been brought about because Mr. Obama views corporate power as a force to bargain with , not an enemy to vanquish .The necessity of corporate support for , or at least acquiescence to , liberal policies is not a new development in the history of American liberalism . Indeed it has been one of its hallmarks .Roosevelt may be remembered for his combativeness toward corporations ; he famously said , I welcome their hatred. But he said that in 1936 , only after key New Deal legislation had passed with the help of the United States Chamber of Commerce and the American Bankers Association .Early on , Roosevelt was quite adept at bargaining with corporations . In his first 100 days , to attract corporate support for the National Industrial Recovery Act , he won collective bargaining , minimum wages and maximum hours in exchange for a temporary suspension of antitrust law , so businesses could fix prices . To establish the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1934 , he made concessions to Wall Street that scrapped statutory requirements in favor of regulatory flexibility . The following year , to allow the Federal Reserve to better conduct monetary policy , he gave bankers representation on the policy committee .Johnson also found little value in warring with corporations . He won a Keynesian tax cut in early 1964 , defeating budget-conscious conservatives , thanks to a broad coalition that included corporations . He attracted business support to back his first antipoverty bill by junking plans to promote family farming and push businesses to hire long-term unemployed people . He created the Transportation Department , in 1966 , only after exempting resistant shipping interests from its jurisdiction . He incited a new era of environmental protection , increasing federal responsibility for cleaning air and water , while defusing corporate opposition by trading away federal pollution standards .Democratic presidents typically pay dearly when they choose to fight corporations instead of deal with them . Jimmy Carter sapped his political capital in the first two years of his presidency by trying to pass , with belligerent anticorporate rhetoric , a National Energy Act that would reduce our dependence on oil . He gave two major national addresses intended to rally the public and fend off critics attacks . At a town hall , he lashed out at oil companies for enjoying a position of privilege in our country for too long and having undue influence in Congress . But these confrontational tactics failed to rouse enough public ire to trump that influence , and Mr. Carter settled for a far smaller energy bill than he originally demanded .Or consider President Bill Clinton . In 1993 , his health care task force largely resisted meeting with insurance lobbyists as it drafted legislation . In turn , the insurers didnt wait for the legislation to be finalized before embarking on a vicious advertising campaign . When the first lady , Hillary Rodham Clinton , tried to belittle that effort , fund-raising for the insurance lobby skyrocketed and its advertising budget quintupled . Mr. Clinton , his bully pulpit diminished , couldnt get Congress to vote on his bill . He suffered such a humiliating defeat that his ability to enact any other progressive reform was severely crippled ."
-1	"IF the government shutdown has shown us anything , its that the 80 or so House Republicans driving the crisis have emerged as the most unified force in politics : tightly organized , highly disciplined and ideologically firm .But wasnt their plan to make the budget a vehicle for defunding President Obamas health care legislation doomed from the start ? And even if this small band has the backing of voters in their safely drawn red districts , as well as Tea Party support , havent their unyielding tactics antagonized a majority of the public ?In fact , this minority faction  the suicide caucus ,  as the conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer has called it  may be less shortsighted and self-defeating than it appears . At a time when so many officials in both parties still invoke the virtues of compromise and perpetuate the ideal of common ground on which conservative pragmatists can meet moderate Democrats ,  these more combative Republicans may be in the vanguard of a new post-consensus politics .Consider the warnings of many , including some in the conservative establishment , that the shutdown will rebound against the party . As evidence they cite the shutdown of 1995 . The winner then was President Bill Clinton , who deftly used the episode to right his wobbly presidency and then coasted to a second term in 1996 .But Ted Cruz , the Texas senator who helped set the stage for the conflict , has offered a different interpretation . Those prophesying ruin need to go back and read their history books a little more closely regarding 1995 , he said on Laura Ingrahams radio show in July . In the next election , 1996 , Republicans held on to the majority in the House , the first time Republicans had done that since 1930 , in 66 years ,  Mr. Cruz pointed out . We lost a total of nine seats in the House . In the Senate , we gained two seats.Mr. Cruz , in other words , was calculating the odds of success in terms of the Congressional , rather than presidential , outcome . This makes sense , since he was born in 1970 and came of age in the years when his party struggled to build national majorities ( winning the popular vote only once in the six presidential elections held from 1992 to 2012 ) and instead flexed its muscles through the legislature .Changing demographics would seem to weaken the appeal of anti-government figures like Mr. Cruz ( who was born in Canada and is of Cuban ancestry ) . That is why traditional conservatives like the columnist Michael Gerson insist that pragmatic Republicans are the partys salvation , and that Mr. Cruz and his allies are mounting a revolt against reality.But as America becomes more diverse , another population has come more clearly into view : the alienated and disenchanted . These people have embraced a libertarian and anti-government outlook and have little use for what they see as the compromised , impure big government conservatism of the Reagan and Bush years .To this constituency , the Republican who will go as far as he can  taking one last crack at undoing Mr. Obamas health care reform or voting later this month not to raise the debt ceiling  is not an obstructionist but a politician of principle , a rebel with a cause .The business of the opposition is to oppose ,  as Robert A. Taft , the Republican senator who led the attempt to slow down New Deal programs , once said .Recent victories that Republicans have won , for instance on gun control , have come not through compromise but by out-organizing and outspending their opponents . The hallowed idea of consensus , and the dream of building a majority , has given way to a survival strategy .The most striking example of Republican opposition is the revival of the doctrine of states rights , historically associated with slavery and Jim Crow . There are unmistakable overtones of this past in the anti-Obamacare movement in some of the 26 states , especially in the Deep South , that have rejected the Medicaid expansion ."
-1	"MITT ROMNEY , moderate . That earnestly sought post-debate public image contrasts starkly with Mr. Romneys actual positions on many issues , especially the future trajectory of government spending .Clinging tightly to a studied vagueness when pressed for unpopular specifics , Mr. Romney has put forward a budget framework that would not eviscerate Medicare and Social Security , as is commonly believed , but would slash everything else thats not defense .President Obama should use Tuesday nights debate to press Mr. Romney to defend  or even just explain  these proposed cuts , which would be far more draconian than those advanced by his running mate , Paul D. Ryan . Mr. Ryan is widely viewed as the real fiscal hawk , but in key areas , his views on spending levels are actually closer to Mr. Obamas than to Mr. Romneys .All in all , Mr. Ryan and Mr. Romney do see the future similarly  over the next decade , they want government spending reduced to about 20 percent of the United States gross domestic product , below the historic average of around 21 percent . ( Recognizing that an aging society costs more , Mr. Obama proposes to hold spending at its current level , 23 percent . )These differences may not sound like much , but by 2023 , each percentage point of G.D.P . could represent about $ 250 billion in federal spending .Though Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. brought it up repeatedly in his debate with Mr. Ryan on Thursday , Social Security  the single biggest government expenditure  is not on the battlefield . Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan have each backed away from threats to privatize or cut it and now propose to spend the same amount on it as Mr. Obama would in the coming decade .Thats not the case with Medicare . Mr. Obama and Mr. Ryan have each endorsed similar packages of about $ 950 billion of savings over 10 years , while Mr. Romney has opposed any reduction , making it virtually impossible for him to achieve his overall spending limit .To be sure , Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan agree  and differ with Mr. Obama  on many matters , like how to contain the growth in Medicare spending and whether to raise the eligibility age .And they part company from Mr. Obama when it comes to the Affordable Care Act ( the Republicans demand its repeal , claiming it would save about $ 1.6 trillion ) and Medicaid ( Messrs. Romney and Ryan want it turned over to the states and want to cut nearly 20 percent from Mr. Obamas planned levels ) .But with respect to nearly half the budget , Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan widely diverge from each other .Mr. Romney is calling for a huge increase in defense spending  roughly $ 2 trillion more over the next decade than Mr. Ryan wants to spend , which is only $ 400 billion above Mr. Obamas budget  even though the military is not asking for such an increase . Such an increase would force giant reductions , about 40 percent , in everything thats left .Everything else isnt some catchall of small items , like feeding Big Bird . Were talking about a vast array of programs including civilian and military pensions , food stamps , unemployment and disability compensation , the earned income and child tax credits , family support and nutrition , K-12 education , transportation , public safety and disaster relief . And on and on .All told , Mr. Romney would allocate $ 6.9 trillion for these items , compared with the $ 9.3 trillion proposed by his own running mate ( and Mr. Obamas $ 12 trillion , which itself represents a 9 percent reduction from current levels , after adjusting for inflation ) .No doubt some of what is buried within other mandatory and nondefense discretionary spending can be eliminated . Perhaps Americans wont miss a few national parks or the space program .But also nestled within this category are critical outlays for investments in infrastructure and research .Eating the seed corn is never advisable , yet thats what Washington is already doing . The share of spending on infrastructure ( roads , airports , dams and the like ) fell from 2 percent of G.D.P . in 1971 to 1 percent in 2010 .More  not less  government money needs to be invested in these kinds of growth-generating projects ( not to mention education and training ) .I recognize that in the real world , cuts on the scale envisioned by Mr. Romney will prove politically untenable , which would force a President Romney to rethink his agenda .But as a statement of intent , its Mr. Romney  not Mr. Ryan  who has produced the budget that would more dramatically reduce the services offered by government , and in ways that would shock and outrage most Americans . We can only hope that Mr. Obama will draw those contrasts clearly in the debate ."
-1	"PRINCETON , N.J.  THE Republicans in the House of Representatives who declare that they may refuse to raise the debt limit threaten to do more than plunge the government into default . They are proposing a blatant violation of the 14th Amendment , which states that the validity of the public debt of the United States , authorized by law is sacrosanct and shall not be questioned.Yet the Obama administration has repeatedly suppressed any talk of invoking the Constitution in this emergency . Last Thursday Jay Carney , the White House press secretary , said , We do not believe that the 14th Amendment provides that authority to the president to end the crisis . Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew reiterated the point on Sunday and added that the president would have no option to prevent a default on his own .In defense of the administrations position , the legal scholar Laurence H. Tribe , who taught President Obama at Harvard Law School , has insisted , as he put it two years ago , that only political courage and compromise can avert disaster .These assertions , however , have no basis in the history of the 14th Amendment ; indeed , they distort that history , and in doing so shackle the president . In fact , that record clearly shows that Congress intended the amendment to prevent precisely the abuses that the current House Republicans blithely condone .Congress passed the 14th Amendment and sent it to the states for ratification in June 1866 . Its section on the public debt began as an effort to ensure that the government would not be liable for debts accrued by the defeated Confederacy , but also to ensure that its own debt would be honored .That was important because conservative Northern Democrats , many of whom had sympathized with the Confederacy , were in a position to obstruct or deny repayment on the full value of the public debt by paying creditors in depreciated paper money , or greenbacks. This effective repudiation of obligations already accrued  to , among others , hundreds of thousands of Union pensioners and widows , as well as investors  would destroy confidence in the government and endanger the economy .As the wording of the amendment evolved during the Congressional debate , the principle of the debts inviolability became a general proposition , applicable not just to the Civil War debt but to all future accrued debts of the United States . The Republican Senate leader , Benjamin F. Wade of Ohio , declared that by placing the debt under the guardianship of the Constitution ,  investors would be spared from being subject to the varying majorities which may arise in Congress.Two years later , on the verge of the amendments ratification , its champions inside the Republican Party made their intentions absolutely clear , proclaiming in their 1868 party platform that national honor requires the payment of the public indebtedness in the utmost good faith to all creditors at home and abroad ,  and pronouncing any repudiation of the debt a national crime.More than three generations later , in 1935 , Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes , ruling in the case of Perry v. the United States , revisited the amendment and affirmed the fundamental principle that Congress may not alter or destroy debts already incurred .House Republicans threatening to refuse to raise the debt ceiling  that is , force a repudiation of debts already accrued  would violate that fundamental principle of the Constitution .Surely the lawyers advising and defending the White House , let alone the president , know as much . Refraining from stating this loudly and clearly , and allowing Congress to slip off the hook , has been a puzzling and self-defeating strategy , leading to the crippling sequester and the politics of chronic debt-ceiling crisis . More important , by failing to clarify the constitutional principles involved , the administration has neglected to do its utmost to defend the Constitution ."
-1	"WASHINGTON  It is the morning of Wednesday , Nov. 7 , and after a long night of celebrating and a short night of sleep , Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan wake up to confront the question awaiting every new administration : Of the campaigns many promises , which few will become the real priorities ?If they win the White House , Republicans are also more likely than not to hold on to the House of Representatives and win a narrow majority in the Senate . The party could then embark on the kind of aggressive legislative push that President Obama and the Democrats did in 2009 .Only four years after Democrats seemed on the verge of historic policy gains , Republicans could reverse many of those gains and then some . They could cut the top tax rate to its lowest level in 80 years ( as Mr. Romney proposes ) and make major changes to federal programs .Above all , a sweep of Washington could make possible the sort of change Republicans have been talking about for three decades without having yet done : a significant shrinking of government . Ronald Reagan cut domestic programs somewhat but expanded the military , while George W. Bush talked about small government but actually made it bigger . Next year , though , really could be different .Even if Mr. Romney is not the obvious vehicle for the Tea Party revolution , his campaign and his selection of Mr. Ryan for vice president suggest he is game . His choice of Ryan ,  says Grover Norquist , the anti-tax activist , answers any questions about whether he is for dramatically reducing the cost of government. Congressional Republicans may force the issue anyway , arguing that their victories demand wholesale change .Were having a real debate about the size and scope of government ,  says Senator John Cornyn of Texas , who is overseeing the Republicans Senate campaigns . If Governor Romney and Congressman Ryan win , as I expect they will , they can justly claim a mandate , and I think it will make it much easier to do the hard things we all know need to be done.Already , Republicans are starting to think ahead , as is only natural . A Romney transition team , known as The Readiness Project ,  has begun meeting . In 2008 , similarly , Obama aides began discussing whether health care or climate policy should be the top priority , a hugely consequential decision .For a Romney administration , one of the first questions will be how much to use a legislative process known as reconciliation . Under reconciliation , filibusters are prohibited and only a simple majority of 51 Senate votes , rather than 60 , is needed . With Democrats likely to oppose the Romney agenda overwhelmingly and a couple of Republican moderates potentially having qualms , reconciliation would likely play a big role in 2013 .To the extent that we can get Democrats to buy into it , great ,  Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio , a conservative House leader , told me . But we need to go there and do what we told the voters we were going to do. Mr. Cornyn said , There are a whole lot of very important things you can do with 51 votes.Norman J. Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute describes the plan as the mother of all reconciliation bills.Congress would first pass a temporary delay of the fiscal cliff  the tax increases and spending cuts set to take effect , for a variety of reasons , on Jan. 1 . Mr. Romney might need to sign such a bill retroactively , assuming victorious Republicans and a lame-duck Mr. Obama did not reach a compromise in late 2012 .Republicans could then turn to long-term priorities . On taxes , the crucial decision will be whether to pursue a tax-code overhaul , with lower rates and fewer tax breaks . Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan have each proposed an overhaul , but they have not specified which tax breaks they would reduce to keep their rate cuts from adding to the deficit . And the large tax breaks , like those for health insurance and mortgage interest , are popular .If a full overhaul is going to happen , the mostly likely approach may be a ceiling on how many overall tax breaks someone could claim , avoiding a series of lobbying fights over each break . Martin S. Feldstein , a longtime Republican economist , has proposed such a plan . One of Mr. Ryans budget plans contains a related idea , in which people can opt into a simpler tax code .But given how hard tax reform is under any circumstance , the fallback may be a simple tax cut , making the Bush tax cuts permanent and taking some rates lower . Republicans would have to endure criticism that they were violating Mr. Romneys campaign pledges , by reducing the affluents relative tax burden and adding to the deficit . They could counter that future economic growth would solve the problems , even if independent analysts disagreed .Mr. Norquist and many conservatives say they could support a simple tax cut . Byron Dorgan , the former Democratic senator from North Dakota , says of the Republicans , They value tax cuts more than virtually anything , including the deficit , and I think theyve demonstrated that.On health care , the initial focus may not be Medicare , despite the campaign attention it has received . ( Mr. Romney has promised not to touch current benefits , which suggests that he may first pursue modest changes , like pilot programs reducing the governments role . ) A Romney administration may instead focus on two less politically perilous areas : Mr. Obamas health law and Medicaid , which covers many poor people and much long-term care for the elderly .Although Republicans could not repeal all of Mr. Obamas health law with reconciliation , they could undo most of the insurance expansion , because it relies on government subsidies for the uninsured . Congress could also shrink Medicaid , which covers about one in six Americans . You turn the money over to states ,  says Douglas Holtz-Eakin , president of the American Action Forum , a conservative research group , and you promise less money. Mr. Ryans budget envisions 75 percent less Medicaid spending than now projected .Beyond health care , Mr. Romney and Congressional Republicans have called for large cuts in federal programs . They have not specified those cuts , but because they would exempt the military , most other areas would likely take significant reductions .What would the combined effects of the new Republican revolution be ? Some government agencies would probably become less wasteful , learning to do more with less , and the private sector would take over some government functions . But those would not be the only changes . The American economy would also devote fewer of its resources to the areas that do not naturally create opportunities for profit in a free market : mass transportation , road building , early-stage scientific research , many aspects of education and public safety .Whether you love that idea or hate it , it certainly would be different . Around the world , the historical pattern has been for government to grow as a society becomes richer and citizens vote for more of the services that the market often does not provide by itself . Federal spending makes up 22 percent of the American economy today , up from 3 percent a century ago .In an aging society coping with a globalized economy , where health care and education continue to grow more ambitious and expensive , the country has a choice to make . It can allow government to continue expanding . Or , as a Romney administration would , it can take a more laissez-faire path than any wealthy country has previously tried ."
-1	"TUSCALOOSA , Ala.  THE United States Constitution speaks of the Supreme Courts jurisdiction over cases and controversies. But when social controversies do come before the court , its powers are limited . In Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores , which concerned the dispute over the Affordable Care Acts contraceptive mandate , the court may have decided the case . The larger controversy , however , wont be settled so easily .By a 5-to-4 vote , the court on Monday held that the mandate , which requires employers to provide health insurance coverage for contraception , could not be applied to closely held for-profit corporations with religious objections to some forms of contraception . Religious groups described the mandate as part of a war on religious freedom . Supporters of the mandate countered that a victory for the plaintiffs would allow large corporations , under the cover of religious freedom , not just to impede womens exercise of their reproductive rights but also to defy civil rights statutes with impunity .Amid this heated talk , it was easy to lose sight of the fact that this was a statutory case , not a case decided under the First Amendments protection of freedom of religion . The statute in question , the Religious Freedom Restoration Act , states that the government shall not substantially burden the exercise of religion without satisfying a demanding legal test .It is worth noting that the act was championed by President Bill Clinton and passed in 1993 , with near unanimity , by a Democrat-controlled Congress . The act was drafted in response to a controversial 1990 Supreme Court decision that made it easier  far too easy , according to critics of all political stripes  for the government to burden the exercise of religion .The decision in Hobby Lobby was no shock to anyone familiar with the heavy weight that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act places on religious accommodation . The fate of the case was sealed 21 years ago  not by a slim majority of the court , but by virtually every member of Congress . In a dissenting opinion on Monday , Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg argued that the courts ruling in Hobby Lobby was one of startling breadth ,  but the statute itself is deliberately broad .So why all the shouting ? If the Religious Freedom Restoration Act is clearly written , and the product of a democratic process , what explains the apocalyptic rhetoric surrounding this case ? In truth , the sources of the controversy lie outside the issue of the contraceptive mandate itself . And that should be great cause for concern  to both sides of the debate .The first source of controversy is the collapse of a national consensus on a key element of religious liberty : accommodation . Throughout American history , there has been widespread agreement that in our religiously diverse and widely devout country , it is good for the government to accommodate religious exercise . We have disagreed about particular accommodations ( may a Muslim police officer wear a beard , despite police department policy ? ) , and especially about whether religious accommodations should be ordered by judges or crafted by legislators . But we have generally agreed that our nation benefits when we help rather than burden those with religious obligations . That consensus seems , quite suddenly , to have evaporated .A second source of controversy is that many people view the Hobby Lobby case as concerning not just reproductive rights but also , indirectly , rights for gays and lesbians . Advocates for same-sex marriage have long insisted that their own marriages need not threaten anyone elses , but citizens with religious objections to same-sex marriage wonder whether that is entirely true : Will a small-business owner be sued , for instance , for declining to provide services to a same-sex couple ? Conversely , and understandably , gay and lesbian couples wonder why they do not deserve the same protections from discrimination granted to racial and other minorities . For both sides , Hobby Lobby was merely a prelude to this dawning conflict .The third source of controversy is a change in our views of the marketplace itself . The marketplace was once seen as place to put aside our culture wars and engage in the great American tradition of buying and selling . The shopping mall has even been called the American agora. But today the market itself has become a site of cultural conflict . Hobby Lobby is one of many companies that seek to express faith commitments at work as well as at home and that dont see the workplace as a thing apart from religion . Many companies preach and practice values , religious and otherwise , that are unrelated to market considerations . CVS , for example , recently announced that it would stop selling tobacco products , regardless of how that decision might affect its bottom line .A country that can not even agree on the idea of religious accommodation , let alone on what terms , is unlikely to agree on what to do next . A country in which many states can not manage to pass basic anti-discrimination laws covering sexual orientation is one whose culture wars may be beyond the point of compromise . And a nation whose marketplace itself is viewed , for better or worse , as a place to fight both those battles rather than to escape from them is still less likely to find surcease from struggle .Expect many more Hobby Lobbies ."
-1	"Whats the most common chronic childhood disease in the United States ? Its worth remembering on Halloween that the answer is tooth decay , which is five times more common than asthma and 20 times more common than diabetes .Tooth decay affects children from all backgrounds , but its concentrated among low-income and rural populations , who have the most difficulty accessing and affording dental care . Most dentists in private practice dont accept Medicaid or public insurance , and tens of million of Americans live in areas with dentist shortages . In 2008 , only about a third of children on Medicaid received dental care under the program ( PDF ) . ( The elderly and people with disabilities are also badly underserved . ) In 2009 , untreated , preventable dental problems led to 830,000 emergency room visits .The United States health care system has many absurdities , but one of the craziest is that it treats the mouth as if it were disconnected from the rest of the body . Its easier , and more affordable , to get treated for an infection in , say , the toe .From a health perspective , this makes no sense . Your mouth is an essential human organ system ,  said Leon A. Assael , dean of the School of Dentistry at the University of Minnesota . And tooth decay will destroy it through an infectious process that [ if untreated ] will go deep into the bone of your jaw and spread into your blood stream with potentially negative systemic consequence. Dental disease is connected to many health problems and is particularly worrisome for pregnant women and diabetics .One approach gaining momentum in the United States to extend access to underserved groups is based on an idea that was pioneered in New Zealand 93 years ago , and has been adopted in more than 50 countries . The idea is to train dental therapists ,  who , like dental hygienists , work under the supervision of dentists , but who can also drill teeth and perform non-complex extractions .So far , in the United States , dental therapists provide care in three states . In Alaska , they work in 80 villages , serving about 40,000 Alaska Natives on tribal lands . Most of them didnt have a dental provider working or living in their communities previously ,  said Mary Williard , a dentist who heads the Dental Health Aide Training Program for the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium . In 2009 , Minnesota authorized the training of dental therapists to serve predominately low-income patients . Maine recently followed suit .The American Dental Association has resisted the idea for decades , arguing that it doesnt make economic sense and will consign some people to second-class care . I always smile when I hear the term simple extraction ,   said Maxine Feinberg , the associations president . Ive been a dentist for a long time and one never knows whats going to happen with an extraction.However , researchers have found dental therapy to be safe and reliable , particularly for treating children , whose care is less complex than that of adults . The evidence internationally is that you can provide outstanding care to children with dental therapists in school-based programs ,  said David A. Nash , a professor of dental education at the University of Kentucky , and a lead author of a major report on the practice ( PDF ) . Two reports released this summer by the Pew Charitable Trusts also suggested that dental therapists were cost-effective in public clinics and private dental offices .More than a dozen states are now exploring the model , part of a general trend in medicine to broaden access to care and rein in costs by reducing the dependency on specialists for care that can be well managed by others . When you look at the advent of nurse practitioners , and physician assistants , and even dental hygienists , theres always resistance initially ,  said Shelly Gehshan , director of childrens dental policy at the Pew Charitable Trusts . But after a couple of years it fades . Once five or six states authorize dental therapists , it will hit a tipping point . Its really a question of when it will become part of the dental system , not if.Among proponents of dental therapy , there is one key area of disagreement . Globally , dental therapists have mainly been placed in schools , and some researchers recommend that the United States remain faithful to this model . This is really the only place where dental therapy has truly been proven economical and effective ,  said Jay W. Friedman , a dentist and leading researcher who has studied the subject extensively . And children should receive priority consideration . They are basically non-ambulatory. If you dont have someone take them to a dentist , then you have to bring the dental care to them.In the United States , by contrast , dental therapists are being placed in public clinics , private practices and federally qualified health centers , and they are permitted to treat adults as well as children . The AARP supports dental therapy to improve care for elderly people , whose need is also great .In Alaska , after two years of post-secondary training , therapists may see patients on their own . Their supervising dentists are often a long way away , reachable by plane , boat or snowmobile ( see this map ) . Despite this fact , studies suggest that their care is effective and in line with their expertise ( PDF ) .The studies showed that the therapists were providing services that were appropriate and werent doing things that didnt need to be done ,  Williard said . They were making good judgment calls and practicing less invasively.One advantage is that the therapists come from the Alaska Native communities they serve ; they can connect better with patients and are more likely to continue to live among them . ( Dentists from minority groups are more likely to treat minority patients , but the vast majority of dentists are white . ) The therapists also study how to do motivational interviewing techniques to help patients change their behaviors ,  Williard said . In the stores , the kids see them and say , Oh no , the therapist is here . I shouldnt buy this soda pop. Those kinds of things are hard to quantify but are really important.In Minnesota , the state legislature has created two dental therapist roles  a four-year bachelors degree and a two-year masters degree  and providers are required to practice as part of a team , with a dentist in the office . To date , 42 therapists have received licenses and 35 are employed . The states early impact study reported that they were , as intended , serving thousands of new , predominantly low-income and uninsured patients , practicing safely , lowering costs , and improving patient satisfaction .The Peoples Center Health Services , a federally qualified health center in South Minneapolis , provides care primarily to immigrants from Somalia and Ethiopia . It has two dental therapists and is looking to bring on a third . Theyre a tremendous resource ,  explained Ashley Johnson , the centers chief dental officer . With the Affordable Care Act , we have more people flooding in . Many have never had dental care before . A lot of kids come in with rampant dental decay . The therapists are able to do quite a bit of dental work and allow the dentists to focus on patients who have more complex problems , like root canals and implants.Due to low reimbursement rates , dentists can not afford to treat tooth decay in most practices in Minnesota for patients on public assistance for whom the reimbursement is just 38 percent of usual fees ,  said Leon Assael of the University of Minnesotas School of Dentistry , one of two schools in the state to train dental therapists . Dental therapists reduce the unit cost of care by treating patients with dental decay on public assistance who would not otherwise be seen in the dental practice.And for some ideas on how children can enjoy Halloween fun and keep their mouths healthy , see this advice from the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry .Join Fixes on Facebook and follow updates on twitter.com/nytimesfixes .

-1	"THOUGH the recent release of Medicares physician payments cast a spotlight on the millions of dollars paid to some specialists , there is a startling secret behind Americas health care hierarchy : Physicians , the most highly trained members in the industrys work force , are on average right in the middle of the compensation pack .That is because the biggest bucks are currently earned not through the delivery of care , but from overseeing the business of medicine .The base pay of insurance executives , hospital executives and even hospital administrators often far outstrips doctors salaries , according to an analysis performed for The New York Times by Compdata Surveys : $ 584,000 on average for an insurance chief executive officer , $ 386,000 for a hospital C.E.O . and $ 237,000 for a hospital administrator , compared with $ 306,000 for a surgeon and $ 185,000 for a general doctor .And those numbers almost certainly understate the payment gap , since top executives frequently earn the bulk of their income in nonsalary compensation . In a deal that is not unusual in the industry , Mark T. Bertolini , the chief executive of Aetna , earned a salary of about $ 977,000 in 2012 but a total compensation package of over $ 36 million , the bulk of it from stocks vested and options he exercised that year . Likewise , Ronald J. Del Mauro , a former president of Barnabas Health , a midsize health system in New Jersey , earned a salary of just $ 28,000 in 2012 , the year he retired , but total compensation of $ 21.7 million .The proliferation of high earners in the medical business and administration ranks adds to the United States $ 2.7 trillion health care bill and stands in stark contrast with other developed countries , where top-ranked hospitals have only skeleton administrative staffs and where health care workers are generally paid less . And many experts say its bad value for health care dollars .At large hospitals there are senior V.P.s , V.P.s of this , that and the other ,  said Cathy Schoen , senior vice president for policy , research and evaluation at the Commonwealth Fund , a New York-based foundation that focuses on health care . Each one of them is paid more than before , and more than in any other country.She added , The pay for the top five or 10 executives at insurers is pretty astounding  way more than a highly trained surgeon.She said that executive salaries in health care increased hugely in the 90s and that the trend has continued . For example , in addition to Mr. Del Mauros $ 21.7 million package , Barnabas Health listed more than 20 vice presidents who earned over $ 350,000 on its latest available tax return ; the new chief executive earned about $ 3 million . Data released by Medicare show that Barnabas Healths hospitals bill more than twice the national average for many procedures . ( In 2006 , the hospital paid one of the largest Medicare fines ever to settle fraud charges brought by federal prosecutors . )Hospitals and insurers maintain that large pay packages are necessary to attract top executives who have the expertise needed to cope with the complex structure of American health care , where hospitals and insurers undertake hundreds of negotiations to set prices .Ellen Greene , a spokeswoman for Barnabas Health , said Mr. Del Mauros retirement package was a function of over four decades of service and reflects his exceptional legacy. Nearly $ 14 million was a cumulative payout from a deferred retirement plan , she said , and the remainder included base compensation , a bonus and an incentive planMs. Greene also said Barnabass compensation program follows I.R.S . rules and is established by an executive compensation committee with guidance from a nationally recognized compensation consultant.In many areas , the health care industry is home to the top earning executives in the nonprofit sector .And studies suggest that administrative costs make up 20 to 30 percent of the United States health care bill , far higher than in any other country . American insurers , meanwhile , spent $ 606 per person on administrative costs , more than twice as much as in any other developed country and more than three times as much as many , according to a study by the Commonwealth Fund .As a result of the systems complexity , there are many jobs descriptions for positions that often dont exist elsewhere : medical coders , claims adjusters , medical device brokers , drug purchasers  not to mention the navigators created by the Affordable Care Act .Among doctors , there is growing frustration over the army of businesspeople around them and the impact of administrative costs , which are reflected in inflated charges for medical services .Most doctors want to do well by their patients ,  said Dr. Abeel A. Mangi , a cardiothoracic surgeon at the Yale School of Medicine , who is teaming up with a group at the Yale School of Management to better evaluate cost and outcomes in his department . Other constituents , such as device manufacturers , pharmaceutical companies and even hospital administrators , may not necessarily have that perspective.Doctors are beginning to push back : Last month , 75 doctors in northern Wisconsin took out an advertisement in The Wisconsin State Journal demanding widespread health reforms to lower prices , including penalizing hospitals for overbuilding and requiring that 95 percent of insurance premiums be used on medical care . The movement was ignited when a surgeon , Dr. Hans Rechsteiner , discovered that a brief outpatient appendectomy he had performed for a fee of $ 1,700 generated over $ 12,000 in hospital bills , including $ 6,500 for operating room and recovery room charges .Its worth noting that the health care industry is staffed by some of the lowest as well as highest paid professionals in any business . The average staff nurse is paid about $ 61,000 a year , and an emergency medical technician earns just about minimum wage , for a yearly income of $ 27,000 , according to the Compdata analysis . Many medics work two or three jobs to make ends meet .Its stressful , dirty , hard work , and the burnout rate is high ,  said Tom McNulty , a 19-year-old college student who volunteers for an ambulance corps outside Rochester . Though he finds it fulfilling , he said he would not make it a career : Financially , its not feasible."
-1	"The Times has a very nice survey of the results to date of the Affordable Care Act , aka Obamacare , aka death panels and the moral equivalent of slavery .The verdict : Its going well . A big expansion in coverage , which is affordable for a large majority ; the main exceptions seem to be people who went for the minimum coverage allowed , keeping premiums down but leaving large co-payments . None of the predictions of disaster has come even slightly true ."
-1	"The good news about Obamacare so far shouldnt be considered disputable . Enrollments really are above target ; multiple independent surveys show a sharp drop in the uninsured population ; health care cost growth really has slowed dramatically , whatever the reason ; the newly insured are generally satisfied with their coverage . If you want to insist that big problems lie ahead , fine ( but please explain ) , but the facts so far are pretty good .But what Im getting  and what you get whenever you suggest that things are going OK  is an outpouring , not so much of disagreement , as of fury . People get red-in-the-face angry , practically to the point of incoherence , over the suggestion that its not a disaster .Whats that about ? Partly it may be Obama derangement syndrome . I was struck by mail I received after my last column accusing me of shilling for Obama and refusing to admit what a disaster hes been  when the column didnt so much as mention the guy . Obamacare was a label stuck on the Affordable Care Act by its opponents , to tie the president to the disaster to come ; now theyre livid that it , and he , are turning out OK .Partly it may be general hatred for any kind of program that helps the less fortunate , especially if they happen to be , you know , not white . Such programs must be disasters  dont bother me with evidence .And partly , I suspect , theres now an element of shame . If this thing is actually working , everyone who yelled about how it would be a disaster ends up looking fairly stupid .But , you know , sometimes looks dont deceive ."
-1	"RISING health care costs are busting the federal budget as well as those of states , counties and municipalities . Policy makers and health care leaders have spent decades trying to figure out what to do about this .Yet their solutions are failing because of a fundamental and largely unrecognized problem : We dont know what it costs to deliver health care to individual patients , much less how those costs compare to the outcomes achieved .When insurance companies or government bodies try to control costs , they usually make across-the-board reimbursement cuts that ultimately are unsustainable because they have no connection to the true costs of delivering care . Providers themselves do not measure their costs correctly . They assign costs to patients based on what they charge , not on the actual costs of the resources , like personnel and equipment , used to care for the patient . The result is that attempts to cut costs fail , and total health care costs just keep rising .Regardless of what decision the Supreme Court reaches on the legality of the Affordable Care Act , measuring outcomes and costs is indispensable to driving improvements .Because health care charges and reimbursements have become disconnected from actual costs , some procedures are reimbursed very generously , while others are priced below their actual cost or not reimbursed at all . This leads many providers to expand into well-reimbursed procedures , like knee and hip replacements or high-end imaging , producing huge excess capacity for these at the same time that shortages persist in poorly reimbursed but critical services like primary and preventive care .The lack of cost and outcome information also prevents the forces of competition from working : Hospitals and doctors are reimbursed for performing lots of procedures and tests regardless of whether they are necessary to make their patients get better . Providers who excel and achieve better outcomes with fewer visits , procedures and complications are penalized by being paid less .Our research and executive workshops show that many sites are already improving their measurements of patient outcomes . But they have done little to measure the actual costs of achieving those outcomes . We are currently working with several health care organizations , including MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston , Childrens Hospital Boston , Partners Healthcare in Boston and Schn Klinik in Germany , that are beginning to figure out how to measure costs . They use teams of clinicians and administrators to identify all the processes involved in care , from a patients first contact with a health care provider through his or her inpatient stay and outpatient follow-up care . The teams then identify the quantity and unit cost of each resource  clinical staff , equipment , supplies , devices and administrative support  used in each process and add these together to learn the total cost of a patients care .The information helps them discover immediate and significant opportunities for improvements in care and reduced spending . MD Anderson , for example , has studied its evaluation process for new head and neck cancer patients . By substituting trained staff members for physicians , standardizing processes and improving information technology , it has been able to make care more efficient without any adverse effect on patient outcomes . It has made changes that reduced total costs by 36 percent , and freed employees to serve more patients without adding to costs .A surgeon repairing cleft palates at Childrens Hospital Boston discovered that 40 percent of the total cost of an 18-month-care process was due to the time a child spent in the intensive care unit before and after surgery . By using a far less intensively staffed and equipped observation room , the hospital could achieve equivalent quality and safety at much lower costs .Most health care providers have hundreds of these opportunities to use time , equipment and facilities more intelligently . These opportunities have been obscured by existing costing systems that have little connection to the processes actually performed .With accurate information on outcomes and costs , providers can improve care and save money by eliminating things that dont help the patient , like multiple check-ins and medical histories , tests that provide little new information and long waiting times . Many routine tasks are performed today by highly trained doctors and nurses . These tasks can be shifted to others , freeing the most skilled clinicians for far more productive work .Health care providers with expensive and poorly utilized equipment , space and staff can see the benefits of consolidating services to improve utilization and reduce some existing capacity . They can also perform routine services in lower-cost locations , reserving expensive medical centers for complex care .These opportunities will allow the health care needs of an aging population to be met with little need to increase spending . Understanding costs could be the single most powerful lever to transform the value of health care . This would give payers and providers the data they need to improve patient care , and to stop arbitrary cuts and counterproductive cost shifting ."
-1	"I WAS standing by my 89-year-old mothers hospital bed when she asked a doctor , Is there anything you can do here to give me back the life I had last year , when I wasnt in pain every minute ?  The young medical resident , stunned by the directness of the question , blurted out , Honestly , maam , no.And so Irma Broderick Jacoby went home and lived another year , during which she never again entered a hospital or subjected herself to an invasive , expensive medical procedure . The pain of multiple degenerative diseases was eased by prescription drugs , and she died last November after two weeks in a hospice , on terms determined by explicit legal instructions and discussions with her children  no respirators , no artificial feeding , no attempts to buy one more day for a body that would not let her turn over in bed or swallow without agony .The hospice room and pain-relieving palliative care cost only about $ 400 a day , while the average hospital stay costs Medicare over $ 6,000 a day . Although Moms main concern was her comfort and dignity , she also took satisfaction in not running up Medicare payments for unwanted treatments and not leaving private medical bills for her children to pay . A third of the Medicare budget is now spent in the last year of life , and a third of that goes for care in the last month . Those figures would surely be lower if more Americans , while they were still healthy , took the initiative to spell out what treatments they do  and do not  want by writing living wills and appointing health care proxies .As the aging baby boom generation places unprecedented demands on the health care system , there is little ordinary citizens can do  witness the tortuous arguments in the Supreme Court this week over the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act  to influence either the cost or the quality of the treatment they receive . However , end-of-life planning is one of the few actions within the power of individuals who wish to help themselves and their society . Too few Americans are shouldering this responsibility .Of course many people want more aggressive treatment than my mother . And advance directives arent death panels ; they can also be used to ensure the deployment of every tool of modern medicine . They can be changed or withdrawn at any time by a mentally competent person .But public opinion polls consistently show that most Americans , like my mother , worry about too much rather than too little medical intervention . In a Pew Research Center poll released in 2006 , only 22 percent said a doctor should always try to save a patients life , while 70 percent believed that patients should sometimes be allowed to die . More than half said they would tell their doctor to end treatment if they were in great pain with no hope of improvement .Yet only 69 percent had discussed end-of-life care with a spouse ; just 17 percent , or 40 percent of those over 65 , had done so with their children . One-third of Americans had a living will and even fewer have taken the more legally enforceable measure of appointing a health care proxy to act on their behalf if they can not act for themselves .The latter omission is especially disturbing because by 2030 , more than 8.5 million Americans will be over 85  an age at which roughly half will suffer from Alzheimers disease or some other form of irreversible dementia . For many members of the baby boom generation  more likely to be divorced and childless than their parents  there may be no legal next of kin .Without advance directives , even a loving child may be ignorant of her parents wishes . My mother remained conscious and in charge of her care until just a few days before she died , but like most women over 85 , she was a widow . My younger brother died of pancreatic cancer two weeks before she did . It was an immense comfort to me , at a terrible time , to have no doubts about what she wanted .My mother drew up her directives in the 1980s , when she was a volunteer in the critical care lounge of her local hospital . She once watched , appalled , as an adult daughter threw a coffeepot at her brother for suggesting that their comatose mothers respirator be turned off . Because the siblings could not agree and the patient had no living will , she was kept hooked up to machines for another two weeks at a cost ( then ) of nearly $ 80,000 to Medicare and $ 20,000 to her family  even though her doctors agreed there was no hope .The worst imaginable horror for my mother was that she might be kept alive by expensive and painful procedures when she no longer had a functioning brain . She was equally horrified by the idea of family fights around her deathbed . I dont want one of you throwing a coffeepot at the other ,  she told us in a half-joking , half-serious fashion .There is a clear contradiction between the value that American society places on personal choice and Americans reluctance to make their own decisions , insofar as possible , about the care they will receive as death nears . Obviously , no one likes to think about sickness and death . But the politicization of end-of-life planning and its entwinement with religion-based culture wars provide extra , irrational obstacles to thinking ahead when it matters most .As someone over 65 , I do not consider it my duty to die for the convenience of society . I do consider it my duty , to myself and younger generations , to follow the example my mother set by doing everything in my power to ensure that I will never be the object of medical intervention that can not restore my life but can only prolong a costly living death ."
-1	"SINCE the early 1970s , studies have shown that black Americans have a higher death rate from cancer than any other racial or ethnic group . This is especially true when it comes to breast cancer . A study published last week in the journal Cancer Epidemiology found that , in a survey of 41 of Americas largest cities , black women with breast cancer are on average 40 percent more likely to die than their white counterparts .The principal reason for this disparity is the disconnect between the nations discovery and delivery enterprises  between what we know and what we do about sick Americans .In 1967 , I started working in Harlem as a cancer surgeon . At that time , and through the 1980s , Harlem was a community of poor black people , and the death rate from cancer there was among the highest in the country . At Harlem Hospital , the five-year survival rate for breast cancer was a dismal 39 percent , compared with roughly 75 percent for Americans over all .I imagined that I could cut cancer out of Harlem. But I soon learned that the disease would not yield to a surgeons knife . Why ? Because the patients were coming in too late . I examined many black women who were visiting the clinic for the first time and who already had incurable breast cancer , sometimes with ulcerated and bleeding breast masses .I began to see that cancers invasiveness was deeply rooted in human conditions , and began asking questions such as : What does it mean to be black in America ? What does it mean to be poor ? And what does it mean to be black and poor and at the same time to have cancer ? Saving lives under these conditions has dominated my career ever since .The reasons for black and white differences in breast cancer outcomes are complex . Although the incidence of the disease is higher among white women , black women are more likely to die from it . Young black women tend to develop a particularly aggressive form , which no doubt contributes to the disparity . But for many years , the dominant cause of higher mortality has been late-stage disease at the time of initial treatment , in part as a result of black women being less likely to undergo mammography .However , this gap has been closed . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that the rate of mammography is now the same in black and white women . What remains different is what happens after the mammogram : Black women experience significant delays in diagnosis and treatment . According to the C.D.C. , even when they have similar insurance coverage , 20 percent of black women with an abnormal mammogram wait more than 60 days for a diagnosis , compared with 12 percent of white women . And 31 percent of black women wait 30 days to begin treatment , compared with 18 percent of white women .The Institute of Medicine reported in 2003 that black Americans with health insurance similar to that of white Americans are , at times , less likely to be recommended by physicians to receive curative cancer care . I dont think this is because doctors are racist , but rather that they make assumptions about race that can be harmful . For example , a specialist treating a poor black woman may doubt that she will comply with a complex treatment and recommend a simpler , but noncurative , therapy instead .The good news is that studies show that black and white women who receive the same breast cancer treatment at the same stage of the disease are equally likely to survive . If we can eliminate barriers to early diagnosis and quality treatment in black women , we can close the racial mortality gap .In 1971 , Richard M. Nixon declared a war on cancer and signed the National Cancer Act , resulting in well-justified increases in the nations investment in cancer research . But the act said nothing about the other crucial aspect of saving lives : the delivery of care . As a result , not all Americans have benefited equally from scientific and medical progress .Similarly , in recent years , the debate has focused on screening , with much less concern about what happens after . We should be expanding access to mammograms and colonoscopies , and debating the frequency and ages at which they are offered . But today , too many people are reluctant to undergo screening at all , because they fear they can not afford treatment if they are found to have cancer . Screening is much less effective if we can not ensure access to timely care .At Harlem Hospital , we provided free breast cancer screening beginning in 1979 . But screening alone was not enough . Patients  who not only often lacked health insurance , but also struggled with a limited education and distrust of doctors  needed help making their way through the medical system . So in 1990 , we pioneered the patient navigation program , which provided one-on-one support to patients with abnormal findings . The navigators helped patients obtain insurance , made sure they understood what was recommended , guided them through appointments and allayed their fears . Applying the two interventions in Harlem  breast cancer screening and patient navigation  raised the five-year breast cancer survival rate from 39 percent to 70 percent in 2000 .In 2005 , President George W. Bush signed the Patient Navigator Outreach and Chronic Disease Prevention Act , based on the Harlem model , which provided funds for these programs . In 2012 , the American College of Surgeons made patient navigation a standard of care , required for cancer centers seeking accreditation beginning next year . And the Affordable Care Act required that patient navigators be used to help Americans obtain insurance under the exchanges .The health care reform act is an excellent start toward providing universal health insurance . But access to insurance does not assure access to quality health care , especially for the poor and less educated . No patient with cancer should go untreated or experience a delay in treatment that diminishes survival . People should not die from cancer because they are poor or black . This is more than a medical and scientific issue . This is a moral issue ."
-1	"Today , the solution he developed could transform health care .Arora had been specializing since 1990 on the treatment of chronic hepatitis C , a disease that affects 3 million Americans ( and 170 million people around the world ) . Most Americans dont know theyre infected , which is one reason why it remains the leading cause of cirrhosis and liver cancer , resulting in 15,000 deaths each year in the United States , and 350,000 deaths globally .In 1990 , when drugs started emerging to treat the disease , the cure rate was just 6 percent . By 2003 , however , the cure rate had climbed to 45 percent for some patients , and 70 percent for others ( depending on their genotypes ) . It had become a curable disease ,  Arora recalled . ( New medications have further improved the efficacy , safety and ease of treatment for hepatitis C , but high costs remain a barrier . )The few specialists in New Mexico who treated it were in urban centers , and most patients went without treatment . Those who sought help had to wait six to eight months to get an appointment in a clinic . Many could not afford to drive hundreds of miles to Albuquerque , let alone make an average of 12 to 18 trips to complete a course of treatment .The result : less than 5 percent of the estimated 34,000 chronic hepatitis C patients in New Mexico had been treated . It was estimated that 2,400 inmates in New Mexicos prisons were infected with the hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) . As of 2003 , not one had received treatment for it .The people who werent very sick yet couldnt get into the clinics ,  Arora said . And the people who got in already had liver cancer or their liver was failing and it was too late to treat . So it was very frustrating . The thought came to me : If only I could expand my capacity in some way , and reflect my expertise on a much larger number of patients , lives could be saved.Could a system be built to demonopolize health care knowledge ? To move it out of the heads of specialists into networks of primary care providers in remote places so they could manage complex illnesses in their local settings ? And could rural clinicians provide care that was on a par with specialists ?Arora set out traveling around New Mexico , recruiting local providers one by one , explaining how hepatitis C was killing their patients , that there were effective treatments for it , but they were complicated to manage . He made an offer . If they volunteered to spend two hours a week with him , he and other specialists would work with them in close collaboration until they could manage their own cases .People came on board and Project ECHO came to life . In Albuquerque , Arora pulled together a team of specialists and they developed a model that combined video conferencing technology to facilitate weekly case-based training ( similar to the teaching approach in medical schools ) with collaborative care and careful patient tracking . With funding from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation , Project ECHO spread across the state .In 2011 , the New England Journal of Medicine published a study that compared the cure rates of patients treated at the University of New Mexicos HCV clinic with those treated by primary care clinicians in 21 remote ECHO sites , including federal and state run health centers and five prisons . The study reported that the primary care clinicians achieved slightly better cure rates and their patients had fewer serious adverse events . The research suggested that , when treated in local settings , patients adhered better to treatments ; and primary care doctors more familiar with patients medical histories and personal situations could better coordinate care and anticipate problems .This is an example of what the Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen has called a disruptive innovation  an innovation that enables a large number of people who previously lacked resources or skills to do or get something important , often by themselves . What its doing is moving complex expertise to the front lines of the health care system , observed Nancy Barrand , a senior adviser at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation , which has worked closely with Project ECHO .Donald Berwick , the former administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , who is currently running for governor of Massachusetts , observed that Project ECHOs model represents a fundamental design shift  from moving the patient to moving the knowledge  that is needed to build a health care system capable of meeting todays soaring demands for care . Theyve shown that with proper support the primary care workforce , including nurses , not just doctors , can function to very high levels of precision with highly complex care ,  Berwick said .Others agree . Over the past five years , Project ECHO ( short for Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes ) has spread well beyond its initial focus . It now supports ECHO hubs anchored out of 31 universities assisting providers in more than a thousand clinics who focus on 26 specialties including rheumatology ( video ) , H.I.V. , addiction , womens health , hypertension , dementia , breast cancer , childhood obesity , diabetes and chronic pain . ( Beyond the United States , the model is being used in India , Uruguay , the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland . )In 2012 , the Center for Disease Control and Prevention sponsored a replication of ECHO in Utah and Arizona , using the model to work with 90 primary care providers , 96 percent of whom had never treated a single patient with HCV . Within a year the proportion of patients treated in ECHO was twice the proportion treated in urban areas ,  said John W. Ward , who directs the Division of Viral Hepatitis at the C.D.C . It turned non-treaters into super-treaters.ECHO has also helped the Veterans Administration set up 11 hubs connected to 300 clinics around the country . Its working with the U.S. Department of Defense to improve the way the Army manages chronic pain globally ( video ) , and it recently formed a partnership with the Military Health System to set up ECHO projects within the Navy and Airforce .Through a partnership with the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation , ECHO is also helping doctors , nurse practitioners , case managers and community health workers to prevent hospitalizations among patients with multiple chronic diseases in New Mexico and Washington state .Recently , I joined a hepatitis C video conference led by Project ECHOs associate director , Karla Thornton , a specialist in infectious diseases , to see how it works . On my screen were a dozen live feeds : a team of specialists from the University of New Mexico and clinicians from places around the state like Las Cruces and Gallup and the Santa Fe Indian Hospital . They worked through cases briskly , in a collegial manner , with lots of feedback .Each case presented a different challenge . Hepatitis C treatments can be toxic , so they have to be closely managed . In one case , a 55-year-old man had grown severely depressed , a common side effect of treatment with the drug interferon . Should treatment be continued ? Lab reports appeared on screen . There were discussions of viral loads , hemoglobin levels , the ALT test , which reveals liver damage . Best to stop treatment for now .Another patient , a 58-year-old Native American woman with cirrhosis , had , after multiple requests by her doctors , gotten insurance coverage for the new drug , Sovaldi . Her viral load was now undetectable , but platelets and ANCs ( a measure of a type of white blood cell ) were worrisome . Could she come in weekly or even twice weekly to the clinic to watch for infection ? Was she a transplant candidate ?Each case presented an opportunity to connect state of the art care to front-line treatment , something the health care system does not do well . ( In 2001 , the Institute of Medicine reported that it took an average of 17 years for new evidence to be incorporated into health care practice . )The variety of cases was interesting and useful for teaching . In a period of two hours I could see three patients in my clinic ,  said Thornton . In that teleconference , we heard about 18 patients . For me , its so much more gratifying than just doing it one on one.You learn so much by listening to other peoples cases ,  said Laura Bush , a family nurse practitioner , at First Choice Community Healthcare , in Valencia County , 30 miles south of Albuquerque . When I hear someone elses presentation , Ill think , Oh , I need to ask about that . Or why did they do that ? Maybe somethings changed. Or something gets questioned by Dr. Arora or Dr. Thornton and they explain , Were doing this because of this study . Or this treatment would be more efficacious for this genotype. Hearing the same information with different cases , you start to develop pattern recognition.One of the big forces driving up health care costs is the demand for high priced specialty care  and the cost of providing it . But how do you brings costs down , and standardize quality , when demand is outstripping supply ? Thats a problem many clinicians are facing  particularly those in the military  with regard to complex pain management .When Col. Kevin Galloway , Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army Pain Management Task Force , heard about Project ECHO , his first reaction was : Were already doing this . Were the military . Of course were leveraging technology.Galloway had been using telemedicine since his days as a lieutenant in Yugoslavia in the 1990s . But that was a linear application of technology , he said . While a specialist sitting in Landstuhl Regional Medical Center was seeing patients by video , he wasnt seeing patients in his clinic . So it was not really working on the capacity issue ,  he said . By contrast , Arora characterizes ECHO as a force multiplier.What we didnt know was that the ECHO model [ had ] repurposed it in a way that was building capacity in the remote locations ,  Galloway added . It was teaching a man to fish rather than giving him a fish . It allowed us a way to grow and manage the transformation all across army medicine pain care.Its no accident that ECHO emerged in Albuquerque , rather than , say , Boston . One of the principles of disruptive innovations is that they often emerge where there is nothing else to compete with . It probably couldnt have been successful if it hadnt started in poor areas with patients that nobody else was serving ,  said Barrand .The Army has had to work to encourage its pain specialists to rethink their fundamental roles , to see themselves as mentors and collaborators on a level playing field with primary caregivers , said Galloway . Its not good enough to have smart people sitting in specialty care if they hold that knowledge to themselves.This approach runs up against the stratifications of the American health system , where specialists now stand to earn two to four times as much money as primary care doctors on average  one reason only 25 percent of new physicians are going into primary care . At the same time , physicians and nurses are suffering from high levels of burnout and depression .In this context , one of the potential attractions of Project ECHO is the satisfaction it offers through collaboration . Ive developed relationships with many primary care providers ,  said Thornton . They call me all the time . We have this sort of community of practice thats very enjoyable to be a part of.Those relationships can be particularly enriching to clinicians in rural settings . Lore Pease , Chief Executive Officer of El Centro Family Health in Espaola , which covers an area of 22,000 square miles in northern New Mexico , says Project ECHO has helped her to retain providers , a major challenge in rural areas . Weve had providers whove told us , I wont stay long ,  but they do ,  she said . Because we can offer a specialty for them to learn and expand their knowledge and expertise . Its a whole new adventure and a whole new challenge.A big barrier Project ECHO faces as it continues to spread is the way we pay for health care  the fee-for-service model , which currently provides little monetary incentive for clinicians to exchange knowledge this way , even if in the long term society stands to save oodles of money by strengthening primary care .Currently , primary care clinicians volunteer their time to participate in video clinics , and they typically earn less by seeing complex patients , because they get paid per visit and these visits take more time . Specialists get paid primarily through grants . Project ECHO received major support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to expand the model in New Mexico and Washington state , and later to spread nationally . The project has also received funding from the GE and Helmsley Foundations , as well as federal and state government sources . But for ECHO to become a national model governments and insurance companies will need to advance a standardized reimbursement approach to support its work .Its hard to imagine that these changes wont gain more traction . Under the Affordable Care Act , 32 million Americans are expected to gain coverage and many will be coming from underserved rural and urban areas , and will have chronic illnesses . How will they be cared for ? At some point in the future I cant imagine a primary care clinician not connected to an ECHO clinic ,  says Barrand . It wouldnt make sense.ECHO is allowing clinicians to reconnect with the reasons for being a doctor ,  adds Arora . Its about working to enhance your knowledge , to develop yourself as a professional , and to deliver the highest quality care for the right reasons . And its about building a community to solve a major problem in society.Join Fixes on Facebook and follow updates on twitter.com/nytimesfixes .

-1	"LOS ANGELES  MUCH of the discussion over the Affordable Care Act has focused on whether it will bring down health care costs . Less attention has been paid to another goal of the act : improving patient safety . Each year tens of thousands of people die , and hundreds of thousands more are injured , as a result of medical error .Experts agree that the best way to reduce medical error is to gather and analyze information about past errors with an eye toward improving future care . But many believe that a major barrier to doing so is the medical malpractice tort system : the threat of being sued is believed to prevent the kind of transparency necessary to identify and learn from errors when they occur .New evidence , however , contradicts the conventional wisdom that malpractice litigation compromises the patient safety movements call for transparency . In fact , the opposite appears to be occurring : the openness and transparency promoted by patient safety advocates appear to be influencing hospitals responses to litigation risk .I recently surveyed more than 400 people responsible for hospital risk management , claims management and quality improvement in health care centers around the country , in cooperation with the American Society of Health Care Risk Managers , and I interviewed dozens more .My interviewees confirmed that while hospitals historically took an adversarial and secretive approach to lawsuits and error , that has begun to change . In recent years , hospitals have become increasingly open with patients : over 80 percent of hospitals in my study have a policy of apologizing to patients when errors occur . And hospitals are more willing to discuss and learn from errors with hospital staff .What accounts for these changes ? Several factors appear to have overcome historical resistance to transparency , including widespread laws requiring disclosure to patients and confidentiality protections for internal discussions of error . Hospitals have also found that disclosing errors to patients and offering early settlements reduces the costs and frequency of litigation .My study also shows that malpractice suits are playing an unexpected role in patient safety efforts , as a source of valuable information about medical error . Over 95 percent of the hospitals in my study integrate information from lawsuits into patient safety efforts . And risk managers and patient-safety personnel overwhelmingly report that lawsuit data have proved useful in efforts to identify and address error .One might think that hospitals would have little to learn from lawsuits , given other requirements that hospitals report , investigate and analyze medical error . But participants in my study said that lawsuits can reveal previously unknown incidents of medical errors  particularly diagnostic and treatment errors with delayed manifestations that other reporting systems are not designed to collect .Lawsuits can also reveal errors that should have been reported but were not  medical providers notoriously underreport errors ( although studies have shown that the threat of litigation is not responsible for this underreporting ) and lawsuits may fill these gaps .Moreover , litigation discovery can unearth useful details about safety and quality concerns . Analyses of claim trends can reveal problematic procedures and departments , and closed litigation files can serve as rich teaching tools .True , malpractice litigation data also have many flaws : too few malpractice claims are filed to reflect an accurate picture of a hospitals shortcomings , and the amount awarded in litigation may not reflect the merits of the claims . Yet hospitals say they recognize and account for these flaws in their review .The assumed negative effects of malpractice litigation on patient safety have been used to justify numerous proposals for reform , including damages caps and health courts ,  administrative bodies that adjudicate malpractice claims outside the tort system . Politicians , patient safety advocates and medical providers argue that such reforms will encourage more open discussions of medical error by removing the specter of liability .My study suggests , however , that hospitals can  and have  found ways to increase openness and transparency without these dramatic interventions . Moreover , because lawsuits help to identify incidents and details of medical error , limitations on lawsuits may actually impede patient safety efforts .The Affordable Care Act pours millions into patient safety for research centers , demonstration projects and other programs . Proposed reforms and initiatives should not rely on conventional wisdom about the negative effects of malpractice litigation . Medical-malpractice lawsuits do not have the harmful effects on patient safety that they are imagined to have  and , in fact , they can do some good ."
-1	"AtlantaWE know that too many Americans cant afford primary care and end up in the emergency room with asthma or heart failure . But in the debate over health care coverage , less attention has been paid to the fact that too many Americans also end up in the emergency room with severe tooth abscesses that keep them from eating or infections that can travel from decayed teeth to the brain and , if untreated , kill .More than 830,000 visits to emergency rooms nationwide in 2009 were for preventable dental problems . In my state of Georgia , visits to the E.R . for oral health problems cost more than $ 23 million in 2007 . According to more recent data from Florida , the bill exceeded $ 88 million . And dental disease is the No . 1 chronic childhood disease , sending more children in search of medical treatment than asthma . In a nation obsessed with high-tech medicine , people are not getting preventive care for something as simple as tooth decay .Its easy to understand why . Close to 50 million Americans live in rural or poor areas where dentists do not practice . Most dentists do not accept Medicaid patients . And the shortage of dentists is going to get only worse : by 2014 , under the Affordable Care Act , 5.3 million more children will be entitled to dental benefits from Medicaid and the Childrens Health Insurance Program . Little is being done  by the dental profession or by the federal or state governments  to prepare for it .During the physician shortage of the middle of the last century , the federal government began creating about 50 new medical schools , doubling the number of graduating doctors . Today our government can and should train more dentists to address the long-term problem . But there is no guarantee that the new recruits would practice in underserved areas , and we need practitioners now .A more immediate solution is to train dental therapists who can provide preventive care and routine procedures like sealants , fillings and simple extractions outside the confines of a traditional dentists office . Dental therapists are common worldwide , and yet in the United States they practice only in Alaska and Minnesota , where state law allows it . Legislation is pending in five more states .The dental profession has resisted efforts to allow midlevel providers to deliver this kind of care , and the government has so far failed to push for the change . It must do so now . The federal government could encourage states to pass laws allowing these providers to practice by calling for demonstration projects proving their worth .The best model for how this system can work is found in remote Alaska Native villages , many accessible only by plane , snowmobile or dogsled , where high school seniors once graduated with full sets of dentures . Unable to recruit dentists to these areas , Alaska has been training its own dental therapists .When Alaska began the project in 2003 , there were no training programs in the country , so the state first sent students to New Zealand , which had a rigorous training program for dental therapists . These therapists now travel to small clinics and schools , often carrying their equipment with them . They consult with a supervising dentist from the region but do most procedures themselves . Many were raised in the communities in which they now work , so they understand the culture , children trust them and they have quickly become local health care leaders . Thanks to the program , around 35,000 people now live in communities where there is regular access to dental care .We have two years to prepare before millions of children will be entitled to access to dental care , and Alaska shows us the way forward . Access means more than having an insurance card ; it means having professionals available to provide care . Public officials should foster the creation of these midlevel providers  and dentists should embrace the opportunity to broaden the profession so they can expand services to those in need ."
-1	"LEXINGTON , Ky.  Political campaigns arent generally associated with specificity or truth-telling and political debates are no different . But at Monday nights debate in Lexington , both Senator Mitch McConnell and his Democratic challenger , Alison Lundergan Grimes , the Kentucky Secretary of State , reached absurd heights in the art of weasel-wording .Ms. Grimes knew the question was coming , since shes fielded it several times in the last few days . The host of the debate , Bill Goodman , asked Ms. Grimes for whom shed voted in the 2012 presidential election . Ill take a wild guess here that Ms. Grimes , a Democrat who was a member of the Kentucky delegation to the Democratic National Convention two years ago , went for the Democrat : Barack Obama . But she refused to say  because shes petrified of being linked with the president , who is deeply unpopular in Kentucky . Instead , she took umbrage on the grounds that the Kentucky constitution guarantees ballot box secrecy . She actually made the preposterous claim that by ducking the question she was standing on constitutional principle .Mr. McConnell then made her look foolish by freely sharing his votes in the 2008 and 2012 presidential contests , as well as in the 2010 Senate race , when he voted for Trey Grayson , who lost to Rand Paul , the Tea Party darling .Mr. McConnell , whos been in Washington long enough 30 years  to know how to speak without communicating any information , had plenty of opportunity to show off his considerable obfuscation skills .Is the minimum wage a living wage , Mr. Goodman asked Mr. McConnell . Its an entry-level wage ,  said Mr. McConnell , hardly an answer .Is climate change real ? Before he could plead that he was not a scientist ,  Mr. Goodman pointed out that although the senator was not an economist , he was willing to share his opinions on the economy . In a tight spot , Mr. McConnell said : There are a bunch of scientists who feel there is a problem and maybe we can do something about it.Lest he be accused of siding with environmentalists , he added the caveat that scientists in the 1970s thought we were moving toward an ice age , and closed by declaring that his job , as United States Senator from Kentucky , was to fight for coal jobs in the state .Mr. McConnell approached Ms. Grimess ballot box secrecy-level of absurdity when Mr. Goodman asked him if Obamacare and Kynect had been a boon or bane for the state . The difficulty for Mr. McConnell is that the Affordable Care Act is politically toxic in Kentucky , while Kynect  which is the states health insurance program created under the Affordable Care Act  is a runaway success .Mr. McConnells attempt to separate the two made no sense . The Affordable Care Act should be pulled out root and branch. As for Kynect , thats just a website . It was paid for by a grant . The website can continue.Seeking clarity , Mr. Goodman asked if Mr. McConnell would support the continuation of Kynect . Yeah , I think its fine to have a website , yeah ,  said the senator .Thats like saying that Google should cease to exist but that Google.com should live on ."
-1	"PHILADELPHIA  A FEW months ago , a patient came to our hospital , seeking help . One of us , Edward , was on the team that treated him . He was pleasant , if slightly withdrawn , and cogent . He was a college graduate in his 20s and had recently been fired from his job as a high school math teacher , because of unexpected absences . He had come to believe that government agents were conspiring against him , and he had taken to living out of a truck and sleeping in different parking lots . By the time he came to us , he was exhausted . A diagnosis became clear : he had schizophrenia .We admitted him to the hospital , and after a few days , with his symptoms under control , we released him . Unfortunately , we prescribed a medication for him that could cause significant , permanent harm , instead of an equally effective drug with milder side effects  all because he was uninsured .Schizophrenia , which affects 1 percent of the population and emerges in the late teens to early 20s , is deeply misunderstood . People who suffer from it are often suspected of being dangerous , but this is not usually the case , and antipsychotic drugs are very effective . Our patient was exactly the kind of person who , with the right treatment , could have weakened the stigma surrounding schizophrenia .Antipsychotic drugs fall into two classes : the older ones , like Haldol , and newer ones , like Abilify and Latuda . Both classes are equally effective at treating some of the worst symptoms of schizophrenia , specifically the hallucinations , delusions and paranoia that cause social alienation . ( Theyre not effective for treating negative symptoms ,  like low motivation . )But the older drugs can cause a multitude of serious side effects , including a potentially devastating one called tardive dyskinesia . This condition involves unsettling , animalistic smacking and wagging of the lips and tongue . At its extreme , it can affect the entire body . It occurs in 20 percent or more of patients who take the drugs long-term , and it tends to start so mildly that patients cant identify it in time to stop taking the drugs . It is often irreversible .The newer drugs have lower rates of tardive dyskinesia ( estimates vary , but most likely less than half or one-third the risk ) , although they can cause weight gain and predisposition to diabetes , among other side effects . The newest among them , however , have decreased these risks , too . And a 2006 study showed that patients were more likely to keep taking the new drugs than the older ones .As a result , most psychiatrists prefer the newer drugs , especially for younger people , and they should have been the clear choice for our patient .He didnt have the luxury of choice , however , because he was uninsured , and he was explicit about the fact that he didnt have much money to spend on medications . So we had to prescribe him Haldol , which costs about $ 20 per month , instead of one of the newer drugs , which can cost more than $ 600 per month .Had our patient been lower functioning , he might have qualified for disability benefits and Medicaid , which would have covered the new drugs . Many people who are much more severely affected  homeless individuals who are floridly psychotic , for example  receive the newest and best of our antipsychotics . They spend more time in the hospital and get more intensive case management .Our patient was , in effect , penalized for being employable . People with schizophrenia are especially poorly suited for an employer-based health insurance system , because even if they are capable of working , their symptoms can lead to frequent job changes and firings . The Affordable Care Act should help , as it expands Medicaid to all people earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty line . Pennsylvania , however , has so far decided not to participate in the expansion .Some might argue that our treatment choice was an example of cost-effective medicine . New antipsychotics arent clearly more cost-effective than older ones , so why not save hundreds of dollars per month ? For our patient , though , it isnt simply the difference between more or fewer symptoms . Its potentially the difference between a life spent gainfully employed thanks to consistent treatment , and a life spent in and out of treatment and increasingly out of control , stopping and starting medication , and always under threat of a disfiguring side effect .A 2002 study showed that 70 percent of those with well-controlled schizophrenia still worried about being viewed unfavorably because of their illness . Better treatment for patients like ours is an important step in changing this . Hopefully he can become a model of how well those with schizophrenia can integrate into society . But if he ends up getting tardive dyskinesia , he may be alienated even further .These issues will be amplified as progress is made in discovering the mechanisms of psychiatric disease , as it likely will be , thanks to the billions of dollars that are now going to neuroscience research . We can already see the results of that kind of investment in oncology , where extravagantly expensive specialty drugs are coming on the market . But as we make much-needed progress and develop new , expensive treatments that are clearly superior to old , cheap ones , we have to ask : Will those with the most to gain still receive a lower standard of care ?"
-1	"Hanover , N.H .BY 1990 , many doctors were recommending hormone replacement therapy to healthy middle-aged women and P.S.A . screening for prostate cancer to older men . Both interventions had become standard medical practice .But in 2002 , a randomized trial showed that preventive hormone replacement caused more problems ( more heart disease and breast cancer ) than it solved ( fewer hip fractures and colon cancer ) . Then , in 2009 , trials showed that P.S.A . screening led to many unnecessary surgeries and had a dubious effect on prostate cancer deaths .How would you have felt  after over a decade of following your doctors advice  to learn that high-quality randomized trials of these standard practices had only just been completed ? And that they showed that both did more harm than good ? Justifiably furious , Id say . Because these practices affected millions of Americans , they are locked in a tight competition for the greatest medical error on record .The problem goes far beyond these two . The truth is that for a large part of medical practice , we dont know what works . But we pay for it anyway . Our annual per capita health care expenditure is now over $ 8,000 . Many countries pay half that  and enjoy similar , often better , outcomes . Isnt it time to learn which practices , in fact , improve our health , and which ones dont ?To find out , we need more medical research . But not just any kind of medical research . Medical research is dominated by research on the new : new tests , new treatments , new disorders and new fads . But above all , its about new markets .We dont need to find more things to spend money on ; we need to figure out whats being done now that is not working . Thats why we have to start directing more money toward evaluating standard practices  all the tests and treatments that doctors are already providing .There are many places to start . Mammograms are increasingly finding a microscopic abnormality called D.C.I.S. , or ductal carcinoma in situ . Currently we treat it as if it were invasive breast cancer , with surgery , radiation and chemotherapy . Some doctors think this is necessary , others dont . The question is relevant to more than 60,000 women each year . Dont you think we should know the answer ?Or how about this one : How should we screen for colon cancer ? The standard approach , fecal occult blood testing , is simple and cheap . But more and more Americans are opting for colonoscopy  over four million per year in Medicare alone . Its neither simple nor cheap . In terms of the technology and personnel involved , its more like going to the operating room . ( I know , Ive had one . ) Which is better ? We dont know .Let me be clear , answering questions like these is not easy . The Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies Program is in fact preparing to take on the colonoscopy versus fecal occult blood testing question . The trial , which will involve up to 50,000 patients , will last a decade and surely cost millions of dollars .Research like this takes more than grant money . For starters , it takes a research infrastructure that monitors what standard practice is  data on whats actually happening across the country . Because of Medicare , we have a clear view for patients age 65 and older , but its a lot cloudier for those under 65 . Basic questions like how common annual physical exams are and what testing is part of them are unanswerable .It also takes a research culture that promotes a healthy skepticism toward standard medical practice . That requires physician researchers who know what standard practice is , have the imagination to question it and the skills to study it . These doctors need training thats not yet part of any medical school curriculum ; they need mentoring of senior researchers ; and they need some assurance that investigating accepted treatments can be a viable option , instead of career suicide .We have to move quickly . The administrative demands of clinical care , on one side , and the competition for research funding on the other , make it increasingly difficult for researchers to see patients . They become isolated from standard practice , and their ability to study it diminishes . Clinicians who are well positioned to study these issues are increasingly directed toward enhancing productivity  questions about how can we do this better , faster or more consistently  instead of questions about whether the practices are warranted in the first place .Heres a simple idea to turn this around : devote 1 percent of health care expenditures to evaluating what the other 99 percent is buying . Distribute the research dollars to match the clinical dollars . Figure out what works and what doesnt . The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute ( created as part of the Affordable Care Act to study the comparative effectiveness of different treatments ) is supposed to tackle questions of direct relevance to patients and could take on this role , but its budget  less than 0.03 percent of total spending  is far from sufficient .A call for more medical research might sound like pablum . Worse , coming from a medical researcher , it might sound like self-interest ( cut me some slack , thats another one of our standard practices ) . But I dont need the money . The system does . Or if you prefer , we can continue to argue about who pays for what  without knowing whats worth paying for ."
-1	"Cambridge , Mass .OF the many momentous issues the Supreme Court will take up this term , few are as volatile as same-sex marriage . In the term that began last week , the justices are expected to consider the constitutionality of the federal Defense of Marriage Act , and possibly state bans on gay marriage as well . The question looms : how might they rule ?The Defense of Marriage Act , or DOMA , the 1996 law denying federal recognition to same-sex marriages lawfully performed by states , is probably the easier case for the justices . Historically , Congress has deferred to state definitions of marriage , and several federal courts have invalidated the law on these grounds of federalism . DOMA is also vulnerable because some of its legislative sponsors defended it in blatantly homophobic terms . Polls show that a substantial majority of Americans are opposed to it . Conservative justices who value federalism and liberal justices who sympathize with gay marriage will probably combine to invalidate the act .Predicting how the justices might rule on state bans on same-sex marriage is harder , as the relevant legal doctrine  which flows from judicial precedent , textual interpretation , and social norms and traditions  is varied enough that plausible arguments can be made on both sides .On one hand , some judges  notably Justice Antonin Scalia  think the constitutional case for same-sex marriage obviously fails because nobody in 1868 , when the 14th Amendment was ratified , dreamed that its equal protection clause applied to gay marriage . The right to marriage , which is deeply rooted in American history , was traditionally limited to opposite-sex couples . And there is no Supreme Court precedent subjecting laws that classify based on sexual orientation to the rigorous judicial scrutiny that has been applied to classifications based on race or sex .On the other hand , some judges have ruled that classifications based on sexual orientation should receive such scrutiny , as gay men and lesbians have long been victims of discrimination and still face social and political obstacles . They have also argued that marriage is a fundamental right that should not be narrowly circumscribed without good reason , and have found wanting the argument that marriage bears an inherent link to procreation .If constitutional doctrine will not determine the outcome of a Supreme Court case on gay marriage , what will ? Politics .Todays justices divide five to four on virtually every important contemporary constitutional issue , including abortion , affirmative action , campaign finance , capital punishment and gun control . The court consists of two relatively stable four-person blocs of liberals and conservatives , with Anthony M. Kennedy hovering between them , usually casting the deciding vote . He has sided with the liberals in some cases involving abortion , the death penalty , and other civil liberties issues , but with the conservatives in most other cases . Gay marriage is likely to turn on Justice Kennedys vote . What might it be ?Justice Kennedy could , of course , follow a compromise path and rule that the Constitution mandates at least civil unions for same-sex couples . With two-thirds of Americans supporting civil unions , such a ruling would generate little political controversy .But were Justice Kennedy to rule on gay marriage itself , his decision would most likely depend on how he balanced two competing tendencies . As in decisions invalidating state sodomy laws and barring the death penalty for minors and the mentally disabled , Justice Kennedys rulings often bolster dominant national norms and suppress dissident state practices . This approach would counsel restraint at a time when only six states and the District of Columbia permit gay marriage . ( On Election Day , same-sex marriage will be on the ballot in Maine , Maryland and Washington , and a constitutional amendment to ban it will be on the ballot in Minnesota . )However , Justice Kennedy also explicitly embraces the idea of the Constitution as a living document whose meaning reflects evolving social mores . Partly on this basis , he wrote both of the courts pro-gay-rights decisions : the 1996 opinion in Romer v. Evans , which invalidated a provision in the Colorado Constitution barring state or local governments from enacting laws forbidding discrimination based on sexual orientation , and the 2003 opinion in Lawrence v. Texas , which ruled that sodomy laws violated the due process clause of the 14th Amendment . Its also notable that Justice Kennedy treats international norms as relevant to American constitutional interpretation . Gay marriage has recently been legalized in South Africa , Canada and many European nations , and is being actively debated in others .Justice Kennedys opinions often suggest that he wants to be on the right side of history , which matters greatly here because the future of gay marriage in America is so clear . Support has increased from less than 25 percent in 1990 to roughly 35 percent in 2004 to over 50 percent today . At the current rate , a substantial majority of Americans will support gay marriage within the next dozen years .A Supreme Court ruling in favor of gay marriage would divide the nation roughly down the middle , much as the Courts ruling against racial segregation , in Brown v. Board of Education , did in 1954 . Yet , within two decades , the Brown decision was almost universally revered . A decision protecting same-sex marriage would probably also soon become historic . Indeed , some lower courts have already recognized the significance of pro-gay-marriage rulings . The author of Massachusettss pioneering gay marriage ruling compared it to that courts prohibition of slavery in the 1780s . In 2008 , the California Supreme Court struck down a ban on same-sex marriage , proudly invoking its 1948 decision that invalidated a ban on interracial marriage . ( The California ruling was subsequently superseded by Proposition 8 , a voter initiative that amended the State Constitution to ban same-sex marriage . )Of course , predicting how Supreme Court justices will vote in particular cases is risky business . Who could possibly have forecast the convoluted path that Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. took to uphold the Affordable Care Act , President Obamas signature health care legislation , last term ? But on the whole , it seems likely that when the case arises , Justice Kennedy will be tempted to write an opinion that would quickly become the Brown v. Board of the gay rights movement ."
-1	"ANDY INKSTER , a transgender man , had always wanted biological children . So when he embarked on the transition from female to male at age 18  changing his name , taking testosterone and eventually undergoing surgery to remove his breasts  he left his female reproductive organs intact .In his mid-20s , he decided it was time . He stopped taking testosterone and started trying to get pregnant . Eventually , in 2009 , after beginning graduate school at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst , he sought fertility treatment at Baystate Reproductive Medicine . Baystate was one of the few clinics in the country with an anti-discrimination policy for gender identity . And yet , it refused to treat him , arguing that it didnt have enough expertise to treat transgender patients . Mr. Inkster insisted there was no medical reason to deny him ; his baby-making parts were the same as any womans .The more than 700,000 transgender people living in the United States have long faced discrimination by health care providers . Over the past 15 years , activists have fought to compel insurers to cover transgender-related health care  from hormone therapy to gender reassignment surgery  or at least be prevented from excluding transgender clients from buying policies for basic services . Finally , starting this month , thanks to the Affordable Care Act , transsexualism can no longer be considered a pre-existing condition . Whats been left out of the spotlight : having babies . Many Americans have come to accept gay parents ; the transgender community is next in line for recognition .Mr. Inkster eventually found another clinic that helped him conceive via in vitro fertilization and donor sperm , and in October 2010 , he gave birth to a daughter , Elise . A month later , he sued Baystate for sexual discrimination .According to court documents , he was denied treatment after failing to comply with a clinic counselors request that he supply information from his current therapist that he was emotionally ready to handle pregnancy and parenting . Mr. Inkster argued that nontransgender patients werent asked to do the same . This fall , the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination  the states civil rights agency  found probable cause for Mr. Inkster . The case will next move on to a conciliation conference , and then to a possible settlement .Admittedly , the idea of a pregnant man makes many people uncomfortable , and photos of Mr. Inkster caressing his bulging belly are startling . The issue is controversial even within the transgender community . Some people believe if youre a trans man you shouldnt be wanting to bear kids ,  Jamison Green , the author of Becoming a Visible Man ,  told me . Thats not something men do . Others think , If you have a body part that does something , why cant you use it ? Its your body.The issue brings up unprecedented questions : Do you use your genetic material to reproduce , and at what time during your transition ? Before or after hormone therapy ? Before undergoing reassignment surgery that will make you sterile ? Should a transgender man like Mr. Inkster keep his breasts so he can nurse later ? Is it generally psychologically healthier for someone like him to freeze his eggs and have them inseminated and the embryos transferred to a female partner or surrogate , rather than leave his female reproductive parts intact ? How might years of estrogen or testosterone therapy affect eggs and sperm ?These questions matter . One study published last year in the journal Human Reproduction of 90 transgender men in Belgium found that 54 percent wished to have children , and 38 percent would have considered freezing their eggs if the procedure had been available . Other research , published in 2002 , by Belgian fertility doctors with Western European transgender women found that 40 percent wanted to have children , and 77 percent felt they should have the option to preserve their sperm before hormone treatment . As fertility technology improves and becomes more widely available , transgender people are realizing that they will have more options in the future .Jennifer Hastings , a family care physician based in Santa Cruz , Calif. , who specializes in transgender health care , says its tricky to balance gender identity with family desires . We have preteens who come in and say , I dont want to be a mom . I want to be a dad !   she says . On the other hand , there are youth who know they want to have biological kids from the outset and freeze sperm or eggs after going through puberty. Since some doctors are concerned that letting transgender teenagers go through puberty in the gender they dont identify with may be deeply traumatic , they might administer puberty-blocking medications that delay adolescence until the teenagers can begin hormone therapy in their desired gender . But this means the patients may give up the option of having biological children later . It can be a painful choice for their parents to make ,  says Dr. Hastings .All these paths toward creating transgender families deserve careful study . Yet these issues arent likely to get the attention they deserve until transgender people succeed in getting basic health care first .Stories of transgender people in health care settings being gawked at , mocked or interrogated about their status abound . A disturbing 2011 study by the National Center for Transgender Equality and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force of 6,450 transgender adults found that 19 percent reported having been refused treatment by a health care provider because of their gender identity , and 28 percent said they had postponed medical care because of discrimination . For those who had visited a doctors office or hospital , 24 percent said they had been denied equal treatment , 25 percent reported having been harassed or disrespected , and 2 percent had been physically assaulted .Its understandable that doctors might be nervous about not having enough training to treat people who are under long-term hormone therapy . Medical schools need to make students more aware of transgender health needs , which in most cases arent that different from everyone elses . If someone has a sore throat , they have a sore throat ,  said Dr. Hastings . Its not because of their hormones.The bigger challenge may be to get medical providers to overcome their bias . Discomfort over difference isnt an excuse to refuse compassionate care to a transgender person in an emergency room or a fertility clinic , or for insurance companies to refuse to cover that care . Gender identity has nothing to do with the desire to have children  or with who will make a good parent ."
-1	"WashingtonDESPITE high unemployment , there is one bright spot in the economy : while nearly all other sectors shrank during the recession , jobs in health care increased by more than 1.2 million , with most paying salaries of over $ 60,000 . And demand for those workers will keep improving : the Affordable Care Act will add 32 million people to insurance rolls over the next several years , while the aging of America will drive the need for health care for decades to come .But for American health workers , this is hardly good news . Despite a labor shortage , our crowded medical professional schools are turning away hundreds of thousands of qualified applicants ; to fill the gap , we are importing tens of thousands of foreign workers . Today about 12 percent of the health work force is foreign-born and trained , including a quarter of all physicians .Thats bad for American workers , but even worse for the foreign workers home countries , including some of the worlds poorest and sickest , which could use these professionals at home .The blame lies primarily with the woeful state of schools in the health professions . Despite increased demand for their graduates , they have done little to expand their output .Even worse , although the cost of higher education increased faster than inflation for the past two decades , the per graduate cost of health professional education has increased even faster : over the past 20 years , public medical school tuitions have increased 312 percent .State regulators also artificially limit the number of health professionals we can train by effectively requiring that students be trained almost exclusively in teaching hospitals , even though most go on to work in clinics or community hospitals . Not only does this limit the number of people who can be educated , but the resulting increases in tuition and length of training reduce the number of students from poor and underserved communities who apply to health professional schools in the first place .Then theres the phenomenon of credential creep : in fields like audiology , physical therapy and optometry , a therapist who once needed a masters degree must now have a doctorate to get a license , which means more years of school , higher attrition rates , higher debt , higher wage demands and fewer workers from underserved and low-income areas . The same licensing system actually favors foreign-trained health workers , who , for various reasons , do not have to meet these degree requirements .Its no surprise , then , that the response to this self-made labor shortage has been to recruit inexpensive workers from abroad , including the 57 poor countries defined by the World Health Organization as having significant shortages of their own . Among them is India , Americas largest source of foreign-trained doctors . A special visa program has made hiring these workers even easier .A Gates Foundation study recently showed that immigration , with the United States as the most common destination , was siphoning off the largest number of African medical professionals .The Global Health Workforce Alliance estimates that a billion people alive today will die without ever seeing a health care worker . Meanwhile , the W.H.O . estimates that below a threshold of 2.3 doctors , nurses and midwives per 1,000 people , countries are unable to provide even the most basic health services .Multiple studies , even when controlled for poverty , show that access to health workers is directly related to mortality and health outcomes . A meta-analysis of 13 studies of developing countries showed that newborns who live more than three miles from a staffed health facility are almost twice as likely to die than infants who live closer to one . Health workers in developing countries dont just provide clinical care  they also manage their countries health and disaster response systems , as well as nutrition and sanitation programs , all of which crumble in their absence .There are other casualties , closer to home . Every study that has examined how to incentivize health workers to move to underserved areas has shown that training people from these communities is the most cost-effective approach . But because weve essentially given up on recruiting from underserved places in the United States , weve made their chronic lack of health workers much worse . Some 54 million people live in the 5,700 parts of the country defined as health professional shortage areas ,  the communities with the worst health statistics and the worst unemployment .In response , schools should be required to pay attention to cost effectiveness and train more workers with their existing budgets . Federal money could go toward helping these schools expand .Meanwhile , the Departments of Education and Health and Human Services , which essentially let the health professions regulate their schools , could mandate that all new licensing requirements be justified with cost-effectiveness data ; they could also require schools to communicate with employers to gauge the numbers and skills of workers needed .It is irrational and immoral to recruit health workers from countries where one in five children die before their fifth birthday when we could be recruiting and training workers domestically . Doing so would help our economy , global public health and the 314 million Americans who rely on our medical system to provide high-quality , affordable care ."
-1	"I actually agree with a lot of what David Brooks says today . But  you know there has to be a but  so does a guy named Barack Obama . Which brings me to one of the enduringly weird aspects of our current pundit discourse : constant calls for a moderate , sensible path that supposedly lies between the extremes of the two parties , but is in fact exactly what Obama has been proposing .So , David says thatThe federal government should borrow money at current interest rates to build infrastructure , including better bus networks so workers can get to distant jobs . The fact that the federal government has not passed major infrastructure legislation is mind-boggling , considering how much support there is from both parties .Well , the Obama administration would love to spend more on infrastructure ; the problem is that a major spending bill has no chance of passing the House . And thats not a problem of both parties  its the GOP blocking it . Exactly how many Republicans would be willing to engage in deficit spending to expand bus networks ? ( Remember , these are the people who consider making rental bicycles available an example of totalitarian rule . )Also , theres this:the government should reduce its generosity to people who are not working but increase its support for people who are . That means reducing health benefits for the affluent elderly Hmm . The Affordable Care Act subsidizes insurance premiums for lower-income workers , and pays for those subsidies in part by eliminating overpayments for Medicare Advantage . So conservatives are celebrating both ends of that deal , right ? Oh , wait , death panels .Its an amazing thing : Obama is essentially what we used to call a liberal Republican , who faces implacable opposition from a very hard right . But Obamas moderation is hidden in plain sight , apparently invisible to the commentariat ."
-1	"Senator Mitch McConnell said yesterday that he would not shut down the government , over immigration or anything else , after he takes over as Majority Leader in January . On the same day , Speaker John Boehner refused to rule out a shutdown . Both were being deceptive , but Mr. McConnell , as usual , was a little more clever about it .The House produced last years government shutdown when it insisted on attaching the repeal of various parts of the Affordable Care Act to spending bills necessary to keep the government open . That was a huge embarrassment for Mr. Boehner , making his caucus appear feral and ungovernable , and he has no desire to repeat it . But his newly expanded Republican majority actually is a bit wilder than the outgoing one , and it is inflamed by President Obamas plans to take executive action on immigration by sparing up to 5 million people from deportation . Some on the far right want to pass no spending bills if the president takes action ; others , as National Review reported , want to shut down only specific departments , like Homeland Security ( which includes Immigration and Customs Enforcement ) .Mr. Boehner is playing his customary game of appearing provocative in public , to keep his most extreme members at bay , while trying to cut some kind of deal in private . But if he or his members think a shutdown of the Homeland Security department is going to work , theyre kidding themselves . During the last shutdown , most of the department stayed open , in part because many of its functions are considered essential and are funded by fees rather than Congressional appropriations . To have any real leverage , House Republicans would have to threaten to shut down more than that .Mr. McConnell wants his chamber to appear reasonable and governable in contrast to the House , and likes to portray himself as the leader who averts shutdowns . But hes the one who has already threatened to use spending bills to stop any environmental regulations that might restrict the burning of coal , which is the same as a shutdown threat .His plans are evident in the exact wording of his statement yesterday : Well not be shutting the government down or threatening to default on the national debt. But if he can pin the shutdown on the president , then he can claim he wasnt the one who closed the governments doors . During the last shutdown , the spending bills never reached the presidents desk for a veto , because the Houses demands were rejected by the Senate , and everything was blamed on Congressional gridlock. With Republican control of both chambers , things will be different , and a shutdown remains very much on the table ."

But hes not actually sure that an election will take place .Via Fox NewsChris Wallace : You are thinking about running for president in 2016 . And I want to talk to you about that in a moment , but it has brought attention back to some of your comments as it does to any candidate potentially running for president . You said recently that you thought that there might not actually be elections in 2016 because of widespread anarchy . Do you really believe that ? Ben Carson : Well , I hope that thats not going to be the case , but certainly there is the potential . Because you have to recognize that we have a rapidly increasing national debt . A very unstable financial foundation . And you have all these things going on like the ISIS crisis that could very rapidly change things that are going on in our nation . And unless we begin to deal with these things in a comprehensive way , and in a logical way , there is no telling what could happen in just a matter of a couple of years . And particularly in a situation where we have a Senate and a Senate leader who has over 300 bills sitting on his desk will not bring them to the floor for a vote , thereby thwarting the will of the people .

-1	"BostonTHE drastic rise in the price of oil and gasoline is in part the result of forces beyond our control : as high-growth countries like China and India increase the demand for petroleum , the price will go up .But there are factors contributing to the high price of oil that we can do something about . Chief among them is the effect of pure speculators  investors who buy and sell oil futures but never take physical possession of actual barrels of oil . These middlemen add little value and lots of cost as they bid up the price of oil in pursuit of financial gain . They should be banned from the worlds commodity exchanges , which could drive down the price of oil by as much as 40 percent and the price of gasoline by as much as $ 1 a gallon .Today , speculators dominate the trading of oil futures . According to Congressional testimony by the commodities specialist Michael W. Masters in 2009 , the oil futures markets routinely trade more than one billion barrels of oil per day . Given that the entire world produces only around 85 million actual wet barrels a day , this means that more than 90 percent of trading involves speculators exchanging paper barrels with one another .Because of speculation , todays oil prices of about $ 100 a barrel have become disconnected from the costs of extraction , which average $ 11 a barrel worldwide . Pure speculators account for as much as 40 percent of that high price , according to testimony that Rex Tillerson , the chief executive of ExxonMobil , gave to Congress last year . That estimate is bolstered by a recent report from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis .Many economists contend that speculation on oil futures is a good thing , because it increases liquidity and better distributes risk , allowing refiners , producers , wholesalers and consumers ( like airlines ) to hedge their positions more efficiently , protecting themselves against unseen future shifts in the price of oil .But its one thing to have a trading system in which oil industry players place strategic bets on where prices will be months into the future ; its another thing to have a system in which hedge funds and bankers pump billions of purely speculative dollars into commodity exchanges , chasing a limited number of barrels and driving up the price . The same concern explains why the United States government placed limits on pure speculators in grain exchanges after repeated manipulations of crop prices during the Great Depression .The market for oil futures differs from the markets for other commodities in the sheer size and scope of trading and in the impact it has on a strategically important resource . There is a fundamental difference between oil futures and , say , orange juice futures . If orange juice gets too pricey ( perhaps because of a speculative bubble ) , we can easily switch to apple juice . The same does not hold with oil . Higher oil prices act like a choke-chain on the economy , dragging down profits for ordinary businesses and depressing investment .When I started buying and selling oil more than 30 years ago for my nonprofit organization , speculation wasnt a significant aspect of the industry . But in 1991 , just a few years after oil futures began trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange , Goldman Sachs made an argument to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission that Wall Street dealers who put down big bets on oil should be considered legitimate hedgers and granted an exemption from regulatory limits on their trades .The commission granted an exemption that ultimately allowed Goldman Sachs to process billions of dollars in speculative oil trades . Other exemptions followed . By 2008 , eight investment banks accounted for 32 percent of the total oil futures market . According to a recent analysis by McClatchy , only about 30 percent of oil futures traders are actual oil industry participants .Congress was jolted into action when it learned of the full extent of Commodity Futures Trading Commissions lax oversight . In the wake of the economic crisis , the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law required greater trading transparency and limited speculators who lacked a legitimate business-hedging purpose to positions of no greater than 25 percent of the futures market.This is an important step , but limiting speculators in the oil markets doesnt go far enough . Even with the restrictions currently in place , those eight investment banks alone can severely inflate the price of oil. Federal legislation should bar pure oil speculators entirely from commodity exchanges in the United States . And the United States should use its clout to get European and Asian markets to follow its lead , chasing oil speculators from the worlds commodity markets .Eliminating pure speculation on oil futures is a question of fairness. The choice is between a world of hedge-fund traders who make enormous amounts of money at the expense of people who need to drive their cars and heat their homes , and a world where the fundamentals of life  food , housing , health care , education and energy  remain affordable for all ."
-1	"NOW that President Obama has granted legal relief to as many as five million undocumented immigrants , Republicans are thrashing about for an effective response . Only a few hard-liners are talking about impeachment now , but more could join them out of frustration with their other options .Many people in both parties have tried to quell such talk by saying the president is within his powers to issue the order . The problem is , the pro-impeachment Republicans are right : There is a plausible case for taking that step .By constitutional design , impeachment for treason , bribery , or other high crimes and misdemeanors is a political accusation and initiates a political remedy , not a legal one . It is pretty much up to Congress to define and apply high crimes and misdemeanors ,  and no court would second-guess it . The next Congress could find that the president had violated his oath to faithfully execute the laws by refusing to enforce important provisions of the Affordable Care Act , No Child Left Behind and , now , the Immigration and Nationality Act .The president surely has some power to withhold prosecution , but granting legal status and work permits to millions of people most likely exceeds his discretion . No judge can decide the precise scope of his discretion because no one , including Congress , has legal standing to challenge his order in court .Of course , many lawyers at the Justice Department and elsewhere disagree , noting that prosecutorial discretion is pervasive , that there isnt enough money to prosecute all violators , that the president will continue to prosecute criminals and illegal border crossers , and that earlier presidents have done the same thing . These are serious arguments . But as an immigration and administrative law teacher who strongly favors more legal immigration and even broader legislative relief than Mr. Obamas order grants ( and who voted for him twice ) , I find them unconvincing .In the Immigration and Nationality Act , Congress carefully limited prosecutorial discretion by allowing the president to waive exclusions and deportations only under narrowly defined conditions . The act also granted the president broad power to suspend the entry of any class of aliens he finds detrimental to the national interest  but , significantly , did not give him corresponding authority to legalize any class of undocumented people he thinks deserve it .President Obama has cited several cases of suspended enforcement as precedent . But in those cases , Congress had authorized the immigrants in question to apply for green cards ; the president merely suspended enforcement against their closest family members until they , too , could get their own cards .Most telling , Mr. Obama , a former constitutional law professor , once rejected the very arguments he now embraces . Last year he said that extending amnesty beyond the so-called Dreamers ( the children of undocumented immigrants brought here at an early age ) would be ignoring the law in a way that I think would be very difficult to defend legally. It is hard to think of a confession more damning to his position in a court of law , in a congressional court of impeachment and in the court of public opinion .Still , does his overreaching constitute an impeachable offense under the constitutional standard ? History suggests that it might . In the early 1800s , two federal judges were impeached for far less : noncriminal intoxication , indecency , bias and other judicial improprieties .True , the standard for impeaching presidents should be more demanding than for judges . Even so , in 1868 President Andrew Johnson was impeached by a deeply partisan , Radical Republican-dominated House . Johnson  a conservative Democrat who rose from the vice presidency when Abraham Lincoln , a Republican , was assassinated  was impeached mainly for firing a cabinet member ( which he almost certainly had the legal right to do ) , but also for obstructing policies that Congress enacted . ( Impeachment proceedings against Richard M. Nixon and Bill Clinton involved criminal conduct more egregious than Mr. Obamas policy unilateralism . )But even if Congress has constitutional authority to impeach the president , that doesnt mean it should . Quarrels between a president and Congress over the statutory limits on his authority are common , and the precise boundaries can be hard to discern . However truculent Mr. Obamas defiance may be on this issue , Congress has other ways to stymie it  for example , barring the action by statute . Such tactics are within the normal give-and-take of interbranch disputes . Americans , including many like me who want a legislative amnesty , would support Congresss use of them here .Impeachment , moreover , would tend to normalize its use as a political weapon , even though the framers intended that it be used only in extreme cases that endanger the republic . Only inveterate Obama haters think that is true here .The new Congress would accomplish nothing of consequence despite urgent national needs and voters demands for cooperation . This would deepen the publics growing disgust with our government , a disgust that , properly directed , can spur needed reform , but if taken too far erodes the governments capacity to do what only government can and must do . Perhaps most dangerous , impeachment of an already lame-duck president would further disable him for the next two years from defending American security and interests in a remorselessly turbulent , perilous world . All Americans should fervently pray that it doesnt come to that ."
-1	"Chapel Hill , N.C.  Over the last few weeks it has become fashionable to ridicule this election as a jumble of debates that dont resonate with the average American . The Washington Post deemed these midterms kind of  with apologies to Seinfeld  an election about nothing ,  and many other journalists have echoed the comparison . The joke is an old one : as the reigning clich had it , 2002 was the Seinfeld election  an election about nothing ,  Frank Rich wrote in these pages 12 years ago .To say that an election is about nothing means that no coherent national narrative has emerged  other than the medias obsession with the tight race for control of the Senate . Pundits and pollsters have published reams of charts predicting the final tally , but this obsession with data has further fragmented the story rather than explained what a Republican takeover would mean . Journalists have said comparatively little about what the party might do if it wins .In my state of North Carolina , the neck-and-neck contest between the Democratic senator Kay Hagan and the Republican Thom Tillis , speaker of the state House , seems to turn on one question . Who has provoked more voter outrage : the federal government or the state legislature ? But this notoriously ugly and expensive race may help explain what the 2014 midterm elections are really about . The answer is not nothing.Ms. Hagan ( and the super PACs that aid her ) have mainly aimed to mobilize women and minority voters , going so far as to accuse Mr. Tillis of leading the effort to pass the kind of Stand Your Ground laws that caused the shooting death of Trayvon Martin. Mr. Tilliss supporters have done their share of fear-mongering among black voters too . Does Kay Hagan care that one out of three babies aborted in America are black ?  asks one radio spot . Mr. Tillis has mostly run against President Obama and the senator who goes right along with him ,  in the words of one TV ad .But for North Carolinians the Senate race also serves as a referendum on the recent ideological revolution in the state : libertarians and social conservatives who gained control of both houses of the legislature in 2010 and the governors mansion in 2012 have obstructed access to abortion , blocked the advance of gay rights , cut taxes ( mainly for the wealthy ) and shrunk government investment in social services .On the left , this election is about identity politics : convincing particular groups , mainly women , African-Americans , and Latinos , that they are getting a raw deal , and that they should be angry . Dont be fooled by the fact that so-called mainstream Republicans who want to stick tightly to the anti-Obama script have tried to sideline the most clamorous voices in the Tea Party and the Christian Right . On the right , this is a contest over ideology : will North Carolinians capitulate to secularism and socialist welfare spending , or will they stand strong on the principles of Christian family values and the free market ?Here in North Carolina , the silences speak louder than the noisy vitriol . Ms. Hagan  like most of her Democratic colleagues nationwide  has avoided speaking in ideological terms . Her vague references to North Carolina values do not offer a clear vision of the role of government in balancing equality with liberty , or personal autonomy with communal responsibility . Meanwhile , Republican supporters of Mr. Tillis have painstakingly avoided the identity politics at work in his base , where the preponderance of middle-aged white men is no secret .This election has affirmed a persistent truth of American politics over the last half century : The left cant talk openly about ideology , while the right pretends to ignore its own identity politics . The countrys political conversation is boring and unsatisfying precisely because its unspoken rules forbid politicians from acknowledging what is really going on and encourage them to talk past one another .The right has so thoroughly captured the terms of economic debate that American liberals  uniquely in the Western world  champion cultural issues like same-sex marriage equality while avoiding serious confrontation with the structural sources of socio-economic inequality . Their ideological cowardice has left them turning sensible reform proposals like single-payer health insurance into the Frankensteins monster of government-subsidized private enterprise that is the Affordable Care Act . Its tough to cheerlead for a clumsy , compromised law that satisfies no one ; no wonder they have failed to persuasively defend it in this election .On the right , the steady expansion of civil rights and the onward march of secularization have compelled conservatives to accept the political rules of multiculturalism ( while occasionally reserving the right to protest in the name of religious liberty ) . But the fact that most Republican leaders  at least those deemed fit for prime time  have mastered politically correct language does not mean that the party admits that liberal identity politics reflect legitimate minority grievances . Nor does it mean that they have confronted the prejudice and self-interest in their own ranks .Americans like to think of themselves as down-to-earth problem-solvers who live in a post-ideological society  even , in their more Pollyannaish moments , an almost-post-racial one . They imagine they are immune to the noxious -isms that wracked 20th-century Europe . In 1960 , the sociologist Daniel Bell proclaimed the end of ideology : a good thing , in his view . An ideology , he wrote , looks at the world with eyes wide shut , a closed system which prefabricates answers to any questions that might be asked. At their worst , ideologies are indeed smelly little orthodoxies ,  as George Orwell put it  and identity politics can close minds , too . But at their best , they force us to confront the assumptions that drive our kneejerk reactions , to acknowledge the logic of our own beliefs and to follow that logic to its political conclusion . They force honest debate about how to balance competition between worthy but conflicting goals and can yield imaginative solutions to the challenge of living together in free society .When I ask students in my history classes to read part of Bells book , they always tell me that now that theyve stopped to look , they see that he spoke too soon . We all have assumptions and allegiances that shape our priorities and our reactions to new information : Creeds and tribalisms abound . This election is not about nothing. It turns on the basic philosophical divides and racial tensions that have defined American politics since the countrys founding . Its just too bad hardly anyone is talking about it ."
-1	"Shortly after the birth of her daughter , Andrea became severely depressed . She was 17 at the time and she didnt fully understand what she was going through ; she just felt like a failure . I felt like I didnt want to be alive ,  she recalls . I felt like I didnt deserve to be alive . I felt like a bad person and a bad mother , and I was never going to get any better.When her baby persisted in crying , she felt her frustration mount quickly . I was hitting a boiling point ,  she says . I was at a point where I didnt want to deal with anything . Sometimes I would just let her cry  but then I would feel very bad afterwards.Depression is the most common health problem women face . In the United States , outside of obstetrics , it is the leading cause of hospitalizations among women ages 15 to 44 . Its estimated that 20 percent to 25 percent of women will experience depression during their lifetimes , and about one in seven will experience postpartum depression . For low-income women , the rates are about twice as high . As my colleague Tina Rosenberg has reported , the World Health Organization ranks depression as the most burdensome of all health conditions affecting women ( as measured by lost years of productive life ) .Postpartum depressions are often assumed to be associated with hormonal changes in women . In fact , only a small fraction of them are hormonally based , said Cindy-Lee Dennis , a professor at the University of Toronto and a senior scientist at Womens College Research Institute , who holds a Canada Research Chair in Perinatal Community Health .The misconception is itself a major obstacle , she adds . Postpartum depression is often not an isolated form of depression ; nor is it typical . We now consider depression to be a chronic condition ,  Dennis says . It reoccurs in approximately 30 to 50 percent of individuals . And a significant proportion of postpartum depression starts during the pregnancy but is not detected or treated to remission . We need to identify symptoms as early as possible , ideally long before birth.The major predictors include previous incidents of depression , as well as a womans past and current life stresses , like childhood trauma or abuse , conflicts with a partner or family members , lack of social support or coping skills , and poverty .Only about 20 percent to 30 percent of women who experience postpartum depression in the United States get proper treatment , and for low-income mothers , the rate is considerably lower , says Robert T. Ammerman , a professor of pediatrics at Cincinnati Childrens Hospital Medical Center who is the scientific director of Every Child Succeeds , a home visiting program for vulnerable first-time mothers .The consequences for both mother and child can be devastating . If left untreated , postpartum depression can develop into severe clinical depression . In addition to feeling listless , anxious , guilty , lonely and frequently suicidal , mothers who are clinically depressed in pregnancy are three to four times more likely to have a premature delivery or deliver a low-birth-weight baby ( both predictors of serious developmental and medical problems for the child ) and , just as urgent , less likely to form healthy attachments with their children . Their children are more likely to have attention deficits , difficulties controlling their emotions and behavior , language delays and lower I.Q.s  and they are themselves at increased risk of becoming depressed later in life ( PDF ) .We have this idea that during motherhood struggling with emotional issues is normal ,  Ammerman says . The message that a lot of moms hear from families and friends and even professionals who may not know much about perinatal depression is be tough and fight your way through it  and they dont seek help.Ammerman says that while its true that many mothers have or develop depression , its not a normal or typical response to the challenges of parenting . There are effective treatments . They include medication as well as a range of therapies  like cognitive behavioral therapy ( C.B.T . ) , which helps people learn how to counter negative thoughts and their associated emotions , and interpersonal psychotherapy ( I.P.T . ) , which focuses on improving the quality of personal relationships and the satisfaction that is gained from them . About a third of women who get treated for chronic or recurrent depression achieve remission , and more than half see an improvement in their symptoms .Today , several states , including Illinois , New Jersey , West Virginia and Washington , have initiated mandatory screening for perinatal depression ( something that is done nationally in Australia ) . But inadequate screening is only part of the problem . Cost and access barriers and stigmatization  and an overall lack of awareness among health professionals  are what prevent most mothers who need help from getting it . Many primary care doctors fail to recognize when their patients are depressed . And when they do , they often dont know how to provide the most effective treatments . They also cant ensure that patients will follow up with mental health professionals ( many of whom do not accept Medicaid ) . And communication between doctors is notoriously problematic .When people are referred to mental health professionals from primary care settings , the vast majority of the referral slips go into the garbage ,  says Katherine L. Wisner , director of the Asher Center for the Study and Treatment of Depressive Disorders at Northwestern University .Given the scope of the problem , new outreach and treatment models are urgently needed . The three that Im highlighting today are noteworthy because they demonstrate promise and illustrate pathways for potentially broader system changes .The first is a collaborative care model called DAWN being pioneered at two urban obstetrics and gynecology ( ob-gyn ) clinics that are part of the University of Washington system . The innovation here is that mental health care is being integrated directly into ob-gyn care . Why is this such an important idea ? About a third of women in the country see their ob-gyn physicians for their primary care , explains Wayne Katon , vice chair of the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the University of Washington School of Medicine . When depression screening and treatment are handled in the same place as primary care , its more likely that women will get effective help .Through the DAWN program , when a woman comes in for care , she is screened for depression using a standard questionnaire known as PHQ-9 . If her score indicates a likelihood of major depression , she is assigned a care manager who is trained to educate her about depression , explore real or perceived barriers in her life and motivate her to pursue treatment .Its important that treatments are designed to fit with a patients preferences . Theyre given the choice to start with a form of therapy or an antidepressant ,  Katon says . Some say , Im pregnant , Id rather not be on medication. Some want to take medication. They can also choose in-person visits or telephone consultations . Physician-supervised care managers follow up regularly for a year , tracking patients progress . If their symptoms persist , they adjust or increase the intensity of treatment .In two studies published this year , women experienced significant improvements in depressive symptoms . The gains were particularly notable among women who were uninsured or received public insurance , such as Medicaid . The women were more satisfied with the care they got and the ob-gyn doctors were more satisfied because their patients got better ,  Katon adds .The second model was developed by Every Child Succeeds , a home visiting program for vulnerable first-time mothers based out of the Cincinnati Childrens Hospital Medical Center . In recent years , as I have reported in this column , home visiting programs have spread across the country as a result of a $ 1.5 billion appropriation in the Affordable Care Act . This summer , a study of families served by the Nurse-Family Partnership found , remarkably , that the mothers and children assisted by the program had significantly lower death rates over a 20-year period .But home visiting programs have one notable limitation . As recent research indicates , when mothers are clinically depressed , they dont benefit as much from the visits . A mother who is depressed has very little to give her child ,  said Judith B . Van Ginkel , the founder of Every Child Succeeds , which has worked with 22,000 families . We found that half of the mothers we were working with were depressed , and three-quarters had witnessed or been victims of violence.With the leadership of Robert Ammerman and others , Every Child Succeeds has developed a program called Moving Beyond Depression , to train therapists to deliver C.B.T . in conjunction with home visitation .This is how Andrea was able to receive treatment . Shortly after her home visits started , Andrea , who lives just north of Cincinnati and works in a call center , was asked to fill out a questionnaire . ( I have changed her name . ) She learned that she was depressed . I had been in denial ,  she said . For months , conflicts with her mother had been getting worse . Her mother suffered from mental illness and depression , had used drugs , and had long counted on , and expected , Andrea to take care of her .But now Andrea needed every ounce of her strength to care for her baby , and her mother reacted angrily . Over 15 sessions , the therapist helped Andrea develop strategies to manage her feelings and interactions with her mother  rather than being thrown repeatedly to anger , negative thoughts and guilt .Last year , results from a clinical trial funded by the National Institute of Mental Health showed that mothers receiving Moving Beyond Depressions in-home C.B.T . model experienced subtantial improvements in depressive symptoms and decreased diagnosis of major depressive disorder following treatment relative to a control group . The model has spread to several states , including Connecticut , Massachusetts , Kentucky and Kansas , and has been used to assist 600 mothers .The third model grows out of Cindy-Lee Denniss research in Canada , and is important because it illustrates the potential of treating women through interventions over the phone . It thus reduces one of the biggest barriers low-income or rural women face in accessing treatment : transportation to and from treatment and scheduling appointments .In one clinical trial , 700 women in the first two weeks after giving birth , who had been identified as being at a high risk of postpartum depression , were given telephone-based peer support from other mothers  volunteers from the community who had previously experienced and recovered from self-reported postpartum depression ( and received four hours of training ) .We created a support network for the mothers early in the postpartum period ,  Dennis explains . It cut the risk of depression by 50 percent. On average , each mother received just eight contacts  calls or messages , and the calls averaged 14 minutes . Over 80 percent of the mothers said they would recommend this support to a friend .In another clinical trial conducted by Dennis , trained nurses provided interpersonal psychotherapy ( I.P.T . ) over the phone to 240 clinically depressed mothers across Canada . The calls were scheduled at the mothers convenience . The results have not been published yet , but Dennis says the treatment was highly effective . Treatment compliance rates were greater than 85 percent . Dennis is currently working with health officials to pilot test the model in New York City .We underestimate very simple interventions ,  she says . We have this huge bias that face to face is the most effective way to provide care . But we have to be innovative about how we offer help to women.Andrea , who is now 19 , remains grateful for the help she received . I can actually focus on my daughter and be with her the way I want to be with her , and teach her things ,  she says . I feel like now that Ive been through the program  and distanced myself from people I needed to  I can focus on what I need to focus on rather than everybody elses problems .

-1	"Gail Collins : David , I was pretty confident that the United States had Ebola under control until the other day , when it appeared policy-making had devolved to Andrew Cuomo and Chris Christie . Chris Christie , who cant keep bridge traffic moving . Andrew Cuomo , who failed to get his 2012 flu shot until 2013 .David Brooks : This is why were a republic and not a democracy . People running for office should not be making science policy . By the way , Ive been against quarantines and overreaction through this whole thing , but there was a piece in The New Republic a few weeks ago that sobered me . Steven Beutler , an infectious disease specialist , was arguing for a maximalist response . Heres one core point : Medicine can be a very humbling profession , and after more than 30 years of practicing infectious-disease medicine , I have learned that the unanticipated happens all too often , especially where microbes are involved.Gail : Do you think the Ebola hysteria will have any effect on next weeks election ? Theres been a lot of complaint about the administrations ineptitude . But I think the message on Ebola , at least , has been the opposite . Ebola in the United States began deep in the heart of Texas , a state whose health care system is so estranged from the federal government it refuses to accept the opportunity to get its millions of uninsured residents covered under Obamacare .David : Your love of all things Texas is well known . But you have to admit a few things about the place . It is economically vibrant beyond all reckoning . Houston and Dallas are exploding economically while the rest of the country dawdles .Gail : Texas is the last gasp of the Sunbelt boom . It has all the advantages of warm weather , plus an enormous amount of space which makes housing stupendously cheap . It could have done just as well without being politically crazy .But we were talking about Ebola .David : As for Ebola and the election , my pretentious theory is that Ebola is the objective correlative of the campaign .Gail : Youre using big words again .David : If I remember high school English correctly , an objective correlative is an object that gives explicit access to the meaning of vague and insubstantial things , like a mood or an emotion . Its an object that correlates to a mood or emotion or idea . T.S . Eliot made it famous writing about Hamlet .Anyway , the country was already afraid . It felt like the people running things were not quite up to the job . Along comes a disease to perfectly embody that vague sense . That said , I dont think Ebola is swinging too many votes . People are just sour and they are disappointed with the president .Gail : It certainly has been a tough season for President Obama . But before we start blaming him for anything bad that happens next Tuesday , I would like to give him a shout-out for that hug-the-Ebola-nurse photo . Which allows us to recall that when AIDS hit the United States in 1981 , President Ronald Reagan was criminally useless . Never said a word . As Laura Helmuth noted in Slate this week , Reagans press secretary made fun of the idea that the president would ever consider speaking out .David : I totally agree with you on that one . Its not in the presidents job description to be the professional emoter and behavior model , but when he can display some truth by example , he might as well do it .Gail : I know Im preparing my defenses in advance of next week . But I think the American people have been saying they want an effective government , not a smaller government . All the candidates are promising theyre going to end gridlock , but if theres anything weve learned since Obama was elected , its that you dont end gridlock by sending more Tea Party types to Washington .David : I guess I think it is more generalized than that . They just dont trust government to get the job done . At least the federal government . Im struck by how amazingly stable polling has been on the Affordable Care Act . Democrats in swing states dont try to defend it . They just promise to fix it . The relatively good news on the health care front over the past year has done nothing to change minds .Gail : I find it sort of fascinating that the Republican Senate nominee in Iowa , who previously said shed support a law to have federal officials arrested for attempting to implement Obamacare , is marketing herself as the Iowa nice candidate who can work across the aisle .David : I find it shocking that Iowans should steal Minnesotas slogan . Minnesota is the nice state . Missouri is the skeptical state . New Jersey is the brash state . Iowa should be the quiet state .In her defense I think it is possible to arrest federal officials nicely . We call it compassionate conservatism .Gail : O.K. , this is the point at which were morally obliged to start making predictions . Whats yours ?David : I say this with no great confidence , but Im guessing the Republicans pick up eight seats . I think the biggest surprise will be a G.O.P . win in Georgia .Gail : That would make me sad , if only because Michelle Nunn has run such a good race and her opponent has been so terrible . It just seems unjust .My guess is that were not going to know who gets control of the Senate for a while . Some state is going to be so close therell be a recount . And Alaska takes forever to just get the ballots together . Plus Georgia and Louisiana , which will probably go to runoffs , since they require their senators to get a majority of the vote .David : Great ! Why shouldnt the decades most content-less campaign go into overtime ? Im sort of amazed that this election hasnt been about jobs and the economy . It hasnt been about anything but a sort of fatalism .Gail : Theres something about the idea of the fate of the nation hanging on Louisiana that makes me very nervous . I still remember being down there in 1991 , covering the gubernatorial runoff between the Ku Klux Klan wizard David Duke and the deeply corrupt ex-governor Edwin Edwards . The Edwards supporters had those bumper stickers saying : Vote for the Crook. Which , blessedly , the people did .David : Ill take an effective crook over an ineffective honest person any day .Gail : I should mention that at age 87 , Edwards is running for the House of Representatives this year . After getting out of jail , marrying a woman 51 years younger , and starring in a reality TV series . You cant say Louisiana isnt interesting . And if theres a runoff at least then wed be able to spend part of the winter in New Orleans . So much better than next year , when well be spending it in Des Moines .David : I was just in New Orleans last week . I love every street in that city except Bourbon Street , which is filled with terrible pizza places , extremely drunk idiots and teenagers mortified to be walking with their parents .Gong there makes me want to reread my favorite political novel of all time , Robert Penn Warrens All the Kings Men. Trollopes Phineas Finn is second .And dont knock Des Moines . Silence is golden .Gail : Whats the state youre following most closely ? I have to admit Kansas is pretty darned fascinating . If the Republicans have to ferry in any more old party stalwarts to shore up Senator Pat Roberts , theyll be resurrecting Alf Landon .I got a twinge watching Bob Dole campaign so vigorously for Roberts . Do you remember in 2012 when Dole was sitting in the Senate , in his wheelchair , watching his friends refuse to ratify the United Nations treaty on people with disabilities ? Which was based , of course , on the signature bill Dole got passed in 1990 when he was in the Senate .David : Somebody should please explain to me why senators dont ever want to retire . Whats fun about attending Ag Committee hearings when you are 84 ? Maybe the napping opportunities .Gail : I talked with Dole after the treaty vote , and he kept coming back to the fact that both of the Republican Senators from Kansas had voted against ratification . But theres Roberts now , in a deep ditch because he took his constituents so much for granted he didnt even bother to pretend he lived in their state . Dole clearly has a much deeper sense of loyalty .David : I once went to the Dole center in Kansas . Theyve got a sort of museum display about his life . The thing that moved me most was the exercise equipment he used to build himself back into shape after his war injury . He had wasted away to nothing and had to build himself all the way back . Then I got to see the basement where they keep all the presents he had been given by foreign dignitaries during his Senate years . There were carpets , saddles , baseball bats . People give politicians portraits of themselves . I guess thats called knowing your subject .Gail : Its interesting how many elections there are this year where voters seem to despise both candidates . If Floridians were any more alienated by their governors race , theyd have been bringing alligators to the debates .David : I dont think Floridians should be angry or alienated . It doesnt suit them . Among other things , it doesnt go with their pastels .Gail : I dont want anybody to imagine that Im making fun of other states because of my deep satisfaction with New York . Nothing is more humbling than spending a season covering New York politics . Where the phrase not yet indicted is regarded as a compliment .David : If Minnesota is nice and Iowa is quiet , what should New York be : Pompous ? Narcissistic ? I say this lovingly . It is my state too .Gail : Last question . Is there anything about this election thats really surprised you ? I didnt expect to see so much of Mitt Romney on the campaign trail . Do you think hes actually interested in running again ? They say third times a charm .David : Trust me . He isnt running . I think his wife sort of ruled that out . That documentary released after the election revealed him to be an authentically warm and nice guy . If there are three things that dont seem to work in politics these days its authenticity , niceness and warmth . Doesnt fit the national mood ."
-1	"MY trainer , a 31-year-old black man , doesnt vote . It doesnt make any difference which party wins , he says . He doesnt believe that President Obama is really in charge .I respect my trainer . An injury last year ended his professional boxing career . He sometimes works 12-hour days , exhorting client after client . He and his girlfriend have a 3-year-old daughter ; he is supporting his girlfriend while she earns a masters degree . He himself did not go to college , but he got off the Harlem streets . He says that he saved himself from the players life of his father , who is younger than I am .His ambition , his sheer work ethic , make it disheartening for me to hear him say that the Illuminati , or the Trilateral Commission , or some secret council of white men straight out of Ishmael Reeds early satires , control our destinies . This is the kind of thing black nationalists used to say in the 1970s , when they argued that to join the system was to fall for the white mans con . To hear my young trainer give voice to such fatalism tells me how easily black people can lose faith in the democratic process , become disaffected , alienated , in spite of the amazing fact that there is a black man in the White House .Nearly 50 years before Mr. Obama was first elected , the Rev . Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said that racist whites were not the only obstacles to the black vote . Black people had to overcome the intimidation and fear they had internalized after centuries of slavery and decades of Jim Crow . The black vote increased significantly after passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965 . Civil rights organizations took an active role in the education of black voters , teaching them how to be comfortable with the exercise of the franchise . Black candidates won mayoral and congressional elections in the early 1970s , when the black population was concentrated in major cities . In the 1980s , black voters in the Democratic primaries made Jesse L. Jackson Sr.s presidential bids more than symbolic . In the days of the Reagan and Bush backlashes , black candidates needed to have broad appeal , but the coalitions that elected Carol Moseley Braun a senator from Illinois , in 1992 , Deval L. Patrick the governor of Massachusetts , in 2006 , and Mr. Obama a senator , also from Illinois , in 2004 , and then president , in 2008 , had the black vote at their cores .Black turnout outstripped white turnout in 2012 , when Mr. Obama won every major demographic group  except white men . As the political scientist Martin L. Kilson notes in his recent book , Transformation of the African American Intelligentsia , 1880-2012 ,  Mr. Obama stands at the apex of an African-American political class comprising 10,000 elected black officeholders in cities , counties and state legislatures , 43 members of the United States Congress , a black attorney general , a black national security adviser , black secretaries of homeland security and transportation , a black deputy White House chief of staff for policy , and other black policy makers and administrators . Yet  as Mr. Obamas critics on the left point out  conditions for black people over all have sunk back to what they had been around the time of Dr. Kings assassination : more than a third of black children are born into poverty ; there are more black men in the criminal justice system than there are black men in college ; the median income of blacks has fallen ; unemployment among blacks remains higher than the national average . As the former New York Times columnist Bob Herbert said , We know all this , but no one seems to know how to turn things around.An Okinawan-Japanese high school classmate of the presidents explained to me after the first inaugural that in Hawaii everyone is a mongrel , and where you come from doesnt matter . But once the young Mr. Obama went to Los Angeles for college , and was treated as a black youth by the police , he understood what his brave white mother had made him learn during all those mornings of reading black history before school in Indonesia .Some people want to say that Mr. Obama somehow isnt with blacks , because he does not descend from people who were enslaved . He is the son of an immigrant  a Kenyan graduate student who was just passing through . Those who say that that somehow makes him different , or less black , dont know enough about the violence and oppression of colonialism . Class doesnt determine how black people feel about Mr. Obama . Who supports him in black America and who doesnt is largely a generational question . Just as my father was jealous of and ambivalent about Mr. Obama , because Mr. Obama had achieved something that blacks of the G.I . Bill generation had not thought possible , so young black people like my trainer miss in the president the performance and tone that historical footage of the civil rights era has subtly led them to expect of black leaders  an impassioned challenger of the system , someone coming from the outside .I am 60 years old  how did that happen ?  and to me , what Mr. Obama has accomplished is far from insignificant : He saved us from economic meltdown , he got us out of Iraq and Afghanistan , and he signed the Affordable Care Act . He would perhaps be the first to admit we still have far to go . Because I am an old head now , I can accept incremental change , even value it . I voted for him , though I know he is more of a capitalist than I am . I voted for him twice , though in my heart I can not forgive him for turning to economics advisers like Lawrence H. Summers ( whom I despise ) . And I am dismayed by those who are obsessed by the mysteries of Mr. Obamas personality , by his distance , his opacity . Nobody can make him lose his cool , just as nobody can move him from the center . So long as he occupies the middle ground as president , the Republicans are forced to stay on the right . Most of the world is relieved that the president of the United States is a man of integrity and intelligence . But here he is described as a flawed politician , a man not cut out for trench warfare , not the man for our historical moment . His early notion that the country could reconcile in him because of his personal story is dismissed as nave .Mr. Obama is criticized for not having done more for black people  not because they are black people , but because they are among his partys most loyal supporters . Yet many whites resent or are afraid of those moments when the president seems to be taking the black side , speaking from the black point of view . Black people in turn can be frustrated that the black point of view is always ghettoized , never allowed to be , simply , the American point of view  especially when the issue at hand is about social justice . Historically , blacks have looked to the federal government for protection against the doctrine of states rights , a euphemism for the reactionary in American politics . But Mr. Obamas experience in office has shown blacks the limits of executive power .All my adult life , the argument in black America concerning electoral politics has been about trusting the system , wondering if trying to be a part of the mainstream was possible or worth it . To join the larger society involves a loss , the sacrifice of authentic blackness , some black people would say . Throughout black American history , white people have demanded that black people prove their readiness to become full citizens , which is why I really dont like it when President Obama or Bill Cosby chastises blacks for their behavior . As James Baldwin so often said : He wasnt the problem , white people were the problem . There are white Americans who can not forgive him for having won . They cant handle the fact that a black man is in charge of the money , of so much patronage and power . Black people didnt shut down the government ; white people did . To such whites , its a matter of ownership , not partnership .If who wins doesnt matter , then Republicans on the right would not be trying to suppress the black vote . They , too , have heard what the demographics promise . Single mothers now account for a third of eligible voters ; most newborns are members of a minority group . Republicans have gerrymandered districts so that they can win the House without the Latino vote , and districts have also been redrawn so as to reduce the impact of the black vote either by spreading it around or confining it . Conservative opposition to inclusive democracy has not changed in substance since the immigrant vote was routinely suppressed , along with the black vote , in the late 19th century , back when voter registration days in New York could just so happen to fall on Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur ( as I learned from the historian Alexander Keyssar ) . The vote , power elites contended , was a privilege , not a right . Distrust of direct democracy is as much an American tradition as the quest for freedom .The shooting in Ferguson , Mo. , did not leave the news , because demonstrators stayed in the streets , just as Occupy Wall Street movement brought up the urgent matter of wage and wealth inequality and has not let the subject go . Maybe we are at the beginning of another age of activism on the part of youth . In Europe , disaffection from the major political parties has benefited far-right politicians . In America , the rabid Tea Party is the beneficiary . Mr. Obama said somewhere that troublemakers were catalysts for positive change , while others were caretakers of that change . History will remember him as the calm president who steered the nation through dangerous waters ."

Then he was asked what hes for  and he went on to describe Obamacare . Ive always felt that people should either get some type of health care options , or pay for it with a nice competitive fee ,  he said . Thats all great . I believe it in my heart . In terms of preexisting conditions , catastrophic coverages , covering kids , whatever we want to do. He even said it could include the Medicaid expansion [ for ] folks who need that care and coverage.Oh , he also promises his plan wont raise taxes , cut spending on Medicare , or make people drive very far to go to the hospital . So his plan will have more generous insurance options and no way to pay for them . In other words , his plan will be like Obamacare , but even better ! Call it Fauxbamacare ."
-1	"WHO is a person ? How do you qualify for basic human rights ? What is required for you to be able to speak or worship freely or to be free from torture ?Throughout American history , the Supreme Court has considered and reconsidered the criteria for membership in the club of rights , oscillating between a vision limiting rights to preferred groups and another granting rights to all who require protection . These competing visions have led to some strange results .Corporations ( as well as unions ) can spend on political speech to further their group interests as though they were individual political actors . Corporations can assert religious rights to gain legal exemptions from laws that would otherwise apply to them . Muslim detainees at Guantnamo Bay , however , have none of these rights .As a corporate litigator who has also spent more than a decade defending Guantnamo detainees , I have been trying to figure out why corporations are worthy of court protection and Muslims held in indefinite detention without trial by the United States at a naval base in Cuba are not .The direction of the Supreme Court under Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. over the past decade has been anything but consistent . As the court readies itself for another term , it may not be possible to speak of a Roberts court jurisprudence at all . Even within the conservative and liberal blocs there are a range of views on the limits of executive power , the relationship between the federal government and the states , the protection of politically expressive speech and the applicability of the Constitution abroad . But the bulk of the most controversial cases come down to 4-to-4 bloc voting , with Justice Anthony M. Kennedys worldview defining the courts path .But we are not completely in the dark about who is likely to be granted legally enforceable rights and who is not . This term the court will consider whether Arkansas can force a Muslim prisoner to shave his beard , whether a Muslim woman who wears a head scarf can get a job at Abercrombie & Fitch , and whether Alabama can cram African-American voters into a few districts to dilute their political impact .The Roberts court has already charted a course in which rights are extended to those who have real clout in American society and denied to those who are more marginal . In two critical cases , Citizens United and Hobby Lobby , the court decided by a 5-to-4 vote that corporations had broad rights of speech and of religion , which left corporate owners in a position to trumpet their political and religious views while diminishing or even silencing other voices .In Citizens United , the court held that corporations had the right under the First Amendment to spend unlimited amounts on election advertising . The court evaded the issue of whether corporations were legal persons with rights , finding that the political process was always improved by more speech rather than less . Justice Kennedy , writing for the court , found that corporate spending contributed to the dissemination of information and ideas that the First Amendment seeks to foster. He rejected the argument that corporations should be limited simply because such associations are not natural persons. But Congress limits speech all the time . Foreign nationals , for example , even those who live legally in the United States , are not permitted to make campaign contributions or expenditures . They may be persons ,  but for First Amendment purposes , they are not legitimate speakers . Unless , of course , they own shares in corporations .The Supreme Courts decision said nothing about the interests of the corporation or the identity of its stakeholders . Chinese or Russian shareholders could gain control of an American corporation and use shareholder funds to influence elections in the United States . According to the court , money is speech , and once it is corporate money , it is laundered of its foreign taint .In Hobby Lobby , the court considered whether corporations had the right to deprive employees of contraceptive coverage required under the Affordable Care Act , based on the religious objections of their controlling shareholders . The court applied the Dictionary Act , an obscure statute from 1871 that says that a reference in a given statute to a person includes corporations unless the context indicates otherwise. Normal dictionaries do not define persons to include corporations . Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr.s opinion takes a just folks view of the matter : A corporation is simply a form of organization used by human beings to achieve desired ends.This inability to make the distinction between individual corporate stakeholders and the legal fiction of the corporation is not only weird , it is bad corporate law . Whatever else corporations may be , they are not the sum of their people . In her dissent , Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg cited Chief Justice John Marshalls two-centuries-old observation that a corporation is an artificial being , invisible , intangible and existing only in contemplation of law.The modern corporation is a brilliant invention of 19th-century capitalism that creates a separate entity  a legal person  that can enter into contracts , borrow money , sue and be sued without exposing its shareholders to personal liability . The shareholders are not the corporation ; directors , executives and employees arent either . Shareholders , executives and employees do have religious rights  as individuals . Hobby Lobby does not expand anyones religious rights . What it does do is allow the religious beliefs of the owners of a company to trump the beliefs of its employees .The Supreme Court did not declare Hobby Lobby a person with religious rights because it was confused about whether a corporation could pray or have a bar mitzvah . The court chose to allow business owners to retain the powerful protection of limited liability while awarding them the further benefit of an exemption from the financial obligations of the Affordable Care Act . The majority took one definition of a legal person and used it as a hook to impose its own views about the importance of religion and business in American public life . When she was asked recently which court decision during her tenure would be most significant 50 years from now , Justice Ginsburg noted the strangeness inherent in the courts reasoning : Well ,  she said , I think 50 years from now , people will not be able to understand Hobby Lobby.IN holding that corporations had religious rights , the Hobby Lobby decision sat in contrast to a case I brought under the same statute in 2004 , in which the court found that Muslims at Guantnamo Bay were not persons and had no religious rights .That case , Rasul v. Rumsfeld , alleged that Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and the chain of command had established a regime at Guantnamo that systematically humiliated and abused detainees when they tried to practice their religion . In an attempt to break these people , guards threw Qurans in the toilet bucket , blasted rock music to interrupt prayers and forced prisoners to pray with their genitals exposed .To me , the case seemed open-and-shut . The Religious Freedom Restoration Act ( R.F.R.A . ) , which was passed in 1993 , prohibits the government from substantially burdening a persons exercise of religion unless it serves some important government interest that can not be accomplished in any other way . My clients were persons ; throwing Qurans in the toilet bucket certainly made it difficult for them to worship ; and it served no governmental interest to humiliate people who were praying .The Federal District Court in Washington , which first heard the case , agreed that R.F.R.A . expressly protects the religious exercise of persons ,  a broadly applicable term , commonly including aliens. But the government appealed and the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that , as aliens held outside the United States , these men were not persons after all . The Bush administration had put them offshore precisely to ensure this .Even the arch-conservative Judge Janice Rogers Brown , who once said that in the heyday of liberal democracy , all roads lead to slavery ,  was uncomfortable , noting in concurrence , It leaves us with the unfortunate and quite dubious distinction of being the only court to declare those held at Guantnamo are not persons. This is a most regrettable holding in a case where plaintiffs have alleged high-level U.S. government officials treated them as less than human.The case went to the Supreme Court twice . The first time the court ordered the court of appeals to reconsider the case , which it duly did , reaching the same conclusion . The second time the Supreme Court declined to hear the case and the appeals court decision remains the law .So while Muslims in United States custody do not have redress from the coarsest attacks on their religious dignity , corporations do have religious rights that the law protects . Why were my clients , undeniably actual people , abused when they worshiped , while state-chartered artificial entities were allowed an exemption from the law in deference to the religious beliefs of their shareholders ?One possibility is that detainees are excluded because they are aliens outside the United States . But the Supreme Court held in 2008 in Boumediene v. Bush , again with a 5-to-4 vote , that detainees at Guantnamo did have the constitutional right to habeas corpus . To rule otherwise , Justice Kennedy wrote , would be to hold that the political branches have the power to switch the Constitution on or off at will based on where the executive has chosen to bring prisoners . Under this reasoning , the Constitution should be a backpack that travels with governmental authority and protects those subject to American custody .Justice Antonin Scalia was apoplectic . Warning of disastrous consequences ,  he wrote in dissent that today , for the first time in our nations history , the court confers a constitutional right to habeas corpus on alien enemies detained abroad by our military forces in the course of an ongoing war. His dire prediction : It will almost certainly cause more Americans to be killed.He need not have worried . As Judge Laurence H. Silberman , a mainstay of the conservative D.C . Circuit , wrote in a concurrence in 2011 , Boumediene was a charade ,  a defiant  if only theoretical  assertion of judicial supremacy. The courts refused to extend habeas or any other rights to detainees at bases other than Guantnamo . No detainee has ever been released as a direct result of an American court order . As a practical matter , aliens in American custody outside the United States have no enforceable rights . President Obama has forbidden torture by executive order . Yet his predecessor allowed torture , and so could his successor . Whatever else may go into the knapsacks of military personnel , the Constitution is not on the packing list .As the Roberts court begins its 10th term , there is a clear shift away from decades of jurisprudence in which the court envisioned its role as protector of the essential human dignity of those who lacked the political power to protect themselves . Justice William J. Brennan Jr. called the Constitution a sublime oration on the dignity of man. But historically the Supreme Court had ignored the dignity of a broad section of humanity : Native Americans , slaves , women , racial minorities , aliens , Japanese internees , gays and lesbians , and now Muslims at Guantnamo .The current court is solicitous of those who pool their capital and obtain the protection of the corporate form . It is sympathetic toward the interests of mainstream elites , expanding religion , protecting commercial wealth and even protecting gay rights , an issue that crosses class lines . The dignity of prisoners , employees , or ethnic and racial minorities is far less likely to engage the moral imagination of this court .Years ago , my constitutional law professor , Judge Robert H. Bork , taught us about the cases that challenged the government edict that ordered the rounding up of citizens of Japanese ancestry into remote internment camps during World War II . The Supreme Court upheld that order by a vote of 6 to 3 , finding that the military urgency of the situation demanded that all citizens of Japanese ancestry be segregated from the West Coast. Judge Bork was no progressive , but he told us that he was shocked that we the people could so easily succumb to racist , nativist hysteria . Surely it could never happen again .It takes courage for the Supreme Court to stand up for the powerless and the despised . Sometimes it has risen to the challenge and sometimes it has not . With the Roberts court , what we see is a self-referential worldview , which leads the court to enhance the rights of insiders and deny protection to outsiders . On Monday , the justices will begin another term with the question of whether their commitment to the protection of human dignity will be universal or limited to persons just like them ."
-1	"Conservatives appear to be really upset that liberals are actually taking on the facts in the anti-Obamacare ads theyve been running . How dare you question whether the people in these ads are giving an accurate picture  theyre suffering !OK , weve seen this kind of play before . Remember how anyone suggesting that Dick Cheney and whatshisname misled us into invading Iraq was attacking Americans brave fighting men and women ?But theres a different kind of struggle anyone trying to point out the facts encounters  a barrage of anecdotes . You say that the Obamacare horror stories are fake , but I kind of know this man who is being told that he has to buy a policy he cant possibly afford / I read this sad story in the Wall Street Journal / I heard this tale on the radio / etc..How do you answer that ?Well , it cant be done retail . If the Koch brothers are pouring money into ads featuring a person , or the GOP response to the SOTU tells a story , then its worth trying to track down the particulars of this case . But to deal with the broader problem of anecdotes , what you need is a framework that tells you which anecdotes are almost surely wrong .So heres what you need to understand . The Affordable Care Act isnt magic  it produces losers as well as winners . But its not black magic either , turning everyone into a loser . What the Act does is in effect to increase the burden on fortunate people  the healthy and wealthy  to lift some burdens on the less fortunate : people with chronic illnesses or other preexisting conditions , low-income workers .Suppose , then , that someone comes to you with an anecdote about a cancer patient , or just an older person in poor health , and tells you that this person is about to lose the care she needs , or face a huge increase in expenses , under Obamacare . Well , its almost certainly not true  people like that are overwhelmingly beneficiaries of health reform , thanks to community rating , which means that they cant be discriminated against because of their condition .Or suppose that someone tells you about a struggling worker who had adequate coverage but is now being confronted with unaffordable premiums . You should immediately ask , what about the subsidies ? Because the Affordable Care Act has subsidies that are there specifically to keep premiums affordable for lower earners .If someone insists that he knows about someone in these categories who really is being grievously hurt , well , the burden of proof rests with the claimant . Basically , stories like that are going to be very rare .Obamacare opponents could , of course , go with the real losers  people in the one percent paying higher taxes , healthy young men who are getting by with cheap , minimalist policies . But they want sob stories  the sick middle-aged woman facing tragedy . And so far , every single one of those sob stories has turned out to be false  because the very nature of the reform is such that such things hardly ever happen ."
-1	"Until just the other day , Obamacare was a total disaster ; no way would it meet its first-year enrollment targets , or come anywhere close .Now the opponents have retreated to their next line of defense : OK , people are signing up , but only because their existing policies were cancelled , so the program isnt actually reducing the number of uninsured .Oops:Furthermore:These early estimates understate the full effects of the Affordable Care Act on the uninsured for two major reasons . First , the survey does not capture the enrollment surge that occurred at the end of the open enrollment period , because 80 percent of the responses to the March 2014 HRMS were provided by March 6 , 2014 . Second , these estimates do not reflect the effects of some important ACA provisions ( such as the ability to keep dependents on health plans until age 26 and early state Medicaid expansions ) that were implemented before 2013 .Remember , this is just the first year . It has been assumed all along that it would take several years for the word to spread , and the law to have its full effect ."

-1	"A recent paper ( pdf ) by Martin Gilens and Benjamin Page is getting a lot of attention , and deservedly so . Gilens and Page look at a number of issues over the past 30+ years where polling data let us identify public policy preferences , which can be compared with elite and interest-group preferences . And what they find is that politicians dont seem to care very much about what the public thinks : when elite preferences and popular preferences are different , the elite almost always wins .This is an important insight  and it gains special force these days , when the elites views not only favor the elite versus the rest ( duh ) but have also been systematically wrong , on issues from invading Iraq to giving deficits a higher priority than jobs .But there is a danger here of going too far , and imagining that electoral politics is irrelevant . Why bother getting involved in campaigns , when the oligarchy rules whichever party is in power ?So its worth pointing out it does make a difference . Yes , Democrats pay a lot of attention to plutocrats , and even make a point of inviting Patrimonial Capitalism : The Next Generation to White House galas ( I would have missed that , even though its in my own paper , but for Kathleen Geier . Thanks ! ) . But its quite wrong to say that the parties behavior in office is the same . As Floyd Norris points out , Obama has in fact significantly raised taxes on very high incomes , largely through special surcharges included in the Affordable Care Act ; and what the Act does with the extra revenue is expand Medicaid and provide subsidies on the exchanges , both means-tested programs whose beneficiaries tend to be mainly lower-income adults . The net effect will be significant losses for the super-elite  not crippling losses , to be sure , and hardly anything that will affect their elite status  and major gains to tens of millions of less fortunate Americans .If youre waiting for a revolution , or even a new New Deal , this may seem disappointing . But it matters a lot all the same ."
-1	"EARLIER this month , the New York State Legislature passed a bill granting nurse practitioners the right to provide primary care without physician oversight . New York joins 16 other states and the District of Columbia in awarding such autonomy . ( Most states still require nurse practitioners to work with physicians under a written practice agreement . ) The bills authors contend that mandatory collaboration with a physician no longer serves a clinical purpose and reduces much-needed access to primary care .Support for such measures has been widespread . Four years ago the Institute of Medicine called for dropping regulations that prevented nurses from practicing to the full extent of their education and training. Last year the president of the American Association of Nurse Practitioners argued that the current diversity of health professionals rendered hierarchical , physician-centric structures unnecessary.As a physician , I couldnt disagree more . Though well intentioned , such proposals underestimate the clinical importance of physicians expertise and overestimate the cost-effectiveness of nurse practitioners .The impetus behind the new law , which will take effect next year , is the dire shortage of primary-care physicians . A big reason for this scarcity is money . Primary care pays the least of all the medical specialties , and interest in it is at a record low among medical students and residents . At the same time , as baby boomers are starting to retire and the Affordable Care Act adds millions to the rolls of the newly insured , the need for primary-care physicians is growing .Nurse practitioners have been promoted as a cost-effective way to meet this need . Medicare currently reimburses nurse practitioners only 85 percent of the amount that it reimburses primary-care physicians . Paying less for the same work would appear to be a way to save health care dollars .But are nurse practitioners actually more cost-effective ? There is a dearth of good recent empirical research on this question , but some studies have suggested that the answer is no . Nurse practitioners , though generally praised for being sensitive to patients psychological and social concerns , appear to order more diagnostic tests than do their physician counterparts . In one study , published in 1999 in the journal Effective Clinical Practice , primary-care patients assigned to nurse practitioners underwent more ultrasounds , CT scans and M.R.I . scans than did patients assigned to physicians . The nurse practitioners patients also had 25 percent more specialty visits and 41 percent more hospital admissions .These differences are costly . According to the study , they may offset or negate any cost savings achieved by hiring nurse practitioners in place of physicians.There are many reasons the nurse practitioners may have ordered more tests and expert consultations . But it seems most plausible that they did so to compensate for a lack of training . Nurse practitioners receive approximately 600 hours of clinical instruction during their entire formal education , which is less than physicians receive in just the first year of a three-year medical residency .Medical school graduates , after two years of classroom instruction and two years of clinical training , are not considered fit to practice medicine independently . Yet in New York State next year , nurse practitioners with perhaps even less clinical education will be allowed to do so .This does not seem fair or wise . I dont want to see a two-tiered system of primary care develop in this country . Though primary care is often focused on relatively straightforward illness prevention and health promotion , there will always be subtleties and complexities that demand a doctors judgment .When I was doing my internship , 15 years ago , a fellow intern told me about a patient she had seen in the clinic whose voice was hoarse . She had no idea what was wrong with him , but her primary-care instructor , on a routine pass by , immediately diagnosed goiter , an enlargement of the thyroid gland . You have to know too much to do primary care ,  she concluded . ( She ended up specializing in cardiology . )Primary care , though often routine , is also about finding the extraordinary in what may appear to be routine . As a doctor recently wrote on Sermo , a physician online community , Its the ability to differentiate those pale shades of gray in patient care that counts. To do so consistently , I believe , requires a doctors expertise .So if we want more primary-care providers , lets have them be doctors . And to attract more of the best and brightest in our medical schools , lets find a way to increase their pay . There is an essential place for nurse practitioners in medicine , but it is as part of a physician-led team . Nurse practitioners are worthy professionals and are absolutely essential to patient care . But they are not doctors ."
-1	"The current state of public opinion on health reform is really peculiar . If youve been following the issue at all closely , you know that the Affordable Care Act is one of the great comeback stories of public policy : after a terrible start , it has dramatically exceeded expectations . But hardly anyone seems to know that .Its easy to understand how that happens for Fox-watchers and Rush-listeners , who are fed a steady diet of supposed Obamacare disaster stories . Remember this ?But the real story hasnt even gotten through to many people who should know better .Over the weekend I had dinner in NYC with some very smart , sophisticated people ; yes , all of them liberals . And almost everyone in the group was under the impression that Obamacare is still going badly  they wanted me to tell them whether it could still be turned around .Meanwhile , New York ( which created its own exchange ) is a huge success story : enrollment is 60 percent higher than federal projections , premiums have been cut in half .An aside : New York was already a community-rating state , where insurers werent allowed to discriminate based on medical history . But the result of that system was that healthy people tended to stay out of the individual market , creating a bad risk pool that drove up rates . Now everyone has to be in , dramatically improving the risk pool . As such , the New York experiences demonstrates the essential role of the individual mandate for reform .But anyway , back to the mystery : here we have smart , pro-reform people living in a state where reform is going really well . And they dont know it !In part this may reflect the Obama administrations lackluster job so far in getting the word out . But it also , I think , reflects a persistent anti-ACA tilt in news coverage . In the final days of March I wrote about the de facto blackout on the obvious surge in enrollments ; if you werent reading Charles Gaba and/or bloggers who followed him , you were in the dark about a huge developing story . And this tilt has continued .Just FYI : the article I linked above , about the spectacular success of New York reform , was on page A16 "
-1	"If youve been tracking the news on signups under the Affordable Care Act  which is easy thanks to Charles Gabas invaluable site  you already knew that the program was making a pretty good recovery from the botched start . Now , however , its official : as of the end of January signups were only about a million behind their projected track as of last spring , which means that as of March 31 the total is likely to be 6-point-something million rather than the projected 7 million . In other words , basically OK .But heres the thing : every online article Ive seen about the latest numbers is followed by a huge number of vitriolic comments insisting that it isnt true , that Obamacare is a total disaster . Some commenters declare that all the numbers are lies ; others , getting their take from right-wing bloggers , say that all of those who have signed up but not yet paid their first premium  ahem , 47 percent of the total  will never pay and are fake enrollees . And so on .You cant help but notice the resemblance to the unskewing fever of the final weeks of the 2012 election , when everyone on the right knew , just knew , that the polls showing a clear Obama edge were biased and wrong , and that if you reworked the numbers somehow they pointed to a Romney triumph .Now , you might ask , how do I know that the Obamacare unskewers are wrong ? Actually , I dont know that for sure  but its very unlikely that theyre right . For one thing , they are more or less the same as the poll unskewers  people who know nothing about the subject , but know what they want to believe . For another , CBO  which has a reputation to defend  thinks its going to be OK . Finally , the insurers , who have real money on the line , seem fairly calm , which wouldnt be the case if they saw really terrible enrollment .Two things are interesting about all of this . First , the right has evidently learned nothing from the unskewing debacle . And second , right-wingers are totally vested in the idea of an Obamacare collapse . They have no plan B , and their only answer to growing evidence that its not going to happen is furious denial ."
-1	"The good news for Obamacare just keeps coming in . Via Charles Gaba , the Rand Survey  which was the subject of a report in the LA Times , but which wasnt publicly available  is now in . And it says that as of mid-March  that is , before the final enrollment surge  the Affordable Care Act had already produced a net gain of 9.3 million insured adults . Again , thats a net gain ; so much for claims that more people are losing insurance than gaining it .At least some Republicans are realizing that ( a ) the ACA is not going to collapse and ( b ) they cant simply take away insurance from millions of Americans . So they have to come up with an alternative .And as Sahil Kapur reports , at least a few of them are coming to a terrible realization : there is no alternative . You cant just support the popular pieces of reform , in particular coverage for preexisting conditions , and scrap the rest . As Jonathan Gruber taught me , and I and others have said many times , reform is a three-legged stool that requires community rating , the individual mandate , and subsidies ; take away any leg and it collapses . And Kapur finds a GOP aide who admits to the awful truth : any workable GOP plan would look pretty much the same as Obamacare .I dont know how many GOP leaders , as opposed to aides , understand this . And even those who do wont dare to admit it . The party line , literally , has been that Obamacare is an unworkable monstrosity , and the base will destroy anyone who points out , this late in the game , that its both workable and pretty much the only doable alternative to single-payer .And if thats not a case of politics making people stupid , I dont know what is.."
-1	"LAST week U.S. News and World Report released its annual list of Best Hospitals. Web sites are being updated to celebrate victories . ( Johns Hopkins ranks No . 1 ! ) Magazines will be plump with advertising . ( NewYork-Presbyterian is first in New York and tied for seventh nationally ! ) And , because I am a reporter covering health care , my in-box is accumulating e-mails from the Honor Roll of the Top 18 hospitals .But what does this annual exercise mean for patients ? And what does it say about American health care ?After all , Harvard and Princeton , which tied for No . 1 in the magazines 2013 Top 10 national universities list , didnt take out ads to proclaim their triumph ; they will fill their classrooms no matter . And as in the college ratings , there are no big surprises in the top hospital group : they are the big academic medical centers  the Mayo Clinic , Massachusetts General Hospital , the Cleveland Clinic . More to the point , even though you might well fly across the country for four years of schooling , you are far more likely to stay near your home for medical care. No ones flying to Mayo in Minnesota to get inhalers for asthma , even though it ranks No . 1 for pulmonary medicine .But American hospitals are a bit like restaurants , competing for your business ( and donations ) . As such they go all out to promote their brand , even though hospitals and doctors are not permitted to advertise in many other countries .For American hospitals large and small , it clearly pays to advertise , particularly in these tough economic times and with the Affordable Care Act poised to throw tens of millions of newly insured patients into the market . But for patients the rankings and , especially , the subsequent promotions generally have limited benefit , experts say .Nearly every hospital has a banner out front saying theyre a top hospital for something in some rating system ,  said Dr. Nicholas Osborne , a Robert Wood Johnson Clinical Scholar at the University of Michigan . Those ratings have become more important for hospital marketing than for actually helping patients find the best care.Whats more , Dr. Osborne compared the outcomes of two ranking programs  one by U.S. News and World Report and the other by Healthgrades  and found a large discordance in their results . The two biggest rating systems come up with completely different lists ,  he said . What does that tell you ? If such advertising often adds little in the way of useful information , it certainly adds to health care costs . Hospitals with more than 400 beds spent an average of $ 2.18 million on advertising in 2010 , surveys have found .Were pushing $ 3 trillion in health expenditures , and one-third of that is waste ,  said Dr. Eric Topol , chief academic officer at Scripps Health in California . Those TV commercials saying I got my cancer care at X hospital are a shame , definitely wasteful.To be fair , U.S. News cautions that its national ratings reflect how hospitals perform in treating technically challenging cases and that the list is merely a starting point after which patients have to do their own research.But those caveats are lost in the subsequent barrage of advertising . And the magazine encourages hospitals to post its seal of approval . In return , the U.S. News Web site is bursting with hospital advertising .Some critics decry the glut of hospital self-promotion as not just wasteful and costly , but also potentially dangerous .There are general fraud laws , but there is no law specific to hospital advertising , and there should be ,  said Robert Steinbuch , a professor of law at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock , who studies the topic . I cant tell you how many hospitals say , We have state-of-the-art CAT scanners  there is no such thing ! Its an old technology.IN a country where numerous organizations  including Yelp  accredit , rate and rank hospital care , some accolades may indicate excellence and some dont mean that much at all , he added . And while teams of academics and scores of for-profit companies are developing quality metrics to guide health care reform and to help patients shop for their care , it turns out that rating a hospital accurately is extremely complicated . For one thing , hospitals that take on sicker patients might have more complications after surgery .Yet even smaller hospitals tend to advertise their profit-making departments , like cardiology , even though they may not offer the full range of heart services .If they advertise cardiac care and dont have angioplasty , thats essentially fraud ,  Mr. Steinbuch said , adding that if a patient dies , that could be considered criminally negligent homicide.But health care advertising is probably here to stay . Hospital advertising sets up an arms war , so that hospitals feel they cant survive without aggressive marketing ,  said Dr. Topol of Scripps Health .And even skeptics concede that health care ratings , when properly developed and employed , may help hospitals improve their performance and provide patients with valuable information .If you have a rare lung condition that has flummoxed local doctors , for example , you may want to fly to Mayo since U.S. News has ranked it No . 1 in pulmonary medicine . And if a dozen hospitals in your area offer hip replacements , a search of regional rankings on the magazines Web site will yield some useful statistics . But take all those hospital advertisements with a grain of salt .Indeed , with thousands of good hospitals across the nation , the best selling point for routine medical care may simply be convenience : some studies show that patients prefer nearby hospitals with worse results over ones with better outcomes farther away ."
-1	"Jonathan Gruber is mad as hell , and hes not going to take it anymore . The eminent health care economist and health reform architect is annoyed at Casey Mulligans latest , which misrepresents Grubers views ; mine too .Gruber is right to be mad : that was a disgraceful , deceptive column . But I think you also want to put it into a larger picture : the enduring myth of the stupid progressive economist .So about Mulligan : As Gruber documents , he pulls multiple fast ones , asserting things that he says are conclusions of the CBO report when they arent  theyre his own views , pulled out of , um , thin air , or maybe someplace else , which he is projecting onto the budget office to make them seem authoritative .Beyond that , Mulligan tells his readers that both Gruber and I are too dumb or craven to admit that the disincentives to work created by some aspects of the Affordable Care Act impose economic costs . One suspects that Mulligan didnt actually read either of the pieces he links to . If he had , he would have found this from Gruber:But the likelihood of voluntary reductions in work is not the only issue . The CBO also projects work reduction by individuals who cut back on hours or avoid moving up the job ladder because they dont want to lose Medicaid eligibility , or because they dont want to make so much in wages that they would lose tax credits to help pay insurance premiums . Unlike voluntary job leaving , this second kind of work reduction would entail real economic distortions and be a cost , not a benefit .And this from me:Just to be clear , the predicted long-run fall in working hours isnt entirely a good thing . Workers who choose to spend more time with their families will gain , but theyll also impose some burden on the rest of society , for example , by paying less in payroll and income taxes . So there is some cost to Obamacare over and above the insurance subsidies . Any attempt to do the math , however , suggests that were talking about fairly minor costs , not the devastating effects Mr. Cantor asserted in his next post on Twitter .So both of us acknowledge that there are incentive effects and that they have a cost ; but both of us argue on quantitative grounds that the cost isnt large . Hardly the doctrinaire liberalism Mulligan thinks he sees .Oh , and bonus misrepresentation : Mulligan:Paul Krugman goes even further and calls it misrepresentations to interpret the marginal tax rate provisions of the Affordable Care Act as destructive .No , I didnt  I called talk about 2 million jobs destroyed a misrepresentation , because it is . Who says so ? The CBO itself .On to the broader point . What one sees in this particular Mulligan piece is something I encounter all the time , in many contexts : the myth of the stupid progressive economist .It works like this : Conservatives in general , and conservative economists in particular , often have a very narrow vision of what economics is all about  namely supply , demand , and incentives . Anything that interferes with the sacred functioning of markets or reduces the incentive to produce must be a bad thing ; any time a progressive economist supports policies that dont fit neatly into this orthodoxy , it must be because he doesnt understand Econ 101 . And conservative economists are so sure of this that they cant be bothered to actually read what the progressives write  at the first hint of deviation from laissez-faire , they stop paying attention and begin debating with the stupid progressive in their mind , not the real economist out there .As a result , many conservatives seem utterly unable to take on board the notion that people like Jon Gruber or yours truly might understand Econ 101 , but also believe with good reason that you need to go beyond that point .On the health care issue : yes , there are incentive effects  as there are with all insurance , by the way . But theres also good reason to believe that theres a major market imperfection in the form of job lock , and that even aside from this , there are important benefits to expanding health insurance that must be weighed against any costs . All of that is , in brief , in both of the pieces Mulligan denounces , and there at much greater length in our other writings ; but as so often happens , conservatives develop problems of reading comprehension whenever such issues come up .Ive encountered similar responses on many other issues . You say that deficit spending is helpful in a depressed economy ? You must be saying that deficits and bigger government are always good , which is stupid hahaha . You say that increasing unemployment benefits in a demand-constrained economy can create jobs ? But you also said once upon a time that unemployment insurance can raise the natural rate of unemployment , so youre stupid hahaha .Well , somebodys being stupid , anyway .I cant resist going back to the 2009 debate over stimulus , when one after another , prominent conservative economists dismissed calls for a temporary increase in spending as being clearly stupid and/or corrupt , because accounting identities , or maybe the effect of expected future taxes , clearly showed that stimulus made no sense . Along the way these notables reinvented classic conceptual errors from 80 years ago and added a few new howlers too ; yet their faith in the proposition that progressive economists must be idiots never wavered .But then John Stuart Mill knew all about this ."
-1	"Senator Mitch McConnell gave the country a glimpse this week of what Republican control of the Senate would look like . If it produces a familiar depression , its because weve seen what happens when Republican leaders in the House have used the identical tactics , and most people have little interest in seeing Washington return to battle stations .In an interview with Politico , Mr. McConnell , the minority leader , promised to govern through extortion if his party picks up enough seats in November to make him the majority leader come January . He plans to attach provisions to must-pass spending bills that would roll back the administrations policies , and dare President Obama to veto them . Were going to pass spending bills , and theyre going to have a lot of restrictions on the activities of the bureaucracy ,  Mr. McConnell said . Thats something he wont like , but that will be done . I guarantee it.When a spending bill is vetoed , the resulting impasse leads to a shutdown of the affected departments . If no spending bills can pass , the result is a government shutdown like the one that lasted for 16 days last October , after the House tried to dismantle the Affordable Care Act .No one expected Congress to get much done during Mr. Obamas final years , but Mr. McConnell apparently intends to escalate the level of confrontation . By promising to resort once again to the use of extortion  and presumably that would extend to raising the debt ceiling  Mr. McConnell demonstrates that his party lacks positive ideas , and is beholden to its most reactionary elements . Many Republican leaders , including Mr. McConnell himself , seemed to have learned how unpopular the shutdown technique was , and had vowed not to use it again . But the partys base , as best embodied by Senator Ted Cruz of Texas , has become addicted to the very act of confrontation , and wants to engage in showdowns whether or not they are fruitful in political or policy terms .Mr. McConnell , the opposite of a firebrand , needs those kinds of voters in Kentucky to survive his current challenge from the Democrat in his race , Alison Lundergan Grimes . Thats probably why the example he gave in his interview was to add restrictions to the Environmental Protection Agency , which has become unpopular among some voters in the state because of its proposed limits to coal-plant emissions .Even if its just a veneer of toughness for campaign purposes , its the wrong kind of message to send to voters who are weary of seeing Washington on the brink . It raises expectations among extremists , and will embolden other candidates to make the worst kinds of threats . It also sends a clear message to Democratic voters who are thinking of sitting November out . The midterms matter a great deal ."
-1	"President Obama was generous on Thursday in referring to Speaker John Boehners proposed lawsuit against him as a stunt ,  a word generally used to mean a playful attempt to get attention . In fact , the suit is a mean-spirited attempt to deflect attention  specifically from the Houses refusal to engage in the act of governing .For the foreseeable future , there will be no action to boost the economy , or help minimum-wage workers , or extend unemployment insurance , or address climate change . Immigration reform is dead . The most basic appropriations bills are likely to get bogged down in Republican attempts to promote coal burning and rein in the Clean Water Act . There is already talk of another in an endless series of stopgap spending bills , the surest sign of a non-functioning Congress . And the Tea Party would love nothing more than another shutdown fight or even impeachment hearings . Mr. Boehners lawsuit , which he said will challenge the presidents use of executive authority , was designed in part to appease the far-right corner . But more substantively , it is part of Mr. Boehners long-running strategy to pretend there is a legitimate reason for the years of obstruction .He cant very well explain to the public that the real reason there has been no action on immigration reform is because large swaths of the Republican base dislike Hispanic immigrants . And so he had to construct a way to blame Mr. Obama for the inaction .Speaker Boehner has been very clear about this : He wants to fix Americas broken immigration system ,  his spokesman , Michael Steel , said last month . But no one trusts the White House to enforce the law as written. He cant be trusted because he allowed the children of immigrants who came to this country illegally to remain without fear of deportation , an executive action that may be on the list of particulars in the lawsuit . ( Mr. Boehner hasnt said which actions prompted him to sue . )Coal-state lawmakers cant admit they would rather foul the air than hurt the short-term interests of their states biggest industries and employers , so they pretend they are angry about a procedural matter : Mr. Obamas overreach in directing environmental regulators to enforce carbon standards without the permission of Congress .And Republicans care not in the least about the substance of the administrations actions in delaying parts of the Affordable Care Act ; instead they see each administrative action as an opportunity to portray the president as tyrannical . We didnt elect a monarch or a king ,  Mr. Boehner told the House in a letter on Wednesday outlining his legal plans .Royalty is a laughable way to describe a president who had to struggle to get his own aides confirmed by the Senate , and was forced to use an experimental legal maneuver to keep entire agencies functioning . Mr. Obamas attempt to use recess appointments to get around the Republican refusal to confirm any members to the National Labor Relations Board , regardless of qualification , was slapped back by the Supreme Court on Thursday . Republicans immediately claimed the court , too , has become angered by the presidents imperialism , refusing to acknowledge the president had acted out of desperation to get around their own unprecedented level of resistance .Mr. Boehners diversion is the ultimate in frivolous lawsuits  a subject he knows well , since he frequently applies the word frivolous to the lawsuits he doesnt like , including those fighting discrimination against gays and lesbians in the workplace . But it is likely to fail in both its legal objective and its larger purpose . Americans are pretty good at detecting phony excuses to get out of work ."
-1	"CHARLOTTESVILLE , Va .BOTH liberals and conservatives have the American Constitution in the cross hairs . They assault the Constitution in their different ways , each with damaging effects on our nation . Conservatives attack the courts on one hand and seek to have them advance their activist agenda on the other . Liberals , when it suits them , embrace rights that have not been enumerated in the Constitution and cry for restraint only when their pet bills come under fire . The result is a national jurisprudence whetted by political appetite , with our democratic values as the victims .Conservatives increasingly bemoan Congresss power to regulate interstate commerce , as illustrated by the debate over the Affordable Care Acts requirement that individuals buy health insurance . They argue that Congress can only regulate activity , not inactivity , and so when it gets involved in a decision by a consumer to not purchase health care , it is going far beyond its reach .If only it were that simple .As a political argument , that resonates : Dont Tread On Me trumpets the imperishable spirit of American liberty . But as a constitutional argument , it would imbue judges with unprecedented powers to topple an exhaustively debated and duly enacted federal law and to make the determination that the decision not to buy ice cream can be neatly severed from the decision to buy chocolate or vanilla .In curbing federal excess , courts risk lessening our national economic strength . That strength resides partly in the national aspects of our founding document , among them the now maligned commerce clause and the newly mistrusted supremacy clause , which gives preference to federal over state law when there is a conflict . States rights are important in many spheres , but the benefits of a national economic policy must also be considered . A vibrant economic order requires some political predictability , and the prospect of judges striking down commercial regulation on ill-defined and subjective bases is a prescription for economic chaos that the framers , in a simpler time , had the good sense to head off .It is tempting to shout states rights when deeply flawed federal legislation is enacted , but the momentary satisfactions of that exercise carry long-term constitutional costs . Badly conceived bills die a thousand political deaths  in the appropriations process , in the states , through electoral retribution , in the executive appointments of a succeeding administration and ultimately in amendment and repeal . However , if courts read the Constitution in such a way that it enables them to make Congress ineffectual , and instead to promote 50 state regulatory regimes in an era of rapidly mounting global challenges , the risks should escape no one . Making our charter more parochial while other nations flex their economic muscle seems like poor timing .Liberals are mounting their own , equally damaging , assault on the Constitution . They have forsaken the textual and historical foundations of that document in favor of judicially decreed rights of autonomy . It is one thing to value those rights our cherished Bill of Rights sets forth . But to create rights from whole cloth is to turn ones back on law .Just like the opponents of the Affordable Care Act , the proponents of reproductive choice and same-sex marriage have strong arguments  but they are political , not constitutional . What are the consequences when liberals shortchange democratic liberty in favor of judicial expansion of unenumerated personal rights ? Well , for one , creating constitutional rights without foundation frays the community fabric and , with it , the very notion that the majority can enact into law some expression of shared values that make ours a society whose whole is more than the sum of its parts . In pushing a constitutional vision of autonomous individuals divested of location in larger social settings , liberals risk weakening the communal values and institutions that best afford our most disadvantaged the chance for a good life .At a time of dismay over democratic dysfunction , the temptation to ask courts to supplant self-governance runs high . And yet when I look past the present debacle , and think of where democracy has brought this country , I would not lose faith .The risks of continuing our present constitutional course are grave . One faction risks damage to the nation at large , the other to the vital roles of smaller communities . All factions owe their fellow citizens the hope and the prospect of democratic change , not the message that their views have been constitutionally condemned and their opponents views carved in the stone of our founding charter . Restraint has much to commend it as a judicial value , not least of which is that it extends the hand of tolerance and respect to those whose views we may not share , but whose citizenship we do share and whose love of family , community and country burns no less brightly than our own ."
-1	"The Missouri legislature had no trouble passing a big tax cut today over the veto of Gov . Jay Nixon . As a Missouri native , Im probably more irritated by this than most Times readers are , but my state is only one of many that have been sharply pulled to the right in the last few years . Whats happening in Jefferson City is already familiar to residents of Wisconsin , Michigan , Kansas , North Carolina , and many others .The main difference is that Mr. Nixon is a Democrat , a relic of the days when his party dominated the state . But Republican leaders are working on that . Last month , they had a serious debate in the House on whether the governor should be impeached for allowing same-sex married couples to file joint tax returns . Gay and lesbian people cant get married to each other in Missouri , which has a constitutional amendment prohibiting it , but Mr. Nixon had the temerity to allow the joint returns for couples married elsewhere . This is such a blatant and serious violation of Missouris constitution and Missouri law that the governor should be removed from office ,  said Nick Marshall , a state representative from Parkville .In case that didnt work , there was another impeachment resolution filed that would have ousted Mr. Nixon for failing to properly discipline state workers who released a list of concealed gun permits to the federal government . The resolution began , Whereas , the people of the State of Missouri cherish their right to bear arms and went downhill from there .A few weeks ago , the legislature approved a measure that would nullify all federal gun laws and allow residents to sue federal agents for enforcing them . It carries no legal weight , and Mr. Nixon vetoed something similar last year , but the true believers apparently feel the need to re-establish their credentials repeatedly .Although the impeachment efforts were dropped today , Republicans have managed to push through their agenda . As a Kansas City Star editorial noted , todays tax cut doesnt even benefit the people who could use the money the most . A family making $ 44,000 a year will get a $ 32 break , while one making $ 1 million will get $ 7,800 . Most of the benefits , in fact , go to one special-interest group .It is a gift to businesses whose owners declare their business incomes on their personal tax forms ,  the Star wrote . Up to one-fourth of their income could eventually be tax-free if the bill becomes law , whether or not they create jobs.Naturally , Missouri isnt coming close to fully funding its public school and university system , and is one of 20 states that refuses to expand Medicaid , turning down $ 2.2 billion from the federal government because that would mean accepting the reality of the Affordable Care Act . But when businesses raise their voices for a tax cut , they are answered .Its not the state I grew up in , which is exactly the way a new generation of leaders like it ."
-1	"Every year or so Paul Ryan comes up with a glossy new plan to deal with poverty or spending on social programs . The plans never go anywhere , but theyre not really intended to : Theyre designed to make the Republican Party ( and Mr. Ryan himself ) appear more thoughtful than it actually is on these subjects .The one he released today is somewhat better than previous efforts , in that it doesnt propose massive cuts in overall spending ( unlike his House budgets ) , and would even increase the Earned Income Tax Credit , one of the governments most successful anti-poverty programs . Democrats have also embraced a larger credit , although unlike Mr. Ryan , they would pay for it by raising taxes on the rich rather than slashing federal nutrition programs that Mr. Ryan thinks are a waste of money . But the lack of seriousness in the plan is demonstrated by its supposedly big idea : It would combine 11 of the most important federal poverty programs into something called an opportunity grant that would be given to the states to spend as they see fit . The eliminated programs would include food stamps , what remains of the welfare system ( known as Temporary Assistance to Needy Families ) , Section 8 housing vouchers , and low-income heating assistance , among others .This technique should sound familiar . Members of Mr. Ryans party have spent years promoting the idea that states can do things better than Washington . As Rick Santorum repeated endlessly in 2012 , Cap it , cut it , freeze it , and block-grant it to the states. Mr. Ryans running mate that year , Mitt Romney , would have turned all of Medicaid into a block grant system dumped onto the steps of 50 state capitols .Putting programs like food stamps into a block grant means they could not be expanded on a national basis during economic emergencies , when unemployment or poverty soars . If a state were to have a budget crisis , perhaps due to tax cuts , social spending would be the first to go .The broader problem is the sharp division between the states , which exposes the gap between Mr. Ryans attempt at high-mindedness and the petty grievances of the Republican majority . The proponents of these consolidation ideas know that while blue states would shoulder their responsibilities and protect their poorest residents , many red states would not . If Washington were not in the anti-poverty business , Republicans would have an opportunity to reduce spending on social programs in about half the country .The attitude of red states toward social spending has been made brutally clear by their reaction to the Affordable Care Act . In 36 states , lawmakers refused to set up health care exchanges , putting the insurance subsidies for poor people at risk if a recent court decision is upheld . And only 27 states , including the District of Columbia , have agreed to expand their Medicaid programs . The effect on lowering the number of uninsured people in states with expanded programs is clear , but lawmakers elsewhere dont care .In Florida , the Republicans who rule the state have not created exchanges or expanded Medicaid , and have offered nothing to the 760,000 state residents with no insurance . The state has even banned volunteers who were helping poor people sign up for the federal exchange . The president of the Florida Senate , Don Gaetz , summed up the prevailing attitude perfectly this week : As long as I serve in the Senate , I will never support the state of Florida serving as the instrument by which individuals and businesses are forced into a federal mandate to purchase a health insurance product they may not want.Mr. Ryan would never say so , but the real effect of his plan is to turn over a series of highly successful federal poverty programs into the hands of Don Gaetz and other anti-government ideologues . Theres not much doubt what the effect on poor people would be ."
-1	"Much to the chagrin of womens rights advocates , Hobby Lobby has won its legal battle  but claims of victory for religious freedom must be emended . Make no mistake : This is no victory for the freedom to exercise Christian principles . Though employers like Hobby Lobby are now free to deny women access to contraceptives through their employer-subsidized health plans on the basis of religious objection , they will be violating their own purported Christian principles if they do . While Christians are not compelled by their faith to engage in religious practices that impose upon the freedoms of others , they are compelled  by their belief that all persons , men and women , are created in the image of God  to oppose discrimination .Some corporations that have objected to the contraceptive requirements of the Affordable Care Act , like Hobby Lobby , claim that they do not wish to discriminate against women by denying them access to contraceptives generally , and that their opposition is merely to abortion . However , their understanding of which medications act as abortifacients rests on an outdated understanding of medical science and is at odds with the facts of the matter . Use of these contraceptive methods is not tantamount to abortion , and moreover , providing women with access to safe , reliable contraceptives for free drastically reduces the actual abortion rate .It is likely that women will ultimately retain coverage , anyhow , though religious employers are now able to legally withhold it . The Supreme Court assumed in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby that the government has a compelling interest in ensuring that women have full access to preventive care . It appears that a majority of the court believes that this interest is compelling . The issue still under real legal dispute is how that coverage will be provided .One suggestion is that the Obama administration extend to closely held , for-profit corporations the same accommodation already in place for religiously affiliated nonprofits . If a corporation objects , on religious grounds , to covering contraceptives in its health plan , it can fill out a two-page form , with five questions ( two of which are providing a signature and the date ) , self-certifying that it meets the requirements for religious accommodation . By submitting this form , employees will be provided contraceptive coverage directly from their insurance company rather than through their employer .This very exemption , however , currently faces its own legal threat from some Christian religious organizations , which claim that notifying the government of their objections to contraceptive use is itself religiously objectionable , as doing so will trigger the provision of coverage by a third party . The University of Notre Dame and Wheaton College are among several institutions that have brought such challenges . There is very little sense to be made of claims that your freedom of religion is substantially burdened by someone elses providing services that you do not want to provide yourself . This suggests that the legal challenges are not merely aimed at allowing corporations to abstain from facilitating behavior they deem immoral but instead are seeking to effectively prevent women from engaging in that immoral behavior by keeping financial barriers for women , and administrative barriers for the government , in place .This is economic coercion . Opponents to the contraceptive mandate have insisted that women remain free to purchase whatever health care services they choose , but this is woefully insensitive to the reality that low-income women and families face . For these women , there is a very large difference between what is available to them for purchase in principle and in effect . It is easy for those who do not regularly face desperate decisions due to financial insecurity or medical complexities to forget the difference . An intrauterine device , for example , can cost a low-income full-time worker more than a months wages . For some women , this is both the safest and most effective medical option , yet hopelessly unaffordable .This kind of economic coercion is distinctly at odds with Christian principles . There is only one incident described in the Christian scriptures where Jesus is represented as employing coercive force , and it was not used to prevent people from engaging in sin . It was used , instead , to prevent people from dishonoring God by exploiting religious practice for personal gain . The gospels describe Jesus reaction to those who sought to profit from the Passover pilgrimage to the temple as fierce : And making a whip of cords , he drove them all out of the temple , with the sheep and oxen . And he poured out the coins of the money-changers and overturned their tables . And he told those who sold the pigeons , Take these things away ; do not make my Fathers house a house of trade. This is where corporations that claim their operations constitute religious practice of the Christian faith ought to take note .Hobby Lobby offered coverage for some of the contraceptives it now claims its religious faith forbids it to have any association with , until shortly after the Becket Fund for Religious Freedom asked it if it would be interested in filing suit . The company continues to profit from investments in the manufacturers of the objectionable contraceptives through the 401 ( k ) plan it offers its employees . Recently , Hobby Lobby has faced legal trouble for false advertising . It has built a fortune , in large part , by selling goods manufactured in China , infamous for its poor labor conditions and related human rights violations . These are the practices of a corporation that will emphasize the Christian faith of its owners when convenient and profitable , but set that faith aside when it would be costly to do otherwise .Hobby Lobby is not the only corporation which has objected to the law through what seems to be quite selective applications of Christian principle . Offering health care coverage as called for by the Affordable Care Act is morally permissible according to the Catholic philosophical tradition , and the sincerity of institutions like the University of Notre Dame is questionable .The more pressing question religious corporations should ask themselves is whether denying women comprehensive health care while providing it to men , and so failing to respect womens inherent dignity and equality , is consistent with their religious values . Since the Supreme Court focused on the practical effects at stake ( that is , whether women would be able to obtain coverage elsewhere , and thus by a less restrictive means ) rather than on the expressive function of the law , Hobby Lobby is now free to discriminate in its provision of health care . But the question remains , why would it want to ?Kathryn Pogin will enter the graduate program in philosophy at Northwestern University in the fall ."
-1	"MARRIAGE is disappearing . More than 40 percent of new mothers are unmarried . Many young adults drift into parenthood unintentionally . They may be cohabiting at the time of their childs birth , but about half of these couples will have split up by the time their child is 5 years old . College-educated young adults are still marrying before having children and planning their families more intentionally . The rest of America , about two-thirds of the population , is not .Weve been worrying about these trends for years , and wondering : Can marriage be restored as the standard way to raise children ? As much as we might welcome a revival , I doubt that it will happen . The genie is out of the bottle . What we need instead is a new ethic of responsible parenthood . If we combine an updated social norm with greater reliance on the most effective forms of birth control , we can transform drifters into planners and improve childrens life prospects .The drifters need better educational and job opportunities , but unless we come to grips with what is happening to marriage and parenting , progress will be limited . For every child lifted out of poverty by a social program , another one is entering poverty as a result of the continued breakdown of the American family . If we could turn back the marriage clock to 1970 , before the sharp rise in divorce and single parenthood began , the child poverty rate would be 20 percent lower than it is now . Even some of our biggest social programs , like food stamps , do not reduce child poverty as much as unmarried parenthood has increased it .The decline in marriage and the growth of childbearing outside of marriage is partly a result of the limited economic prospects of those at the bottom . We should provide more education and job opportunities for unskilled men in particular , but the evidence that these policies will restore stable families is sketchy . For one thing , although less-educated men are struggling , they still earn more than their female counterparts , and moneywise two incomes in a household are always better than one .Even if economics played a key role initially , it has propelled a huge shift in social norms that is by now deeply embedded in our culture . Not only are single-parent families far more common and socially acceptable than they were in the past , but scholars studying low-income or working-class communities have discovered that the women in these communities no longer think it is realistic to depend on the men in their lives . They have seen or experienced too much divorce , infidelity , substance abuse and other bad behavior to trust or fully rely on their partners .Liberals argue that we should accept the new reality and support single parents by providing more child care , health care , food and cash assistance . These efforts help , but with one-third of all children now living in families like this , and child poverty rates in these families four times as high as they are in two-parent families , this is a hugely expensive proposition . It is also inconsistent with a public ethic that values self-sufficiency over dependency .Conservatives , for their part , believe that the problem is cultural and that restoration of marriage is not only possible but the best route to reducing poverty and inequality . As Senator Marco Rubio , Republican of Florida , put it , the greatest tool to lift children and families from poverty is one that decreases the probability of child poverty by 82 percent . But it isnt a government spending program . Its called marriage.Conservatives , however , have never explained how to restore marriage . Everything they have tried  from marriage-education programs to changes in the way marriage is treated in tax and benefit programs  has had little or no effect .The debate between these two camps has been going on for a long time with no resolution . I first encountered it when I wrote a book on the growth of single-parent families in the wake of the controversy spawned by the 1965 report by Daniel Patrick Moynihan , which argued that the breakdown of the black family was the cause of most social pathologies in inner city communities . Now single parenthood is as common among whites as it was among blacks in the mid-60s . ( At that time , the proportion of black children living in single-parent families was 22 percent . It has subsequently risen to 72 percent . )I encountered the debate again during the administration of President Bill Clinton when , as an associate director of the Office of Management and Budget and a member of the presidents welfare-reform task force , I heard the argument that providing unconditional assistance to women raising children on their own was a major reason for the proliferation of such families . Although any evidence of such an effect was weak at best , I supported Mr. Clintons effort in 1996 to make welfare conditional on work . I hoped this would at least make women think twice before having a child on their own . But the growth of births outside of marriage has continued almost unabated .Not only are 40 percent of all children born outside marriage ( 50 percent among mothers under 30 ) , but 60 percent of these births were unplanned . New parents often come to accept and love the baby , but it is not an auspicious beginning . Research I did with Quentin Karpilow and Joanna Venator at the Brookings Institution shows that unplanned births affect childrens development , including their chances of graduating from college and earning a middle-class income .Such high rates of unplanned pregnancies may seem surprising given the ready availability of many forms of contraception . But it turns out that most people are not very good at using contraception consistently . Condoms , a popular contraceptive choice among young unmarried adults , have especially high failure rates . Among typical users , 63 percent will have experienced a pregnancy at the end of five years ( 40 percent will go on to have an abortion ) .Long-acting reversible contraceptives ( known in the field as LARCs and including implants and IUDs ) , could transform this landscape . The reason for high rates of unplanned pregnancies and births is not that young adults dont understand that becoming a parent is challenging ; its because they , like all of us , are prone to making mistakes and are often ambivalent about their intentions . If these or other new forms of contraception were more accessible and less costly , and if more people understood how effective and convenient they are , unplanned pregnancies would decline .The reason is simple . LARCs change the default from having to do something difficult ( reach for a condom or remember to take a pill every day ) to not having to do anything until one is ready to be a parent . Becoming pregnant requires a very deliberate decision to have the IUD or implant removed . For this reason , IUDs are 17.8 percentage points more effective than condoms and 8.8 percentage points more effective than the pill at preventing pregnancy ( although all of them are far better than using no protection at all , and condoms are still needed to protect against sexually transmitted infections ) . Despite a bad rap based on an earlier history associated with the dangerous Dalkon Shield , LARCs are also safe , according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists .A Washington University study of nearly 10,000 demographically representative women in the St. Louis region found that among those who were offered free contraception along with good counseling about the most effective methods , 75 percent chose a long-acting reversible contraceptive , and there was an 80 percent reduction in teen births and a 75 percent reduction in abortions among women in the cohort compared to national statistics. A similar program in Colorado , in which private funding was provided to 28 clinics to offer LARCs at little or no cost to women , also had great success , reducing births to high-risk , mostly poor young women , ages 15 to 24 , by 27 percent between 2009 and 2011 .The upfront cost of this type of contraceptive can be high , as much as $ 1,000 , but over a womans reproductive life it is cheaper than the pill . Research by my former Brookings colleagues Adam Thomas and Emily Monea shows that for every dollar invested in birth control , taxpayers save roughly five dollars on Medicaid-supported births and on social welfare payments for the mother and child . If these accidental births could be avoided , these 20-somethings might reach an age at which stable relationships are finally possible , unencumbered by a child from a previous relationship . And whether a woman finds a partner or not , by waiting she would be better prepared to raise a child by herself . Because the conversation has focused so heavily on marriage , we have lost sight of the fact that it is the quality of parenting that really matters , not just the structure of the family .It is in this context that any efforts , like the Supreme Courts decision in Hobby Lobby to curtail access to the most effective forms of birth control , are misguided . If we could make the most effective forms of birth control available to all women with no co-payment , we would not only have healthier children and lower child poverty rates , we would limit the extent of government assistance people need in the process .The Affordable Care Act required most insurance plans to cover all forms of contraception approved by the Food and Drug Administration , while also expanding Medicaid and community health centers . But the full implementation of these provisions is far from guaranteed . Current court challenges to the contraceptive coverage provision , the unwillingness of some states to expand Medicaid , and a lack of clinics and of doctors knowledgeable about and trained in the provision of LARCs are all impediments to an era of more responsible parenthoodBut greater access to the most effective forms of contraception is not enough . We also need a new ethic of responsible parenthood . That means not having a child before you and your partner really want one and have thought about how you will care for that child . Those from less privileged backgrounds may worry that they will never be able to afford a child . But two full-time $ 10-an-hour jobs bring in roughly $ 40,000 a year , hardly a princely sum yet enough to support a family well above the poverty line , even after child care and other expenses . These families should be receiving child-care subsidies and other forms of help . I can even imagine making certain benefits conditional on greater responsibility on their part , but think that might be too great a threat to individual rights . Softer nudges toward more responsible behavior can work just as well .SOCIAL norms do evolve . Fewer people now smoke and more of them wear seatbelts . Attitudes toward gays and women have shifted dramatically . Teenage pregnancy and birthrates have declined sharply in recent decades , partly because of new media messages ( like the TV show 16 and Pregnant ) and an emerging consensus that it is simply not a good idea to have a child as a teenager . The problem of unintended births has moved up the age scale ; a similar consensus could eventually emerge here too . Government or foundation-funded social marketing campaigns can change attitudes . Campaigns devoted to reducing teenage smoking and drunken driving have succeeded . The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy ( on whose board I serve ) has pioneered efforts of this kind to reduce pregnancy .We need more ( and better quality ) child care and a higher minimum wage , as well as serious education and training for those who are struggling to care for their families . But government alone cant solve this problem . Younger people must begin to take greater responsibility for their choices . The old social norm was , Dont have a child outside of marriage. The new norm needs to be , Dont have a child until you and your partner are ready to be parents. Whether or not it was a realistic norm in the past , it is now  precisely because newer forms of contraception make planning a family so much easier .Well-functioning democracies are built on the premise that government has an obligation to promote the general welfare . But so do citizens . More support for those who are drifting is in order , but less drifting is also essential ."
-1	"WASHINGTON  FOR years , particularly after the 2000 election , talk about the Supreme Court has centered on its bitter 5-to-4 divisions . Yet it is worth reflecting on a remarkable achievement : The court has agreed unanimously in more than 66 percent of its cases this term ( and that figure holds even if Mondays remaining two cases , on the Affordable Care Acts contraceptive coverage and on public-sector unions , are not unanimous ) . The last year this happened was 1940 .The justices ability to cross partisan divides and find common ground in their bottom-line judgment in roughly two-thirds of their cases  including the two decisions handed down Thursday , restricting the presidents ability to issue recess appointments during brief breaks in the Senates work , and striking down a Massachusetts ban on protests near abortion clinics  should remind us that even in this hyperpartisan age , there is a difference between law and politics .Unanimity is important because it signals that the justices can rise above their differences and interpret the law without partisanship . The best illustration of this in the modern era is Brown v. Board of Education , in which the court unanimously declared racial segregation in education to be unconstitutional . When the justices forge common ground , it signals to the nation the deep-seated roots of what the court has said and contributes to stability in the fabric of the law .The court has not always valued consensus so highly . At the nations founding , the justices each wrote separate opinions  leaving lawyers , and indeed the nation , to guess what the court was actually saying as a whole . It took Chief Justice John Marshalls leadership , at the start of the 19th century , to bring the court together and to establish the practice of writing a single opinion for the court . Marshall was not above using hard and soft persuasion , going so far as to invite his colleagues to live together in a Washington boardinghouse , where they bonded and discussed cases over Madeira . Disagreement on the court in that century was rare , with dissents occurring only roughly 10 percent of the time . Chief Justice William H. Taft , in the first decades of the 20th century , reportedly talked his colleagues out of more than 200 dissenting votes with his formidable political skills .But the modern era has been something of a disaster for unanimity . Chief Justice Earl Warren was able to achieve unanimity only 36.1 percent of the time ; Chief Justice Warren E. Burger , a scant 35.8 percent . One of Chief Justice William H. Rehnquists final public acts was to express exasperation at the fractured court . In 2005 , on the final day of his final term , a frail Rehnquist described his last majority opinion by first outlining his views , then the three concurrences filed , and then the three dissents filed , and joking , I didnt know we had that many people on our court. Compare that talk , and those numbers , to what Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. achieved this year with his colleagues .People remember Chief Justice Robertss 2005 confirmation hearing for his statement that his job would be to call balls and strikes . But something else he said is worth remembering : that he would try to bring about a greater degree of coherence and consensus in the opinions of the court. He pointed to Warrens leadership in Brown as an example .Unanimity , of course , would mean little if it were reserved only for minor things . But the court was unanimous this term in cases that posed big central questions , like whether the government could search your cellphone without a warrant , whether software could be patented , whether the rules for class-action securities lawsuits should change , and many others . Those cases were not easy ones . In the cellphone case , the government made forceful points about the ways in which those searches were permissible , and indeed necessary , for law enforcement . The software industry and its foes argued vociferously about whether software patents were destroying the economy or creating it . And so on . Whats more , the court wasnt unanimous because the justices sat on their hands ; to the contrary , they reversed the lower court 74 percent of the time this year .Many justices have pointed out the importance of published dissent . There is no doubt that dissents can serve a useful role by explaining when a justice thinks the majority has gone off the deep end . But unanimity also sends its own powerful message  one that might be eclipsed in the headlines by a sensational dissent , but could ultimately have a greater impact . Take the abortion decision on Thursday , which was unanimous in its bottom line , but not in its reasoning . Chief Justice Roberts joined four justices appointed by Democratic presidents  the same lineup that saved the Affordable Care Act two years ago , that time for a liberal result , unlike Thursdays .This path , of trying to forge places of agreement even among people who are inclined to disagree , is the essence of what the American experiment is all about . In an era when the leadership of the House of Representatives is suing the president , when people across the aisle can not even be in the same room with one another , the modesty and cultivated collegiality of the nine members of the Supreme Court this year remind us all that there is another way .Instead of worrying about balls and strikes , Chief Justice Roberts has shifted his efforts to a new focus : making all nine justices play ball for the same team . The country , and the rule of law , are better off for it ."
-1	"AN insidious trend has developed over this past third of a century . A country that experienced shared growth after World War II began to tear apart , so much so that when the Great Recession hit in late 2007 , one could no longer ignore the fissures that had come to define the American economic landscape . How did this shining city on a hill become the advanced country with the greatest level of inequality ?One stream of the extraordinary discussion set in motion by Thomas Pikettys timely , important book , Capital in the Twenty-First Century ,  has settled on the idea that violent extremes of wealth and income are inherent to capitalism . In this scheme , we should view the decades after World War II  a period of rapidly falling inequality  as an aberration .This is actually a superficial reading of Mr. Pikettys work , which provides an institutional context for understanding the deepening of inequality over time . Unfortunately , that part of his analysis received somewhat less attention than the more fatalistic-seeming aspects .Over the past year and a half , The Great Divide , a series in The New York Times for which I have served as moderator , has also presented a wide range of examples that undermine the notion that there are any truly fundamental laws of capitalism . The dynamics of the imperial capitalism of the 19th century neednt apply in the democracies of the 21st . We dont need to have this much inequality in America .Our current brand of capitalism is an ersatz capitalism . For proof of this go back to our response to the Great Recession , where we socialized losses , even as we privatized gains . Perfect competition should drive profits to zero , at least theoretically , but we have monopolies and oligopolies making persistently high profits . C.E.O.s enjoy incomes that are on average 295 times that of the typical worker , a much higher ratio than in the past , without any evidence of a proportionate increase in productivity .If it is not the inexorable laws of economics that have led to Americas great divide , what is it ? The straightforward answer : our policies and our politics . People get tired of hearing about Scandinavian success stories , but the fact of the matter is that Sweden , Finland and Norway have all succeeded in having about as much or faster growth in per capita incomes than the United States and with far greater equality .So why has America chosen these inequality-enhancing policies ? Part of the answer is that as World War II faded into memory , so too did the solidarity it had engendered . As America triumphed in the Cold War , there didnt seem to be a viable competitor to our economic model . Without this international competition , we no longer had to show that our system could deliver for most of our citizens .Ideology and interests combined nefariously . Some drew the wrong lesson from the collapse of the Soviet system . The pendulum swung from much too much government there to much too little here . Corporate interests argued for getting rid of regulations , even when those regulations had done so much to protect and improve our environment , our safety , our health and the economy itself .But this ideology was hypocritical . The bankers , among the strongest advocates of laissez-faire economics , were only too willing to accept hundreds of billions of dollars from the government in the bailouts that have been a recurring feature of the global economy since the beginning of the Thatcher-Reagan era of free markets and deregulation .The American political system is overrun by money . Economic inequality translates into political inequality , and political inequality yields increasing economic inequality . In fact , as he recognizes , Mr. Pikettys argument rests on the ability of wealth-holders to keep their after-tax rate of return high relative to economic growth . How do they do this ? By designing the rules of the game to ensure this outcome ; that is , through politics .So corporate welfare increases as we curtail welfare for the poor . Congress maintains subsidies for rich farmers as we cut back on nutritional support for the needy . Drug companies have been given hundreds of billions of dollars as we limit Medicaid benefits . The banks that brought on the global financial crisis got billions while a pittance went to the homeowners and victims of the same banks predatory lending practices . This last decision was particularly foolish . There were alternatives to throwing money at the banks and hoping it would circulate through increased lending . We could have helped underwater homeowners and the victims of predatory behavior directly . This would not only have helped the economy , it would have put us on the path to robust recovery .OUR divisions are deep . Economic and geographic segregation have immunized those at the top from the problems of those down below . Like the kings of yore , they have come to perceive their privileged positions essentially as a natural right . How else to explain the recent comments of the venture capitalist Tom Perkins , who suggested that criticism of the 1 percent was akin to Nazi fascism , or those coming from the private equity titan Stephen A. Schwarzman , who compared asking financiers to pay taxes at the same rate as those who work for a living to Hitlers invasion of Poland .Our economy , our democracy and our society have paid for these gross inequities . The true test of an economy is not how much wealth its princes can accumulate in tax havens , but how well off the typical citizen is  even more so in America where our self-image is rooted in our claim to be the great middle-class society . But median incomes are lower than they were a quarter-century ago . Growth has gone to the very , very top , whose share has almost quadrupled since 1980 . Money that was meant to have trickled down has instead evaporated in the balmy climate of the Cayman Islands .With almost a quarter of American children younger than 5 living in poverty , and with America doing so little for its poor , the deprivations of one generation are being visited upon the next . Of course , no country has ever come close to providing complete equality of opportunity . But why is America one of the advanced countries where the life prospects of the young are most sharply determined by the income and education of their parents ?Among the most poignant stories in The Great Divide were those that portrayed the frustrations of the young , who yearn to enter our shrinking middle class . Soaring tuitions and declining incomes have resulted in larger debt burdens . Those with only a high school diploma have seen their incomes decline by 13 percent over the past 35 years .Where justice is concerned , there is also a yawning divide . In the eyes of the rest of the world and a significant part of its own population , mass incarceration has come to define America  a country , it bears repeating , with about 5 percent of the worlds population but around a fourth of the worlds prisoners .Justice has become a commodity , affordable to only a few . While Wall Street executives used their high-retainer lawyers to ensure that their ranks were not held accountable for the misdeeds that the crisis in 2008 so graphically revealed , the banks abused our legal system to foreclose on mortgages and evict people , some of whom did not even owe money .More than a half-century ago , America led the way in advocating for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , adopted by the United Nations in 1948 . Today , access to health care is among the most universally accepted rights , at least in the advanced countries . America , despite the implementation of the Affordable Care Act , is the exception . It has become a country with great divides in access to health care , life expectancy and health status .In the relief that many felt when the Supreme Court did not overturn the Affordable Care Act , the implications of the decision for Medicaid were not fully appreciated . Obamacares objective  to ensure that all Americans have access to health care  has been stymied : 24 states have not implemented the expanded Medicaid program , which was the means by which Obamacare was supposed to deliver on its promise to some of the poorest .We need not just a new war on poverty but a war to protect the middle class . Solutions to these problems do not have to be newfangled . Far from it . Making markets act like markets would be a good place to start . We must end the rent-seeking society we have gravitated toward , in which the wealthy obtain profits by manipulating the system .The problem of inequality is not so much a matter of technical economics . Its really a problem of practical politics . Ensuring that those at the top pay their fair share of taxes  ending the special privileges of speculators , corporations and the rich  is both pragmatic and fair . We are not embracing a politics of envy if we reverse a politics of greed . Inequality is not just about the top marginal tax rate but also about our childrens access to food and the right to justice for all . If we spent more on education , health and infrastructure , we would strengthen our economy , now and in the future . Just because youve heard it before doesnt mean we shouldnt try it again .We have located the underlying source of the problem : political inequities and policies that have commodified and corrupted our democracy . It is only engaged citizens who can fight to restore a fairer America , and they can do so only if they understand the depths and dimensions of the challenge . It is not too late to restore our position in the world and recapture our sense of who we are as a nation . Widening and deepening inequality is not driven by immutable economic laws , but by laws we have written ourselves .This is the last article in The Great Divide ."

-1	"WASHINGTON  MORE than two million people have signed up for health insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act , a tribute to the effectiveness of the tech surge the Obama administration deployed to overcome the highly publicized problems with HealthCare.gov that emerged in October . The websites initial rollout will long stand as a monument to how badly technology contracting can go wrong . But the remarkable recovery also demonstrates what a determined response to such bungling can achieve .Sadly , food stamp and Medicaid recipients can only look on in envy . Just as disaster-relief agencies keep track of hurricanes , floods and earthquakes , students of anti-poverty programs remember a litany of automation and contracting meltdowns  some of them prolonged , even epic . Florida , 1992-93 . Michigan , 1998-99 . Colorado , 1998-2002 . Texas , 2006-7 . Indiana , 2007-9 . The Colorado Benefits Management System is particularly memorable : When first implemented , it reportedly refused food stamps to anyone who did not have a drivers license from Guam .But finding parallels to the HealthCare.gov meltdown requires no memory at all . Just as HealthCare.gov was filling the headlines , a contractor for the Georgia Department of Human Services was neglecting to send renewal notices to the homes of some 66,000 food stamp recipients and about half that number of Medicaid beneficiaries . On Nov. 1 , the states computer system  which goes by the Orwellian acronym Success  automatically terminated benefits to all those affected for failure to cooperate with reviews they had never been told were underway .In December , a Massachusetts contractor sent thousands of people new electronic food stamp benefit cards and immediately deactivated their old cards  without waiting to see if the new ones had arrived in the mail . Many had not . In mid-October , a contractors glitch made food stamps inaccessible to recipients in 17 states .The White House showed impressive alacrity in fixing HealthCare.gov . But its response to technology failures affecting low-income people has been far more sluggish . The federal Department of Health and Human Services did eventually direct Georgia to reactivate the Medicaid benefits for those wrongfully terminated . The federal Department of Agriculture ( which administers food stamps , now known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program ) brushed aside repeated pleas to tell Georgia to reinstate food assistance in time for Thanksgiving .Instead , Georgia told its desperate people to reapply through a website , though it operated only intermittently . Wrongfully terminated households could call to request paper applications  but the call center answered fewer than 30 percent of the calls it received in September , and the lucky few who did get through had average waiting times of 34 minutes . They could go into a local food stamp office  but once there , they would only be directed to a terminal to try to get on the website or a phone to try to get through to the call center . Not just Orwell , but Kafka and Dickens come to mind .Nor was this latest failure an isolated episode . In July 2012 , a group of Atlanta eligibility workers told the federal Agriculture Department that case managers were falsely documenting that they were calling customers and getting no answer and using that excuse to justify denial of food-stamp assistance .The Agriculture Department did not investigate these whistle-blowers complaints . When my name appeared in an Atlanta news article about the food stamp debacle , a state employee called me to report a backlog of 12,000 applications waiting to be entered into the Success database .All of this reflects a broader double standard for automation and contracting  and for government administration generally . An Indiana state judge described a familiar pattern in an earlier food stamp and Medicaid automation contracting fiasco : Officials implemented a supersized contract , an untested theoretical experiment ,  that resulted in irremediable personal suffering of needy Hoosiers.A few years ago , a former federal official , frustrated at frequent indifference to low-income Medicaid beneficiaries , joked darkly that the two big government health insurance programs should be called Med-I-Care and Med-I-Dont-Care. ( Elderly Medicare users are politically far more important than the poor and disabled customers of Medicaid . )Properly supervised contractors can use technology to improve the delivery of government services . But attention , oversight and willingness to act decisively to remedy fiascoes seem to depend on the wealth and clout of those who are affected . As Obamacare regains its footing , that lesson shouldnt be forgotten ."
-1	"BILTMORE LAKE , N.C.  ON Sept. 11 , anti-gun-control legislators in the Missouri General Assembly are likely to pass a bill , over the governors veto , that renders almost all federal gun laws void in the state , and even makes it a crime for federal agents to enforce them .Missouri is only the latest state to push back against federal gun laws . In Montana , the Firearms Freedom Act , passed in 2009 , purports to exempt any gun manufactured and kept within the state from federal regulations ; despite a federal appellate court decision last month invalidating the statute , it has served as a model for new or pending laws in more than a half-dozen states .But while states are not powerless in the face of federal law , there are limits to what they can do to prevent enforcement of constitutionally valid regulation .The bills are based on the theory of nullification , which has its roots in the late 18th and early 19th centuries and holds that the federal government exists by the will of the states , and that states therefore have the right to decide which federal laws are constitutionally valid within their borders .When it comes to gun control , the claims of nullification advocates are threefold : no state is required to enforce federal gun regulations , states may prevent federal officials from enforcing laws declared by the state to be unconstitutional , and some federal gun restrictions are in fact unconstitutional  either because they violate the Second Amendment ( says Missouri ) or are outside the scope of the federal governments power to regulate commerce ( says Montana ) .On the first point , the nullifiers are correct : in a 1997 decision , Printz v. United States , the Supreme Court held that the Federal Government may not compel the States to enact or administer a federal regulatory program. That case involved the Brady Act of 1993 , which established a national system for background checks and commanded state law enforcement officials to conduct them .Of course , background checks are still required in every state . Thats because federal officials are authorized to enforce their own laws , even if they can not compel the states to do so . Thus , on the second point , the nullifiers are wrong : states can not impede federal enforcement of a federal law merely because the state deems it unconstitutional . That is up to the federal courts .Yes , state legislatures or governors can assert that a federal law offends the Constitution . But as James Madison wrote in his Report of 1800 , such declarations are expressions of opinion for exciting reflection . The expositions of the judiciary , on the other hand , are carried into immediate effect. In assessing constitutionality , our system of governance recognizes one Supreme Court , not 50 individual states .Strangely , if nullification proponents had their way , Chicagos gun ban , which the Supreme Court invalidated in 2010 , might still be in effect . Moreover , if the court had not held in 1960 that nullification is illegal defiance of constitutional authority ,  many public schools might have remained segregated .That brings us to the third point : whether the Constitution holds that federal gun laws are unconstitutional . If it does , then states would be justified in preventing enforcement . But despite pleas from the gun rights community , the Supreme Court has not gone that far .Indeed , when the Court overturned Washingtons handgun ban in its 2008 decision in District of Columbia v. Heller  in which I was co-counsel to the plaintiff , Dick Heller  Justice Antonin Scalia , who wrote the majority opinion , was careful to note that the right to keep and bear arms is not absolute .He wrote that his opinion did not cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill , or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings , or laws imposing conditions and qualifications  like background checks  on the commercial sale of arms.Subsequent cases will determine which regulations are allowable . But until the courts say otherwise , federal gun laws are presumptively consistent with Second Amendment rights .What about Montanas argument that federal restrictions on guns made and transported entirely within the state exceed Congresss power to regulate interstate commerce ? Over protests from some libertarian activists , myself included , the Supreme Court has consistently expanded the federal governments power to regulate commerce to cover any economic act that , in the aggregate , could have a substantial effect on interstate commerce  even if the act is not strictly commercial and is wholly within one state .Meanwhile , nullification battles extend beyond gun laws . Nearly two dozen states have condoned medical marijuana use in defiance of federal restrictions . Washington and Colorado have even legalized recreational marijuana use . At least 23 states have considered bills that nullify the Affordable Care Act of 2010 .I fully support those who see risks in the expansion of federal power , particularly when it comes to intrusions on basic rights like gun ownership . However , to defend those rights , we cant begin by flouting the very document that inspires that fight in the first place : the Constitution ."
-1	"AS the predominantly black , disproportionately poor community of Ferguson , Mo. , erupted in protest after the shooting death of Michael Brown , critics excoriated President Obama for his failure to empathize . Michael Eric Dyson , for example , called the presidents statement about the case on Monday a stunning epic failure.Mr. Obamas defenders point to his second-term commitment to issues that touch the lives of poor communities of color , especially his initiative to assist young minority men , My Brothers Keeper . But what both sides are ignoring is the presidents first-term record .A true measure of a presidents priorities lies hidden in plain sight in his budget proposals . Under that standard , Mr. Obama has been more committed to communities like Ferguson than any Democratic president in the past half century .By looking at what percentage of the budget presidents propose to spend to fight poverty , we can compare their degree of commitment .While Mr. Obama advocated for the Affordable Care Act as a way to assist poor African-Americans , for example , we cant put that on an effort scale and compare it to President Bill Clintons advocacy for his health care plan . Our method also avoids the problem of accounting for forces beyond presidents control .Using this method , we find that President Obama attempted to deliver far more than his counterparts . The Congressional Budget Offices inflation-adjusted numbers show that Mr. Obama sought to spend far more on means-tested anti-poverty programs than other first-term Democratic presidents . The targeted needs include food , housing , education , health care and cash .Mr. Obama earmarked 17 percent of his budget for these needs , versus Mr. Clintons 12 percent and Jimmy Carters 8 percent . These presidents all faced economic challenges , although of different degrees and strength . Each was committed to the needs of the poor and the disadvantaged . But Mr. Obama made good on that commitment far more concretely .No president gets all he requests , but the outcomes speak well for Mr. Obama , too . Christopher Wimer of Columbia University found , for example , that tax and transfer policies lowered the poverty rate by only 1 percentage point in 1967 , under President Lyndon B. Johnson , but by almost 13 points in 2012 .Did Mr. Obama plan to spend more simply because he had more mouths to feed ? No . Even after accounting for the higher numbers of poor people caught in the Great Recession , Mr. Obamas record outshines his predecessors . His proposed first-term spending per poor individual was $ 13,731 to Mr. Clintons $ 8,310 and Mr. Carters $ 4,431 , in 2014 dollars .Mr. Obama even exceeds Mr. Johnson , whose budget priorities amounted only to $ 111 per poor person . ( Because Mr. Johnson was the first postwar president to tackle poverty issues with so many new programs , it is not surprising that his proposed funding levels were low at the start . ) The same pattern shows up in spending per poor family . Mr. Obama allocated $ 67,132 , Mr. Clinton $ 39,820 , Mr. Carter $ 20,790 , and Mr. Johnson $ 546 , again using 2014 dollars .Nor is Mr. Obama simply a big spender across the board . His spending on the Department of Agriculture , for example , was lower than Mr. Clintons and Mr. Carters , removing food stamps and adjusting for inflation .A final test of priorities is how much a president proposes to spend compared with his immediate predecessor . By that yardstick , Mr. Obama does well too . The percent change in anti-poverty spending per poor individual is highest for Mr. Clinton relative to the first President Bush ( 27 percent ) , and lowest for Mr. Carter , who actually spent slightly less than Gerald R. Ford . Mr. Obamas increase relative to George W. Bush was a respectable 17 percent . When it comes to the poor , Mr. Obama does not appear a failure , much less an epic one .So why does Mr. Obama elicit fiery condemnation for lacking empathy ? His first four State of the Union speeches provide several telltale clues . These are a presidents showcase , watched , in recent years , by up to 52 million viewers . What did Mr. Obama signal to those millions ?First , he rarely mentioned poverty . Listeners had to hunt for words like poor or homeless. His average poverty word count is seven , lower than Mr. Carters nine and Mr. Clintons 23 . Second , the little he did say was drowned in a wave of words aimed at the middle class , like average earner. His ratio of middle-class-related words to poverty-related words was nearly 3 to 1 .When he did mention the needs of the poor , he tiptoed around them . His ratio of direct mentions of poverty to indirect mentions was 1 to 3 . Contrast that with Mr. Clintons 8-to-1 ratio . Even Mr. Carters was higher than Mr. Obamas ( 1 to 2 ) . By favoring words like vulnerable and unemployed so heavily , Mr. Obama nearly gave up the bully pulpit .While critics are right to chastise Mr. Obama for his pallid rhetoric on race , at least as president , they are wrong to say that he does not care about poor communities of color . Mr. Obama has been spending without saying . He should get at least as much credit for the former as vilification for the latter ."
-1	"The website SCOTUSblog is applying , once again , for credentials to cover SCOTUS , the Supreme Court of the United States . Its already been turned down twice . But the Senate Press Gallery , which is in charge of such things , should relent this time around . At least , that is , if the site completes the transformation it started about seven years ago , from what was essentially a promotional website for a legal practice , to a fully independent journalistic venture .In the past three years , scotusblog ( thats how users refer to it ) has received key awards for legal journalism and proven itself indispensable to a fast-growing group of lay followers in addition to the judges , law clerks , lawyers and academics who closely observe the Supreme Court . Yesterday , a slow day at the court , the site received 37,000 visits . Last June , the day the court handed down its ruling upholding much of the Affordable Care Act , around a million people learned about the decision via the sites live blog . The site covers the court more comprehensively than it has ever been coveredevery argument and every case decided as well as important-seeming requests for the court to review a lower-court ruling . The site provides links to all briefs from competing parties and friends of the court . Its contents are available without charge .In October last year , Bloomberg News became the sites sponsor under a three-year contract making it the sole advertiser in exchange for covering the sites operating expenses , $ 332,000 this year . That has allowed scotusblog to pay the equivalent of three and a half full-time employees and about 20 part-time employees .Lyle Denniston , the sites full-time reporter at the court , is by far the most important scotusblogger and has been since he joined the site in 2004 . At 81 , he has been covering the court for 54 years18 for The Washington Star ( now defunct ) , almost 20 for The Baltimore Sun . His credentials to cover the court are now through WBUR , an FM radio station based in Boston .Under his old-school approach  he decides what he writes about , in well-informed , judicious pieces of analysis and explanation  scotusblog emphasizes carefully gathered information over quickly manufactured opinion and emphasizes the court rather than self-promotion .But thats not how the site ran when it started , which is likely part of why the Senate Press Gallery has been so coy . Ten years ago , the current publisher , Tom Goldstein , and the current editor , Amy Howe , married to each other then as now and lawyers both , launched scotusblog as a vehicle for advertising their budding law practice . Their theory was that blogging about the court would demonstrate their expertise and bring them clients . They have succeeded in building an admired practice , but , as Mr. Goldstein told me , no thanks to version 1.0 of the site .As scotusblog evolved into a relied-on news source , its staff developed policies for avoiding conflicts of interest . The site adheres to standards Mr. Denniston shaped to ensure that scotusblog is seen as impartial and objectiveincluding about Mr. Goldsteins arguments before the court . ( In October , Mr. Denniston wrote that a tack Mr. Goldstein tried only seemed to confuse things , and the Justices ( perhaps affected by inattention ) were not following . If his argument did not seem exactly doomed , it looked , at best , shaky. )But the only way to guarantee that there are no conflicts of interest for the site is for it to become independent of Mr. Goldstein and Ms. Howes firm , with Mr. Goldstein giving up his role as publisher and Ms. Howe her role as editor while they are practicing before the Supreme Court . The journalism they launched is now too important to be saddled with an asterisk ."
-1	"By Casey NeistatDiet programs revolve around a proven principle : if you burn more calories than you consume , you will lose weight . The calorie is the defining metric . And so , in the interest of public health , the Food and Drug Administration requires most packaged foods to list their calories , among other data , on labels . To help combat obesity in New York City , the Department of Health requires most chain restaurants to post calorie content on their menus and fines those who dont comply . Thanks to the Affordable Care Act , a national program will soon follow .In theory , this is a valuable reform . But theres one glaring problem . According to the F.D.A . and the citys health department , no one verifies the accuracy of these calorie listings . The system essentially runs on an honor system . Food vendors can list whatever numbers they want , until someone ( somehow ) catches a problem and files a complaint . So , as an obsessive calorie counter myself , I wanted to find out : how accurate are these labels ?For this Op-Doc video , I selected five items I might consume in an average day : a muffin , a tofu sandwich , a Subway sandwich , a Starbucks Frappuccino and a Chipotle burrito . Then , two food scientists at the New York Obesity Nutrition Research Center at St. Lukes-Roosevelt Hospital Center painstakingly tested the caloric content of each using a device called a bomb calorimeter . Its a precise but slow process  taking more than an hour per sample . The results were surprising .SPOILER ALERT : Four out of the five items I tested had more calories than their labels reported , adding up to 550 calories . If I unknowingly consumed those extra calories every day , in a week I would put on an extra pound of body weight . Not good .After you watch the video , you might wonder how to explain the discrepancies between the lab tests and the food labels . I called the companies for some answers . Morrisons Pastry company , which makes muffins sold at many corner bodegas in New York , said it did not want to comment on its muffins . So I have no idea how to explain those extra calories . An employee at the tofu sandwich company , whose sandwich had nearly double the number of calories the label stated , told me that he wasnt sure how the company came up with the data . He said the company would look into it and , if it found results similar to mine , would change the information on its labels . Starbucks and Chipotle both explained that , since their products are made by hand at their shops , there are often small variations in calories . Neither Starbucks nor Chipotle measures calories in a lab , like I did . Instead , they do it on paper  adding up the calories of each ingredient . Dr. Russell Rising from the obesity research lab told me that this process can be especially inaccurate as the calorie values for each ingredient are often outdated . Subway said it conducts both in-house and independent studies to substantiate its calorie information . A spokesman emphatically stressed that the accuracy of nutritional data is important to the company .By testing only five items , my little study is hardly conclusive  I was left with more questions than answers . So it would be unfair for me to make broad conclusions about the food industry or point fingers at specific companies . But theres one thing I can say for certain : our current system for regulating calories is woefully inadequate . With all the attention focused on what our government can do to curb the obesity epidemic , why not start by policing nutritional data ?"

-1	"CAN we still be arguing about a womans ability to control her own fertility ? Almost 50 years ago in Griswold v. Connecticut , the Supreme Court struck down state restrictions on contraception because they violated a right to privacy . But the issue has not gone away . Rick Santorum injected it into the presidential race by indicating that Griswold should be overturned so that states could ban contraception altogether . And the Senate just voted down a Republican effort to allow employers and health insurance companies to refuse coverage for contraceptives if they had moral or religious objections .Why are issues that the courts decided so long ago still unresolved ? Maybe it is time to recognize that law alone is not enough to effect social change . It must be linked to social activism on behalf of womens rights .I should know . Fifty-five years ago , I had an opportunity to take a stand in favor of the right of women to control their fertility  and I did so through the courts .It was 1957 , and fresh out of the University of Wisconsin I enrolled in the Yale Law School  one of only six women in my graduating class . In my second year at Yale , several of our professors asked my husband and me to join a lawsuit challenging Connecticuts birth-control law , which outlawed the sale and use of contraceptive materials and prohibited a doctor from prescribing birth control even to married women . One goal of the lawsuit was to remove the statutory obstacle to opening Planned Parenthood clinics in Connecticut so that poor families could have access to family-planning services .I immediately agreed to join the case . Others did as well , but my husband and I were the only ones to use our real names . Because people used pseudonyms , the lead case came to be called Poe v. Ullman , but there was a companion case called Trubek v. Ullman . Poe raised a variety of grounds for challenging the statute and eventually landed in the Supreme Court .I was proud to put my name on the case . To serve as a plaintiff , though a largely passive role , suited my vision of my future as a social justice lawyer . I supported Planned Parenthood . I believed women should have access to birth control so they could have both a career and a family . I wanted those things for myself . I was no sexual radical : I was married , a good girl uninterested in sexual freedom , and I thought of abortion as frightening . But I was planning to have a family and a career as a lawyer . I believed I should be free to choose the timing of my childrens births so I could do both .Poe was thrown out by the Supreme Court on a technicality . To force the issue , Planned Parenthood opened a clinic , leaving the state with no choice but to close it down . This landed the issue back in the Supreme Court  this time with different plaintiffs , as Griswold v. Connecticut  which found the statute an unconstitutional intrusion on marital privacy .The privacy argument in Griswold led to the legalization of contraception . But it also had a much larger impact : the privacy doctrine played a central role in Roe v. Wade ( 1973 ) , which declared some barriers to abortion unconstitutional ; was used by the court in Lawrence v. Texas ( 2003 ) , which struck down bans on consensual same-sex sexual activity ; and has been cited in state court decisions upholding same-sex marriage .We can celebrate Griswold , Roe and all the cases that stemmed from the Poe litigation . They are important landmarks in American jurisprudence . But as I look back I am dismayed by how few of the issues I was fighting for at the time of Poe are resolved . To be sure , we have important rights and more legal privacy . But we still have not provided all the support women need to combine rewarding careers and healthy families . Planned Parenthood is under siege and poor women who are seeking comprehensive reproductive care are still at risk . Presidential candidates can get away with saying that all contraception should be outlawed . Comprehensive child care services are difficult to locate , and fully financed family and medical leave is still controversial .In short , we won the legal battle but not the war . Women are still not guaranteed control over their lives , because the necessary social supports were never secure . The initial goal of Griswold was to help women  and even though the precedent has helped with same-sex marriage laws , those initial needs , especially of poor women , have been left largely unmet .The universal coverage plan outlined in President Obamas Affordable Care Act is a good step forward , and we should do all we can to ensure it . Perhaps if activism had been linked to the lawsuits , the aims I fought for would have been secured , and we would be spared the spectacle of Republican candidates threatening , yet again , a womans right to control her own fertility ."
-1	"BERKELEY , Calif.  CONGRESS began its summer recess last week and wont reconvene until after Labor Day . Youd be forgiven for not noticing a difference . With just 15 bills signed into law so far this year , the 113th Congress is on pace to be the most unproductive since at least the 1940s .But just because the legislature has ceased to function doesnt mean our government has . Political decision making has moved to peripheral public entities , where power is exercised less transparently and accountability to voters is less direct . What were losing in the process isnt government  its democracy .Take the Federal Reserve . Absent any Congressional legislation to speak of  no short-term spending to increase job growth , no long-term plan to reduce the budget deficit  the nations central bank has been forced to do all the heavy lifting with the economy . The $ 85 billion of bonds it buys each month is now the main form of government stimulus to the economy as well as the linchpin of continued job growth . Congresss inability to pass effective fiscal policy means that the Feds monetary policy , to keep long-term interest rates as low as possible , has become the only game in town for boosting private spending and investment .But the strategy also poses serious risks , like asset bubbles , if borrowers use the cheap money to speculate ; bond collapses , if the Fed slows its bond buying too quickly and spooks the market ; and inflation , if low interest rates cause buyers and sellers to expect prices to rise . It could also increase income inequality , by giving wealthy investors a cheap source of funds to expand their portfolios . Forcing the Fed to become the sole decision maker on the economy is also why the selection of a new Fed chairman has become so important  even more important than it ought to be .Congresss paralysis has also encouraged the Supreme Court to enter the political fray . Normally the judicial activism of recent years could be checked by Congressional action . But not now . Justice Anthony M. Kennedys opinion for the majority in the 2010 Citizens United case , which struck down limits on corporate campaign contributions , rested partly on the presumption that Congress would require corporations to disclose their political expenditures . But no bill requiring full disclosure has stood a chance of making it through the quagmire .The courts decision this summer in Shelby County v. Holder handed Congress the task of coming up with a new , updated formula for deciding which states and localities need permission from the Justice Department , under the Voting Rights Act , to make changes to their election processes . But legislative paralysis makes the passage of any new formula highly unlikely . Seen in this light , Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.s deciding vote last year to uphold the Affordable Care Act probably reflected his reasonable fear that the court would otherwise be viewed , not unfairly , as just another political battleground .Or consider climate change . Its a public debate the nation briefly embarked on in the 2008 presidential race , when John McCain and Barack Obama presented different plans for cap-and-trade systems . Naturally , gridlock in Congress put an end to it . After the election , Mr. McCain backed off any cap-and-trade plan , and the two parties have been at loggerheads over the environment ever since .The issue ultimately lost the spotlight to a debate over Mr. Obamas choice for administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency , Gina McCarthy , who is expected to use the E.P.A.s authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate the carbon emissions of power plants ; and to a Congressional showdown , motivated in part by Mr. Obamas E.P.A . appointment , over the use of the filibuster on presidential nominees .Mr. Obama won the skirmish and got his administrator , but dont expect much public deliberation over carbon emissions from here on . The E.P.A . will handle the issue through regulatory rule making , mostly unchecked by Congress and the public .A final displacement of national politics has been onto state governments , now grappling with everything from undocumented immigrants and gun control to gay marriage and abortion . While many political matters should be left to the states , these cry out for federal standards because of the relative ease with which undocumented immigrants , gun sellers , gay couples and women seeking abortions can transport themselves to more accommodating jurisdictions .Whats more , these institutions arent even understood by the public to be making political decisions with national implications . Media coverage tends to be narrowly drawn for insiders  macroeconomists , constitutional scholars , E.P.A . watchers , the residents of a particular state  or trivialized for outsiders : Should the next Fed chief be female ? Are Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas too openly partisan ? Is Ms. McCarthy too much of a firebrand ? Are red states diverging from blue states ?The Republican right  mostly new House members who are supported by the Tea Party and who are in open rebellion against the rest of the right  are probably pleased with the gridlock in Congress . They would like nothing better than to stop the federal government from functioning . But they may not fully grasp that their efforts have only shifted power elsewhere in the system .Some of the institutions gaining power may be making decisions consistent with conservative values : the Supreme Court and some state governments , for instance . But hardly all ( the Fed and the E.P.A . ) .In any event , its bizarre that a self-styled populist insurrection would end up making our government less accountable to the people . But thats exactly what its done . Whats really gridlocked now is democracy ."
-1	"Reince Priebus made a joke on Sunday .I dont know that he meant to  comedy isnt his forte  but the only way to hear one of his comments on Meet the Press was as a put-on . He said that Hillary Clinton wouldnt run for the presidency if she has another month like she just had ,  with questions about Monica , about Benghazi , about Boko Haram , about her brain .I almost fell down . For one thing , shes had countless months like that . For another , theyre the only kind on the horizon : Hillary as the fodder for the morning talk shows ( on Sundays panels , she came up 98 times , according to a Washington Post tally ) and Hillary as a piata for late-night comedians ; strenuously marketed Hillary scandals with a modicum of merit and strenuously marketed Hillary scandals with none .If Republicans believed in global warming , theyd surely divine her hand in it . Speaking of body parts , I suspect well move from Hillarys brain to her heart , probably her liver , possibly her pancreas and maybe even her pinkie toe . What Hillary goes through in the public arena isnt an examination . Its a vivisection .That she endures it is admirable . That shes so willing to is scary . With all politicians , you worry about the intensity of the hunger that enables them to suffer the snows of Iowa and the slings and arrows of outrageous pundits . With Hillary and Bill , you worry that its rapaciousness beyond bounds .You also grow weary . The Clintons are exhausting . And thats just one of many drawbacks worth discussing as Hillary plays Hamlet , mulling what to do .Shes without doubt the contender to bet on . But shes a contender with baggage and obstacles that get woefully short shrift in all the nonstop chatter about her inevitability .For starters , Americans have been in a pessimistic mood for an unusually sustained period , their faith in the political system at rock bottom . How does someone whos been front and center in that system for more than two decades  whos a symbol of intense partisan warfare  become the voice of change ? Theres no Dont Stop ( Thinking About Tomorrow )  for Hillary . Tomorrow was yesterday .Remarks she made in Washington on Friday illustrated that point . At a conference titled Big Ideas for a New America ,  she mused about what the 1990s taught us ,  looking into the future by traveling into the past , which isnt the terrain on which presidential elections are typically won .Bill traveled there just two and a half weeks earlier , in a speech of his own at Georgetown University . Speech is too paltry a word ; this was one of those ego extravaganzas , like his aria at the Democratic National Convention , that went on and on and reaffirmed his talent for making everything , including the current income-inequality debate , about him . In this case he was singing the praises of his own presidencys economic record .He was also serving notice that despite his screw-ups during Hillarys 2008 campaign , it may be impossible to muzzle him in 2016 . Just last week , on yet another stage , he again joined the fray , proclaiming Hillary blameless for Benghazi and vouching that her concussion was merely that . Theres a thin line between chivalry and butting in . Can he stay on the right side of it ? If not , he could hurt her candidacy , overshadowing her and undercutting her feminist story line .She has additional challenges . If Obamas approval rating doesnt rise , his would-be successors will be best served by breaking with him . For Hillary thats hard . Given her history on health insurance , she cant run against the Affordable Care Act . Given her role in his administration , she cant run against his foreign policy .How does she simultaneously defend and defy him ? Its a balancing act that Al Gore never perfected in regard to her husband .The last month has indeed been instructive , demonstrating how practiced Republicans are at attacking her  and how exuberant they are about it . I think they want her to run . Shes the devil they know . Shes the dragon worth slaying .Shes considered inevitable in part because shes political royalty , awash in money and celebrity endorsements , but is royalty what an economically frustrated , embittered electorate wants ? With fame of her duration and magnitude , how does she find a common touch ?And how does she show us anything that she hasnt shown us before , introducing or even reintroducing herself ?Maybe any sense of staleness will be expunged by the prospect of a first female president , but she lacks an opportunity that many successful presidential candidates enjoyed : that period of the rollout when a more detailed biography emerges , a personality is defined and voters get a chance to swoon .We cant fall in love that way with Hillary , not at this point . Were too far past the roses and Champagne ."
-1	"What if we gave her some aloe vera gel ? The question was from a thin woman , and though her query came out of desperation , her face was pinched with fury . She was a relative of the patient in the room , a young woman who was dying of an infection .Thats where gel , which the relative embraced as an herbal remedy , came in . It fell to me , the nurse , to explain why aloe vera could not cure the infection , could not save this patients life . But what I was really doing was something we often fail to do in hospitals : facing the anger and fear that accompany impending death .Its not easy to talk about death . President Obama acknowledged this reluctance when he tried to include reimbursement for end-of-life conversations in the Affordable Care Act . The conservatives ease at recasting such efforts as government death panels shows how hard the topic of death is for many people . There is a point of breakdown at which a body will irrevocably fail . In health care we understand that in terms of physiological details . Whats hard for all of us is accepting the painful truth that people die .The patient in this case had received a stem cell transplant from a matched donor to treat her cancer . She had been taking immune suppressants to keep the donated cells from attacking her own body . The challenge is that such patients are susceptible to infections that wouldnt trouble healthy people . Thats what happened with this patient . She contracted a fungal infection , and despite our best efforts at treatment , it got into her brain .For several weeks she had been asking for all curative treatment to stop , but her doctors kept saying it was too soon . At the point where I was assigned to her , the doctors had finally agreed that nothing more could be done to save her life . As a result of that decision the extended family had gathered to say goodbye . That was the group I walked in on when I took over the patients care in the afternoon .The relatives from far away had not seen the patients sad and slow decline . They were not prepared to say goodbye , and they were angry . The doctors had given up on her , they said . Her husband wanted her to die . No one was trying hard enough to find the one thing that could save her . Maybe aloe vera gel would be the silver bullet .I had been this patients nurse often in the past , but not recently , so I didnt have solid answers for them . Wait ,  I finally said as the questions came fast and furious , Im not putting you off . I need to read her chart so that I can accurately tell you what you want to know . I will come back.I was lucky ; I had time to sit down and make sense of the patients treatment history , even though there wasnt a lot of sense-making to be done . Roughly 30 percent of patients are dead within a year of such stem cell transplants , and this patient fell within that group .You cant tell a family only that , though , because theres no balm in it . And by balm I mean empathy for just how terrible it is for someone known and loved to die .I went back to the room and again was lucky to have the time to really talk with the angry relatives . I told them the story of this young womans cancer treatment , how she got high doses of chemotherapy to kill her cancer and the infusion of stem cells afterward essentially gave her a new immune system . I talked about immune suppression creating vulnerabilities to odd illnesses , like fungal infections . I told them the patient herself had been asking to go into hospice care long before her doctors assented .I said that a body can get too broken to be repaired and , despite all our drugs and scans and cutting-edge procedures , sometimes we just cant fix someone , even if we ourselves helped create the problem that is killing her .The aloe vera gel came up again , and I said it probably wouldnt hurt . The thin woman , now in the chair , her legs tightly crossed in front of her , waved my suggestion away with a quick flip of her wrist and I realized that the relatives werent really intent on giving the patient aloe vera ; what they needed was for someone in the hospital to understand how much they wanted this young woman to live , how desperate they were to reverse fate .We can call this denial , hubris , fighting until the bitter end . But why not call it what it is ? Being human and fearing death , the family could not , in the words of Dylan Thomas , stop raging against the dying of the light .We read that famous poem as an exhortation : Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night. I wonder if it is instead a reckoning of how very difficult it is to let life go ; the poem was , after all , written about Thomass own father . Wise men at their end know dark is right ,  the poem tells us , but they and good men ,  wild men ,  grave men do not go gentle , because death inevitably brings regret for what might have been , what now will never be .The idea that compensation be given for discussions about patients health care choices at the end of their lives targeted this existential knot . It takes time to untangle the threads surrounding death  guilt , fear , anger and love  but its work that needs to be done , by nurses and doctors , following the patients preferences and physical reality . Because no matter how much we hate it , death will come .Ive seen a fair number of people die , and the truth is , some go gentle into that good night , but many do not , regardless of their intentions . For my patient it was the same . Her mind seemed to have acquiesced weeks before , but her body , so fragile and battered by disease , hadnt . A good friend of mine was her nurse the day she died . I need to talk to you ,  she told me soon after the patients passing . So long in coming and impossible to reverse , the end itself had been bloody , even gruesome . It was a hard memory for my friend , a seasoned oncology nurse , to bear alone .Ive never forgotten that afternoon in the hospital . Outside , day turned to dusk and then evening . The patient occasionally moaned , but was mostly silent . The thin woman in the chair was still angry , but as dark filled the windows outside the frustration in the room sublimated into a dull acceptance . We did not go gently into that good night , but we went , nonetheless .Theresa Brown is an oncology nurse and the author of Critical Care : A New Nurse Faces Death , Life , and Everything in Between."

Since they began seeing patients in 2011 , theyve treated 1,800 of them . They expect to work with that number every year starting in 2015 .Many poor countries use C.H.W.s on an enormous scale  in rural areas , where doctors and nurses are scarce , a C.H.W . often serves as the doctor . In the United States , their role is different . White and her colleagues have no medical training . ( Before this , she was a family health worker with the Supportive Child Adult Network . ) Theyre chosen for their ability to listen , support and encourage , without judgment . They are people from the same communities as their patients , and often with the same struggles . They help patients with the many factors keeping them sick that arent typical doctor problems .This is a crucial role in a country where vast numbers of people are sick with chronic lifestyle-related diseases . Doctors cant help patients change their behavior in the 15 minutes they spend with each patient . But community health workers can .Yet C.H.W.s are few in the United States . Some promotora programs employ them in Native American and Latino communities , especially with migrant workers . A few states make them a part of health care  and Obamacare will increase that number .Every so often you see a foundation sink a lot of money into community health worker programs ,  said Prabhjot Singh , a Columbia professor and doctor in East Harlem who is co-chair of the One Million Community Health Workers Campaign . The DNA of a lot of these programs comes from an activist , almost anti-bottom-line perspective . They are grant funded , and theres a lot of academic interest but there is not a way to systematically invest in C.H.W.s. So even though many studies  this is a good compilation ( pdf )  show they improve health and save money , these programs rarely last very long or grow .The Penn Center was founded by Shreya Kangovi , an internist and pediatrician who is an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School . Before she and her colleagues designed the IMPaCT program , they reviewed other C.H.W . programs to see why they didnt last .They found several common problems . Most important , C.H.W.s were rarely integrated into a health care systems processes or its financing . They were often all by themselves , in a church basement ,  Kangovi said . If they were doing great work , no one knew about it and no one paid for it. Many programs vanished when their grant money disappeared .There were also staffing problems  lots of turnover , lots of workers who werent right for the job . Organizations didnt understand what kinds of skills they needed and how to identify the people who had them . Many C.H.W . programs were disease-specific  but a lot of patients have multiple serious illnesses . And the work wasnt standardized : Few programs had manuals , for example . Each new worker was re-inventing the job .Kangovi and her colleagues tried to attack these problems systematically . They decided that C.H.W.s wouldnt limit their scope , but help patients with any health goal . They made hiring decisions and designed a manual and formal training based on the barriers to care cited by the patients . They aimed to have a plug-and-play model that other hospitals could use .It is still early , but there are some good signs . Staff turnover has been zero . The researchers tracked the impact of having a C.H.W . visit patients at hospital discharge and for two weeks after . Patients who got the visits saw a doctor sooner , had better mental health and were less likely to later have multiple readmissions than patients in a control group . ( The program had no effect on patients physical health or medication adherence  not unexpected given such a brief intervention , ) The long-term home visits the C.H.W.s do now are aimed at improving patients chronic diseases . The center is halfway through a long study looking at that .The Penn Center is one of several new models hospitals are trying to make C.H.W . programs sustainable . ( Theres a whole other way of doing this , too  programs run by community organizations , paid for largely by cities or states . ) Another is Grand-Aides . Unlike the Penn C.H.W.s , Grand-Aides dont help with social or logistical issues . They are nurse extenders who get hundreds of hours of medical training . Each patient visit is supervised in real time by phone by a nurse , who makes all the decisions . A pilot at two pediatric Medicaid sites in Texas showed that the program cut readmissions by at least two-thirds .Arthur Garson Jr. , who directs the Health Policy Institute of the Texas Medical Center in Houston and founded Grand-Aides , believes that C.H.W . programs have stayed small because most dont certify their workers . His program requires each Grand-Aide to pass a test for certification every year . Its a way of standardizing the work and building confidence with hospitals . Hospitals want to know they are competent and tested yearly ,  he said . Currently 14 hospitals in the United States use Grand-Aides  Garson says the program will be in 40 hospitals by spring 2015 .Do hospitals make money from C.H.W . programs ? Some believe they do . Garry L. Scheib , the chief operating officer of the University of Pennsylvania Health System , said that Penn had a financial as well as a medical interest in putting the C.H.W . program in its budget and tripling its size .The real economic benefit for us is the open beds it creates ,  he said . I usually have a waiting list for inpatient beds. Hospitals profit most by filling those beds with patients who need complex , specialty surgeries and care  especially when they carry private insurance . IMPaCT patients , by contrast , often need routine care , or non-medical help . They carry Medicaid ( which brings in little revenue ) or are uninsured ( a total loss ) . Hospitals must accept these patients , so keeping them as healthy as possible  preferably outside the hospital  is good .Scheib said IMPaCT also saves Penn money because its staffers are a low-wage way ( their pay starts at $ 14 an hour ) to stretch and complement doctors and nurses who are paid a lot more .But Singh warns that only a minority of hospitals are solvent enough to see things the way Penn does . Most have huge reservations about bringing on yet another work force , along with care managers and care coordinators . And providers dont really have great incentives to reach out to Medicare and Medicaid patients that are hard to reach . If these patients dont come to an appointment , well , thats just how it goes . Maybe the hospitals internal quality indicators go down a little  but it doesnt warrant pounding the pavement to find these people.Given the rarity of C.H.W . programs , this is obviously how many hospitals think . The emergency room is still a profit center for many hospitals , as long as patients have some insurance .Hospitals are also resistant because C.H.W . programs lie outside their core competency . If its community health workers or nurses , theyll always go with nurses . Its easier  even if theres a sizeable population nurses are unable to reach ,  said Heidi Behforouz , an associate physician in the global health equity division at Brigham and Womens Hospital in Boston . ( She ran Partners In Healths PACT program , perhaps the most renowned C.H.W . program in the United States . Even that program didnt survive the loss of charitable funding  it was transferred to another organization , in much diminished form . ) Not a lot of places have glommed on to Yes , we need the community health worker model. Obamacare is changing this calculus . Medicare now bases a small part of its reimbursement to hospitals on measures of quality , including readmissions  which gives hospitals an incentive to help patients stay healthy . In a major shift for C.H.W.s , the federal government this year permitted state Medicaid funds to pay for their work , as long as it was initially recommended by a doctor or other licensed practitioner .But the biggest change initiated by the Affordable Care Act is a gradual shift away from fee-for-service medicine to rewarding quality , not quantity . With that shift , hospitals and payers will be looking for what Singh calls the lightweight infrastructure that takes care of people outside of the hospital.If fee-for-service disappears , there is more emphasis on prevention , wellness and quality of life in the long term ,  said Behforouz , Then everybody would be pushing for community-based models that kept people at home.Join Fixes on Facebook and follow updates on twitter.com/nytimesfixes .

-1	"You might think that the methodical extermination of millions of Jews by a brutal regime intent on world domination would resist appropriation as an all-purpose metaphor . You might think that genocide , of all things , would be safe from conversion into sloppy simile .Youd be wrong .After Paul Ryans fact-challenged address at the Republican National Convention last year , the chairman of the Democratic Party in California actually compared him and his compatriots to the Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels . A short time later , the chairman of the Democratic Party in South Carolina likened that states Republican governor , Nikki Haley , to Adolf Hitlers mistress , Eva Braun .At that point Abraham Foxman , the national director of the Anti-Defamation League , did what he shouldnt need to do even once , let alone the multiple times that hes been forced to . He implored politicians and pundits to stop it already .No matter . Allusions to Nazi Germany were back for debates over gun control and , of course , Obamacare . Ted Cruz , the Senates prince of tirades , compared people who claim that the new insurance program cant be stopped to those who rolled over for Hitler and the Third Reich . This prompted a public reprimand from John McCain , who has developed something of a sideline career of swatting Cruz on the nose . Theyre like a hapless master and his hopeless dachshund . The former keeps trying to housebreak the latter , while the latter just beams at every mess he makes .Its not only Nazis who are flourishing in this era of metaphors gone mad , of analogy bloat . Lynch mobs are also having a good go of it . A senator who was quoted anonymously in The Times last week used that term to describe the Republican lawmakers who had lit into Cruz during a private luncheon , and lynching was invoked more disturbingly by the chief executive officer of A.I.G. , who recently said that public complaints about Wall Street bankers bonuses were intended to get everybody out there with their pitchforks and their hangman nooses. This , he added , was sort of like what we did in the Deep South.How absolutely bonkers . And yet how unsurprising . Were awash these days in metaphors as overworked as our political debate is overwrought , and its impossible not to wonder how much one contributes to the other . When nuance and perspective exit the language , do they exit the conversation as well ? When you speak in ludicrous extremes , do you think that way , too ?Obamacare has proved to be not just ideologically divisive but linguistically fertile . Theres seemingly no event or passage in American history to which it cant be compared .The terrorist attacks of 9/11 ? Check . Back when Mike Pence , Indianas Republican governor , was still in Congress , he summoned that days horror to characterize the Supreme Court ruling that upheld the Affordable Care Act .Slavery ? Check . Ken Cuccinelli , the Republican candidate for governor of Virginia , has described opposition to Obamacare in terms of stands against fugitive slave laws .The hyperbole and hysteria make any constructive debate impossible , and they insult the past , robbing important events of the specific meaning and individual detail they deserve . Consider our recurring -gate mania . We equate each new scandal , whether extra-large or fun-size , with Watergate , and by willfully misremembering President Richard Nixons crimes , we dilute them . Its just a suffix for the taking , a point of comparison for such wildly unrelated matters as the spilled secrets of Arkansas law enforcement officers who were supposedly privy to Bill Clintons private life . Troopergate , that was called .For President Obama , Benghazi was supposed to be his Watergate , and so was the I.R.S.s scrutiny of conservative groups , and so were a bunch of other things I cant even remember anymore . They blur and fade , which is not to say they didnt matter . Its to say that when everything is supposedly like everything else , nothings distinctive . Its all one big mush .For that reason , among others , we should watch our words . They have consequences . As irresponsible and detestable as the recent actions of the most conservative wing of House Republicans have been , wed be better off without figurative talk of hostage taking and guns to heads , without headlines like one in The Huffington Post that said : Boehner Threatens to Shoot the Hostage. That sort of language only turns up the heat .And I cringe at how pointlessly hurtful it must have been for a 9/11 widow or widower to listen to the right-wing moralist Gary Bauer exhort voters to fight back against President Obamas agenda the way passengers on United Flight 93 fought back against hijackers . Or for Holocaust survivors to hear all this gratuitous Nazi talk .You know whats just like Germany in the 1930s ? Germany in the 1930s . Were in an unfortunate place , but we neednt travel back there to describe it ."
-1	"OAKLAND , Calif.  WHEN I lived in New York during the early 1960s , John F. Kennedy was a hero among the downtown art crowd  not because of any legislative or foreign policy achievement , but because he pardoned the jazz pianist Hampton Hawes .Hawes was a bebop pianist with a right-hand technique so brilliant that he was admired by none other than Art Tatum , widely considered the greatest jazz pianist ever . Hawes had been sentenced to 10 years in a Fort Worth prison for buying drugs from an undercover agent .Just after my third Christmas I was watching John Kennedy accept the presidency on the Washington steps ,  Hawes wrote later . Something about him , the voice , the eyes , the way he stood bright and coatless and proud in that cold air ... I thought , thats the right cat ; looks like he got some soul and might listen. He applied for a pardon , and received one from the president on Aug. 16 , 1963 .Democrats have more of an affinity for jazz than Republicans . Even Jimmy Carter , not everybodys idea of a hipster , invited Dizzy Gillespie to the White House . But among the Democrats , President Obama is the one who comes closest to the style of bebop called the Cool.Cool jazz is exemplified by the saxophone of Lester Young and his protg Stan Getz ; the trumpet of Miles Davis ( especially on his 1957 album Birth of the Cool ) ; the vibraphone of Milt Jackson and the song stylings of Billie Holiday , Sarah Vaughan and June Christy .Like the president , cool musicians carried themselves with a regal bearing . Some members of the generation before them had to engage in minstrel-like antics to make a living . Cool musicians demanded respect , and when attacked didnt blow up , but , like the president , responded stoically . One of his favorite words is persistence ,  the attitude of his hero , the saxophonist Sonny Rollins , the greatest surviving bebopper .For a while in the mid-20th century , the Cool was everywhere . As youngsters in the 50s , my friends and I talked cool , walked cool and dressed cool . For us , if you werent cool , you were hot , square or corny . We thought that Louis Armstrong was too hot and corny , until we read about his dispute with President Dwight D. Eisenhower over school integration . Armstrong had guts .Last month I got to see the president of the Cool at the San Francisco Jazz Center , a $ 64 million building that opened earlier this year . I am in my second term as its poet laureate , and one of my poems , When I Die I Will Go to Jazz ,  has been installed on one of the buildings walls ( in an alley named after Hawess memoir , Raise Up Off Me ) , so I was invited to attend the event .The pianist who anchored the evening , Herbie Hancock , is cool . He was accompanied by other cool musicians , like the saxophonist Joshua Redman and the bassist Esperanza Spalding , who was so engaged in her instrument that she seemed attached to it .An added attraction were the SFJazz High School All-Stars , a group of white , black and Asian-American students . One of the graduates , the young flutist Elena Pinderhughes , performed with the trio and held her own .Outside , though , it was hot . Demonstrators against everything from military drones to energy pipelines greeted the presidents entourage when it arrived .After being introduced , the president just about bounced onto the stage . A few days earlier I had heard a commentator say he seemed in the dumps these days . That afternoon he was fresh , unruffled  in other words , cool . ( Maybe it was because our states health-insurance exchange , Covered California , demonstrates how well the Affordable Care Act works when implemented correctly : My youngest daughter got a silver plan that drastically reduces her monthly premiums within an hour of applying . )One hallmark of a cool musician , like Ms. Spalding earlier in the evening , is an intensity and focus that lurks underneath the detached exterior . The same with Mr. Obama that night .He hit repeatedly on his version of the American dream , that if you work hard you can succeed , no matter who you are . His recent speeches have abandoned the tough love rhetoric that targeted blacks exclusively ; he now includes millions of whites in talking about a tangle of pathologies ,  something the political scientist Andrew Hacker first noticed in his 1992 book Two Nations.At one point , a member of the audience began heckling Mr. Obama , demanding that he be more aggressive on progressive legislative issues .The president replied , without skipping a beat , A lot of people have been saying this lately on every problem . Just sign an executive order and we can do everything. The Constitution tells him to do otherwise .Then the president of the Cool left to make a speech in Los Angeles .In 2010 Mr. Obama awarded the National Medal of Arts and Humanities to Mr. Rollins , the saxophonist . Oftentimes , there is a gulf between the people receiving this medal and the person conferring it . What does a president know about theater , or architecture ?Not so that day . When awarding Mr. Rollins the medal , the president said that his music had helped inspire me , or get me through a tough day , or take risks that I might not otherwise have taken.I can dig it  an expression that is now considered corny ."
-1	"WOODSTOCK , Ga.  THERES a political axiom that says if nobody is upset with what youre doing , youre not doing your job . Weve seen this proved time and again in the liberal attacks on conservatives like Sarah Palin and Dr. Benjamin Carson , who provide principled examples to women and minorities and are savaged by the left for doing that job so well .But cheap-shot politics isnt relegated to Democrats . Last week the House speaker , John A. Boehner of Ohio , attacked conservative groups who criticized the budget deal , hashed out by Representative Paul D. Ryan , Republican of Wisconsin , and Senator Patty Murray , Democrat of Washington , for failing to reduce spending and for raising taxes .Theyre using our members and theyre using the American people for their own goals ,  he said , calling the opposition ridiculous.In one way , Mr. Boehner is correct . The goals of groups like ours are those that congressional Republicans once espoused : smaller government , less spending and lower taxes . Alas , those who demand such things today from their elected officials face unfounded attacks .Make no mistake : The deal is a betrayal of the conservatives who fueled the Republicans 2010 midterm shellacking of Democrats .It raises discretionary spending above $ 1 trillion for 2014 and 2015 . It reneges on $ 63 billion of sequester cuts . Its $ 28 billion in deficit reduction over the next decade is a pittance compared with the $ 680 billion deficit piled up in 2013 alone . And it raises taxes , particularly on airplane passengers through new travel fees .Perhaps most troubling is that the deal locks in spending for President Obamas Affordable Care Act , ensuring that the worst parts of Obamacare will continue unfolding to the shock of increasing numbers of Americans .But the budget plan is about more than taxes and spending . It was a slick means by which Senate Republicans could appear to oppose the deal while in fact allowing it to sail through the chamber .Take Senator Mitch McConnell , Republican of Kentucky , the minority leader , who opposed efforts to defund Obamacare earlier this year while claiming to do everything possible to stop it .After attacking conservative groups for their efforts to prevent the funding of Obamacare , Mr. McConnell , who is facing a primary challenge in his 2014 re-election race , is now seeking to portray himself as a conservative darling , championing fiscal austerity by voicing opposition to the budget proposal . ( My organization has not endorsed a candidate in that race . ) Doing so gives him some nifty talking points that align with most conservative groups , but it is little more than parliamentary sleight of hand .Consider how he handled the vote on the bill . To defeat a filibuster , its supporters needed 60 senators to win cloture and move to a final vote . Instead of rallying his troops against the vote , Mr. McConnell allowed a handful of Republicans in battleground states  who needed to be seen as supporting the bill  to vote for cloture , while he and the rest railed against it , casting themselves in the role of budget hawks .With cloture accomplished , a dozen Republicans were then free to vote against final passage if they need wiggle room when theyre confronted on the campaign trail next fall by voters demanding action on government spending . Mr. McConnell and many Senate Republicans used the vote to manipulate the system , allowing them to cast themselves as deal makers or principled conservatives , depending on their audience .This is not principled policy making ; what were seeing is simple gamesmanship that raises legitimate questions about which values Republicans truly hold and which are merely interchangeable with those of Democrats .The job of Tea Party groups and other conservatives is pretty simple : to inform Americans about the need for restraint in spending , tax relief , pro-growth economic policies and individual liberty  and to support the men and women who pledge to promote these positions . To the extent that the speaker of the House and Senate Republicans are attacking such groups , it looks as if were doing our job .But after this budget vote , our job expands to include informing Americans about who keeps their word in Congress and who does not .When establishment Republicans call spending increases spending cuts , deny that raising taxes is a hike , and champion deficit reduction that doesnt scratch the surface of our nations debt , it suggests a detachment from the facts . But when those who voted for them criticize their elected officials for not keeping their promises , and are then attacked for doing so , it suggests that Kurt Vonnegut was right in observing , A sane person to an insane society must appear insane."
-1	"WHEN the Supreme Court announced its decision on the Affordable Care Act last month , the media went wild . The rush to judgment took seconds . CNN and Fox News initially described the decision incorrectly , saying five justices had struck down the law . Even after corrections , the snap analysis that followed wasnt very helpful . The multipart decision is complex , and its ramifications will take months or even years to understand .The blink response to this case is only the latest example of a troubling increase in the speed of our reactions . E-mail , social media and the 24-hour news cycle are informational amphetamines , a cocktail of pills that we pop at an increasingly fast pace  and that lead us to make mistaken split-second decisions . Economists label the problem present bias : we are vulnerable to fast , salient stimulation .Fortunately , there is an antidote : the conscious pause . Scientists have found that although we are prone to snap overreactions , if we take a moment and think about how we are likely to react , we can reduce or even eliminate the negative effects of our quick , hard-wired responses .For example , countless studies have shown that physicians immediate , unconscious reactions to racial minorities lead them to undertreat black patients . In one study published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine in 2007 , researchers asked several hundred doctors about a hypothetical 50-year-old male patient who showed up with chest pain . The researchers gave the doctors a photograph of the man , randomly varying his race . Half saw him as white ; half saw him as black .Sure enough , although the doctors insisted they were not racially biased , they were more likely to prescribe thrombolysis , an anti-blood-clotting procedure , for the white patient , while giving the black patient a less-aggressive prescription . The doctors didnt appear racist , yet their unconscious snap reactions led them to treat blacks differently  the very definition of racism .However , about one in four of the doctors guessed that the study was designed to test racial bias . They stopped for a moment and considered how they might react differently depending on race . The researchers found that this aware subgroup did not treat patients differently . Once they paused to consider whether race was an issue , race was no longer an issue .Snap decisions can be important defense mechanisms ; if we are judging whether someone is dangerous , our brains and bodies are hard-wired to react very quickly , within milliseconds . But we need more time to assess other factors . To accurately tell whether someone is sociable , studies show , we need at least a minute , preferably five . It takes a while to judge complex aspects of personality , like neuroticism or open-mindedness . If we need to understand how nine justices resolved a difficult legal issue , we need even more time .But snap decisions in reaction to rapid , even subliminal stimuli arent exclusive to the interpersonal realm . Sanford DeVoe and Chen-Bo Zhong , psychologists at the University of Toronto , found that viewing a fast-food logo for just a few milliseconds primes us to read 20 percent faster , even though reading has little to do with eating . We unconsciously associate fast food with speed and impatience and carry those impulses into whatever else were doing . Subjects exposed to fast-food flashes also tend to think a musical piece lasts too long .Yet we can reverse such influences . If we know we will overreact to consumer products or housing options when we see a happy face ( one reason good sales representatives and real estate agents are always smiling ) , we can take a moment before buying . If we know female job screeners are more likely to reject attractive female applicants , as a study by the economists Bradley Ruffle and Zeev Shtudiner shows , we can help screeners understand their biases  or hire outside screeners .John Gottman , the marriage guru made famous in Malcolm Gladwells best-selling book Blink ,  explains that we quickly thin slice information reliably only after we ground such snap reactions in thick sliced long-term study . When Dr. Gottman really wants to assess whether a couple will stay together , he invites them to his island retreat for a much longer evaluation : two days , not two seconds .Our ability to mute our hard-wired reactions by pausing is what differentiates us from animals : primates and dogs can think about the future only intermittently or for a few minutes . But historically we have spent about 12 percent of our days contemplating the longer term .The beginning of summer is supposed to be the time for us to slow down and take a breath . Go to the beach with a few books . Spend downtime with family . Tune out . But instead of jumping into the swimming pool , we have leapt into a whirlpool of news .Still , although technology might change the way we react , it hasnt changed our nature . We still have the imaginative capacity to rise above temptation and reverse the high-speed trend . There are a couple of summer months left , and no time to waste ."
-1	"EARLIER this year , we got what seemed like the first good news on obesity rates : A study in JAMA found that there had been a 43 percent drop in the obesity rates of 2- to 5-year-old children in the last decade . But then , last month , that news was contradicted by researchers at the University of North Carolina who used the same data to find that obesity rates had remained flat after all .With two-thirds of adults and one-third of kids overweight or obese , its hard not to feel discouraged . If current trends continue , by 2030 , the incidence of obesity-related conditions like Type 2 diabetes could be 20 times what it is today , costing the American economy up to an additional $ 580 billion annually .Are we losing the war on obesity ,  as the New York City mayor , Bill de Blasio , put it , and not doing enough to defeat it ? No . In fact , if we compare the fight against obesity to the last public health challenge of similar size  the fight against smoking  it turns out that we are being much more aggressive today .Research linking smoking to lung cancer began appearing in medical journals as early as the 1920s , but the dangers didnt reach the popular press until 1952 , when Readers Digest published Cancer by the Carton. Still , smoking rates continued to rise . Between 1940 and 1964 , consumption more than doubled to nearly 4,500 cigarettes per adult per year . They were everywhere : Hollywood movies , military rations , the workplace , you name it .Finally , in 1964 , Luther L. Terry , the surgeon general , unveiled a report titled Smoking and Health. He called a Saturday news conference in which , for the first time , the government acknowledged that smoking is causally related to lung cancer.It still took until 1970 for Congress to ban cigarette advertising on TV and radio ; until 1975 for the military to stop including cigarettes in rations ; until 1982 for the federal cigarette excise tax to be raised ; until 1990 for Congress to ban smoking on domestic flights ; until 1997 for President Clinton to ban smoking in most government buildings ; until 1998 for cigarette manufacturers to acknowledge that smoking was addictive and caused cancer ; and until 2003 for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to ban smoking in New York Citys restaurants and bars . And it wasnt until 2009 that the federal excise tax on cigarettes became truly effective , when it was raised to $ 1.01 .This multipronged effort  comprising advertising restrictions , prohibitions on where people could smoke and taxation  changed behavior and ultimately the nations health . Beginning in the mid-1970s , per capita cigarette consumption steadily declined . Today , the percentage of adult Americans who smoke is less than half what it was in Dr. Terrys day  18 percent  and per capita cigarette consumption is less than 1,500 per year .As a result , in the early 1990s , lung cancer deaths for men began to decline . For women the decline began in the mid-2000s . There is more to be done , but we have bent the tobacco curve .When it comes to obesity , the country has responded much more nimbly . Researchers first reported serious upticks in childhood and adolescent obesity in the mid-1980s , and policy makers quickly took notice .Within a decade , in 1994 , the Clinton administration limited the salt and saturated fat in school lunches . In 2001 , the surgeon general issued a Call to Action. In 2006 , three of the largest beverage companies voluntarily agreed to limit their offerings in school vending machines to water or low-calorie options . In 2010 , Michelle Obama started her Lets Move campaign to end childhood obesity in a generation . And that same year the Affordable Care Act passed , with a provision requiring large restaurant chains to post calorie counts on their menus . In 2012 , Disney banned junk food advertising on all of its child-targeted TV and radio platforms . Today , 34 states and the District of Columbia have enacted some kind of additional tax on sodas and sugary drinks .True , many proposals have been stymied . The Food and Drug Administration seems to have given up on its consideration of front-of-the-pack labeling . Regulations implementing menu labeling still havent been issued . Proposed restrictions on advertising to children were suspended amid Republican attacks . And the soda industry has successfully repelled excise taxes in many states by deploying the same tactics the cigarette manufacturers used  sizable political contributions and charges of discrimination against the poor .But there do appear to be tentative signs that the obesity curve is flattening . A Robert Wood Johnson Foundation report last year found that adult obesity rates remained level in every state except Arkansas . And despite the dueling studies on childhood obesity rates nationwide , the rates among children in some of Americas largest cities appear to be coming down . In places like Philadelphia , New York City and Los Angeles , rates are down 3 to 5 percent compared with a few years ago .We cant ease up now . Fully implementing calorie count provisions , requiring more explicit nutritional labeling and banning advertising of sugary sodas and other less nutritious foods to children would be good ways to keep up the momentum .But there is reason to be optimistic : We are moving much faster against obesity than we did on the successful effort against tobacco ."
-1	"IF you listened to Justice Anthony M. Kennedy of the Supreme Court and his fellow conservatives on the bench this week , you might think the courts 5-4 decision in the case of Town of Greece v. Galloway was no big deal . So what if a town in upstate New York typically opens its council meetings with prayers that acknowledge the saving sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross ?If you listened to the people who shepherded the case as it ascended the judicial hierarchy , however , the decision represents one of their biggest victories to date . It wasnt just an answer on prayer  it was an answer to prayer !  read a statement by the Family Research Council . The council is one of a host of organizations guided by the religious liberty advocacy group the Alliance Defending Freedom that backed the defendants with legal resources .To understand why the cases backers were so cock-a-hoop , you must first know something about the long game being played by the religious right . The goal is to get back to a soft establishment of religion in America  that is , a system in which formal guarantees of religious freedom and the official separation of church and state remain in place , but one religion is informally or implicitly acknowledged as the approved religion of the majority and a legitimate basis for public policy .This was more or less the situation in the United States during the first half of the 19th century . In 1811 , the New York Supreme Court upheld a conviction for blasphemy ( the archetypal union of church and state ) on the grounds that the state had an interest in punishing offenses to the religious sensibilities of the Protestant majority . Back then , nativist Protestants imposed their version of the Bible in public schools , while Catholics rioted in protest and placed their children in parochial schools .Through the 19th and 20th centuries , however , the judicial thinking on church-state issues evolved , and the soft establishment became much harder to justify . The United States Supreme Court introduced the Lemon test ,  for example . Named for a 1971 case the court heard , this required that legislation concerning religion should not result in excessive government entanglement with religious affairs . The Supreme Court also increasingly took the view that government should abstain from any activity wherein a reasonable observer might perceive it to be endorsing religion .Today , groups like the A.D.F .  which also represents Conestoga Wood Specialties Corporation in its challenge to the contraception mandate in the Affordable Care Act  are deeply unhappy with the reigning jurisprudence on church-state separation . It would seem that they wish to undermine the Lemon test , which they consider burdensome ,  as a staging post to restoring a soft establishment of Christianity in the United States . This is where Greece v. Galloway comes in .The first order of business is to remove objections by swiping aside the idea that soft forms of establishment exist at all . Here , the Greece decision delivers , substantially .Offense ,  Justice Kennedy wrote in his majority opinion , does not equate to coercion. Justice Clarence Thomas , in the part of his concurring opinion joined by Justice Antonin Scalia , drew out the key implication : To the extent coercion is relevant to the Establishment Clause analysis , it is actual legal coercion that counts  not the subtle coercive pressures allegedly felt by respondents in this case. In other words , religious observance counts as establishment only if you are compelled to kneel by law .A second element of the plan for undermining concerns based on the First Amendments Establishment Clause is to reinterpret public acts as personal expressions of speech by private individuals . Thus , when the minister appointed by the municipal government of Greece bids all rise ,  the Supreme Court majority tells us , this is not an establishment of religion because the words are not uttered by public officials . And when the town leaders respond with a sign of the cross , that isnt establishment either , because , just then , public officials are acting as private individuals .Another prong in the assault on the Establishment Clause is to use neutrality among religious denominations as a wedge for inserting the ( presumed ) majority religion into state business . In theory , neutrality means giving every sect an equal shot at officiating prayer at Greeces council meetings . In practice , the town government has unquestionably identified itself with what it takes to be the majority religion in the area .In his concurring opinion , Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. dismissed concerns about the blatantly sectarian tilt of the towns proceedings , which were led exclusively by Christian ministers for nearly a decade , by pointing out that Jews make up a mere 3 percent of the local population and alleging that other non-Christian groups are no larger .A final , crucial part of the strategy is to substitute history  or , more accurately , a particular mythologized version of history  for legal analysis . Here the A.D.F . and its allies have hit pay dirt in the Greece decision .Justice Kennedy invoked an earlier , highly problematic decision in the case of Marsh v. Chambers to suggest that the usual legal tests were unnecessary because the history supported the conclusion that the prayers were compatible with the Establishment Clause . It is , however , preposterous to say that something is constitutional simply because its been done in the past .The history here sustains a myth that early America had a single religion of Christianity ,  when , in fact , it was bitterly divided into antagonistic sects from the start . And many of Americas founders  James Madison , for example  were firmly opposed to such precedents of church-state entanglement as congressional chaplains .The assault by the religious right on the Establishment Clause has been unfolding for two decades , in a number of landmark cases . Under cover of pursuing religious freedom ,  it has already succeeded in inserting fundamentalist religion into parts of Americas public education system . With Greece v. Galloway , it has now expanded the reach of this novel and destructive interpretation of the Establishment Clause . It is part of a project to restore a version of America that never was , and never can be ."
-1	"CAMBRIDGE , Mass .  THERES an old lament about my profession : if you ask three economists a question , youll get three different answers .This saying came to mind last week , when the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science was awarded to three economists , two of whom , Robert J. Shiller of Yale and Eugene F. Fama of the University of Chicago , might be seen as having conflicting views about the workings of financial markets . At first blush , Mr. Shillers thinking about the role of irrational exuberance in stock markets and housing markets appears to contradict Mr. Famas work showing that such markets efficiently incorporate news into prices .What kind of science , people wondered , bestows its most distinguished honor on scholars with opposing ideas ? They should make these politically balanced awards in physics , chemistry and medicine , too ,  the Duke sociologist Kieran Healy wrote sardonically on Twitter .But the headline-grabbing differences between the findings of these Nobel laureates are less significant than the profound agreement in their scientific approach to economic questions , which is characterized by formulating and testing precise hypotheses . Im troubled by the sense among skeptics that disagreements about the answers to certain questions suggest that economics is a confused discipline , a fake science whose findings can not be a useful basis for making policy decisions .That view is unfair and uninformed . It makes demands on economics that are not made of other empirical disciplines , like medicine , and it ignores an emerging body of work , building on the scientific approach of last weeks winners , that is transforming economics into a field firmly grounded in fact .It is true that the answers to many big picture macroeconomic questions  like the causes of recessions or the determinants of growth  remain elusive . But in this respect , the challenges faced by economists are no different from those encountered in medicine and public health . Health researchers have worked for more than a century to understand the big picture questions of how diet and lifestyle affect health and aging , yet they still do not have a full scientific understanding of these connections . Some studies tell us to consume more coffee , wine and chocolate ; others recommend the opposite . But few people would argue that medicine should not be approached as a science or that doctors should not make decisions based on the best available evidence .As is the case with epidemiologists , the fundamental challenge faced by economists  and a root cause of many disagreements in the field  is our limited ability to run experiments . If we could randomize policy decisions and then observe what happens to the economy and peoples lives , we would be able to get a precise understanding of how the economy works and how to improve policy . But the practical and ethical costs of such experiments preclude this sort of approach . ( Surely we dont want to create more financial crises just to understand how they work . )Nonetheless , economists have recently begun to overcome these challenges by developing tools that approximate scientific experiments to obtain compelling answers to specific policy questions . In previous decades the most prominent economists were typically theorists like Paul Krugman and Janet L. Yellen , whose models continue to guide economic thinking . Today , the most prominent economists are often empiricists like David Card of the University of California , Berkeley , and Esther Duflo of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , who focus on testing old theories and formulating new ones that fit the evidence .This kind of empirical work in economics might be compared to the micro advances in medicine ( like research on therapies for heart disease ) that have contributed enormously to increasing longevity and quality of life , even as the macro questions of the determinants of health remain contested .Consider the politically charged question of whether extending unemployment benefits increases unemployment rates by reducing workers incentives to return to work . Nearly a dozen economic studies have analyzed this question by comparing unemployment rates in states that have extended unemployment benefits with those in states that do not . These studies approximate medical experiments in which some groups receive a treatment  in this case , extended unemployment benefits  while control groups dont ."
-1	"HANOVER , N.H.  A COUPLE of months ago , JAMA Internal Medicine , a journal of the American Medical Association , published the findings of a brief online survey of middle-aged Americans.Most had previously been screened for either breast or prostate cancer . But the study found that about half said they would not choose to start screening if the test resulted in more than one overtreated person per one cancer death averted .Wow . That implies that millions of Americans might choose not to be screened if they knew the whole story  that overtreatment is typically more common than avoiding a cancer death .Is the survey right ? Honestly , I have no idea . Different surveys get different answers . According to surveys , most of us hate Obamacare . But a number of us like the Affordable Care Act ( another name for the same thing ) . And most of us like the bulk of the individual components of the law . How you ask the question matters .Similarly , how Americans feel about screening is obviously related to what they are told about screening . Most of the time they get a simple message : Its the most important thing they can do to stay healthy . Occasionally , they may hear just the opposite : Its dangerous . The truth is , its neither .Instead , its a close call . Different people in the same situation can rationally make different choices . But first , patients need some quantification of the benefits and harms .In a study to be published Monday , Dec. 30 in JAMA Internal Medicine , a colleague and I attempt to provide that data for women making the choice about screening mammography . Lets be clear at the outset : There is a lot of uncertainty  and professional disagreement  about what the data are . So we provide a range of estimates , from optimistic to pessimistic .There is no doubt that screening mammography in the United States leads to a lot of false alarms . Among a thousand 50-year-old American women screened annually for a decade , how many will have at least one false alarm ? Our estimate ranges from 490 to 670 . The data come from the mammographers themselves  the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium  and reflect radiologists who deliver low and high rates of false alarms ( those in the 25th and 75th percentiles ) .A screening program that falsely alarms about half the population is outrageous . To be sure , many women are quickly reassured by a second test that their breast is normal . But others  while told they dont have cancer  are told that their breast is somehow abnormal , that they have dysplasia or atypia , that they are at high risk. Whether you blame the doctors or the system or the malpractice lawyers , its a problem that needs to be fixed .Then there is the problem of overdiagnosis : the detection of a cancer that was not destined to ever cause problems . Overdiagnosis is what leads to overtreatment . A decade ago doctors debated whether this problem existed in breast cancer . Now the debate is about how often it occurs .In a pamphlet to help women decide about mammography screening in Britain , the National Health Service now explicitly tells women that their chance of overdiagnosis is about three times higher than their chance of avoiding a breast-cancer death . I cant tell you if that is the right estimate ; since most everyone who receives a diagnosis of cancer is treated , overdiagnosis is rarely observed directly , so it is notoriously difficult to quantify . But I can tell you its in the ballpark . Our optimistic/pessimistic finding is this : Among a thousand 50-year-old American women screened annually for a decade , 3 to 14 will be overdiagnosed and overtreated .What about the benefit ? Among those thousand women , 3.2 to 0.3 will avoid a breast-cancer death . If you dont like decimals , call it 3 to 0 .The optimistic estimate reflects the most favorable result of the nine most comprehensive randomized trials of breast cancer screening . But these trials were initiated 20 to 50 years ago . Whether their results are still relevant is a question . Because of substantial improvements in breast cancer treatment , many cancers that would have been deadly 20 years ago now no longer are . The better we are able to treat cancer , the less important it is find it early ; in other words , there are fewer deaths for screening to help avoid . This is what is reflected in the pessimistic estimate . One study comparing regions with similar populations and health care systems , but different screening policies ( like Sweden versus Norway and Northern Ireland versus the Republic of Ireland ) , found that breast cancer death rates had declined at similar rates , regardless of when mass screening was adopted .So put it all together . Among a thousand 50-year-old American women screened annually for a decade , 3.2 to 0.3 will avoid a breast cancer death , 490 to 670 will have at least one false alarm and 3 to 14 will be overdiagnosed and treated needlessly . That may help some women choose whether to be screened or not . But its still not very precise , and it doesnt answer the fundamental question : Now that treatment is so much better , how much benefit does screening actually provide ? What we need is a clinical trial in the current treatment era .Two randomized trials could begin to answer the central question of mammography interpretation : How hard should the radiologist look ? Women who view mammography favorably might be willing to be screened under either the current approach or a high-threshold approach  meaning their radiologist would ignore small , likely harmless abnormalities found on a mammogram.Those who view it less favorably might choose that high-threshold approach ( knowing that the harms of false alarms and overdiagnosis would be minimized ) or forgo mammography completely .Putting the two trials together , we could finally learn what level of screening minimizes false alarms and overdiagnosis while saving the most lives . Most experts would say that its never going to happen . It would cost too much , take too long and need too many subjects .Maybe they are right . But maybe not . Sure , it would cost millions of dollars . But thats chicken feed compared with the billions of dollars we spend on breast cancer screening every year . Sure , it would take 10 to 15 years . But it would help our daughters know more . Sure , it would take tens of thousands of women to participate . But maybe they would want to be part of the effort to help sort out the morass surrounding what is one of the most common medical interventions done to American women .You never know , until you ask .None of this should dissuade women from seeking a diagnosis when they develop a new breast lump ( thats a form of early diagnosis we all agree on ) or from seeking treatment for a diagnosed breast cancer ( better treatment , not early detection , is the real success story in breast cancer ) . The uncertainties are about screening . Women who want to reduce those uncertainties will have to participate in trials ."
-1	"THIS week is the 50th anniversary of the publication of Betty Friedans international best seller , The Feminine Mystique ,  which has been widely credited with igniting the womens movement of the 1960s . Readers who return to this feminist classic today are often puzzled by the absence of concrete political proposals to change the status of women . But The Feminine Mystique had the impact it did because it focused on transforming womens personal consciousness .In 1963 , most Americans did not yet believe that gender equality was possible or even desirable . Conventional wisdom held that a woman could not pursue a career and still be a fulfilled wife or successful mother . Normal women , psychiatrists proclaimed , renounced all aspirations outside the home to meet their feminine need for dependence . In 1962 , more than two-thirds of the women surveyed by University of Michigan researchers agreed that most important family decisions should be made by the man of the house.It was in this context that Friedan set out to transform the attitudes of women . Arguing that the personal is political ,  feminists urged women to challenge the assumption , at work and at home , that women should always be the ones who make the coffee , watch over the children , pick up after men and serve the meals .Over the next 30 years this emphasis on equalizing gender roles at home as well as at work produced a revolutionary transformation in Americans attitudes . It was not instant . As late as 1977 , two-thirds of Americans believed that it was much better for everyone involved if the man is the achiever outside the home and the woman takes care of the home and family. By 1994 , two-thirds of Americans rejected this notion .But during the second half of the 1990s and first few years of the 2000s , the equality revolution seemed to stall . Between 1994 and 2004 , the percentage of Americans preferring the male breadwinner/female homemaker family model actually rose to 40 percent from 34 percent . Between 1997 and 2007 , the number of full-time working mothers who said they would prefer to work part time increased to 60 percent from 48 percent . In 1997 , a quarter of stay-at-home mothers said full-time work would be ideal . By 2007 , only 16 percent of stay-at-home mothers wanted to work full time . Womens labor-force participation in the United States also leveled off in the second half of the 1990s , in contrast to its continued increase in most other countries . Gender desegregation of college majors and occupations slowed . And although single mothers continued to increase their hours of paid labor , there was a significant jump in the percentage of married women , especially married women with infants , who left the labor force . By 2004 , a smaller percentage of married women with children under 3 were in the labor force than in 1993 .SOME people began to argue that feminism was not about furthering the equal involvement of men and women at home and work but simply about giving women the right to choose between pursuing a career and devoting themselves to full-time motherhood . A new emphasis on intensive mothering and attachment parenting helped justify the latter choice .Anti-feminists welcomed this shift as a sign that most Americans did not want to push gender equality too far . And feminists , worried that they were seeing a resurgence of traditional gender roles and beliefs , embarked on a new round of consciousness-raising . Books with titles like The Feminine Mistake and Get to Work warned of the stiff penalties women paid for dropping out of the labor force , even for relatively brief periods . Cultural critics questioned the Perfect Madness of intensive mothering and helicopter parenting , noting the problems that resulted when , as Ms. Friedan had remarked about housewifery ,  mothering expands to fill the time available.One study cautioned that nearly 30 percent of opt-out moms who wanted to rejoin the labor force were unable to do so , and of those who did return , only 40 percent landed full-time professional jobs . In The Price of Motherhood ,  the journalist Ann Crittenden estimated that the typical college-educated woman lost more than $ 1 million dollars in lifetime earnings and forgone retirement benefits after she opted out .Other feminists worried that the equation of feminism with an individual womans choice to opt out of the work force undermined the movements commitment to a larger vision of gender equity and justice . Joan Williams , the founding director of the Center for WorkLife Law at the University of Californias Hastings College of the Law , argued that defining feminism as giving mothers the choice to stay home assumes that their partners have the responsibility to support them , and thus denies choice to fathers . The political theorist Lori Marso noted that emphasizing personal choice ignores the millions of women without a partner who can support them ."
-1	"WASHINGTON  When the Supreme Court issued its latest campaign finance decision last month , the justices lined up in a familiar way . The five appointed by Republican presidents voted for the Republican National Committee , which was a plaintiff . The four appointed by Democrats dissented .That 5-to-4 split along partisan lines was by contemporary standards unremarkable . But by historical standards it was extraordinary . For the first time , the Supreme Court is closely divided along party lines .The partisan polarization on the court reflects similarly deep divisions in Congress , the electorate and the elite circles in which the justices move .The deep and often angry divisions among the justices are but a distilled version of the way American intellectuals  at think tanks and universities , in opinion journals and among the theorists and practitioners of law and politics  have separated into two groups with vanishingly little overlap or interaction . It is a recipe for dysfunction .The perception that partisan politics has infected the courts work may do lasting damage to its prestige and authority and to Americans faith in the rule of law .An undesirable consequence of the courts partisan divide ,  said Justin Driver , a law professor at the University of Texas , is that it becomes increasingly difficult to contend with a straight face that constitutional law is not simply politics by other means , and that justices are not merely politicians clad in fine robes . If that perception becomes pervasive among todays law students , who will become tomorrows judges , after all , it could assume a self-reinforcing quality.Presidents used to make nominations based on legal ability , to cater to religious or ethnic groups , to repay political favors or to reward friends . Even when ideology was their main concern , they often bet wrong .Three changes have created a courthouse made up of red and blue chambers . Presidents care more about ideology than they once did . They have become better at finding nominees who reliably vote according to that ideology . And party affiliation is increasingly the best way to predict the views of everyone from justices to bank tellers .It tells you more than gender , age , race or class , a 2012 Pew Research Center study found . And the gap between the parties is now larger than at any time in the surveys 25-year history .Polarization is higher than at any time Ive ever seen as a citizen or studied as a student of politics ,  said Kay L. Schlozman , a political scientist at Boston College .Supreme Court nominations were never immune from political considerations . But many factors used to play a role .That is why Republican presidents routinely appointed justices who were or would turn out to be liberals . Among them were Chief Justice Earl Warren and Justices William J. Brennan Jr. and Harry A. Blackmun .But it has been almost 25 years since the last such appointment , of Justice David H. Souter in 1990 . And it has been more than 50 years since a Democratic president last appointed a justice who often voted with the courts conservatives : Justice Byron R. White , who was nominated by President John F. Kennedy in 1962 .That timeline may suggest more ideological rigidity among Democratic presidents . But the number of opportunities played a role , too , as there have been twice as many Republican appointments since 1953 . And Republican justices were until recently more apt than Democratic ones to drift away from the positions of the presidents who appointed them .The new era arrived with the last retirement , in 2010 . Justice John Paul Stevens , a liberal appointed by President Gerald R. Ford , a Republican , left the court . Justice Elena Kagan , a liberal appointed by President Obama , arrived .Now , just as there is no Democratic senator who is more conservative than the most liberal Republican , there is no Democratic appointee on the Supreme Court who is more conservative than any Republican appointee . Its not coincidence ,  said Lawrence Baum , a political scientist at Ohio State , that the court is now divided along partisan lines in a way that hasnt been true.The partisan split is likely to deepen , said Neal Devins , a law professor at William & Mary and an author , along with Professor Baum , of a study examining , as its subtitle put it , how party polarization turned the Supreme Court into a partisan court.Consider , Professor Devins said , the eventual retirement of Justice Anthony M. Kennedy , a Republican appointee who sits at the courts ideological center and joins the courts four-member liberal wing about a third of the time when it divides along partisan lines .When Kennedy leaves ,  Professor Devins said , its going to move the court a whole , whole lot to the left , if the president is a Democrat , or slightly to the right , if its a Republican.THESE days , candidates for the court are groomed for decades and subjected to intense vetting . They are often affiliated with the networks of conservative or liberal lawyers that have replaced more neutral groups like bar associations . And they are drawn more than ever from federal appeals courts , where their views can be closely scrutinized .Confirmation battles have grown more partisan . With the exception of Justice Clarence Thomas , the five most senior members of the current court were confirmed easily , receiving an average of three negative votes . The four more recent nominees received an average of 33 .Once on the court , the justices surround themselves with like-minded law clerks , consume news reports that reinforce their views and appear before sympathetic audiences .In their public statements , the justices reject the idea that their work is influenced by politics . They point out that their decisions were unanimous almost half the time in the term that ended in June 2013 , and that the roughly 30 percent of 5-to-4 decisions did not all feature the classic alignments of Justice Kennedy joining either the courts conservative wing or its liberal one .But that was how most of the closely divided decisions came out . The conservatives won 10 times , including a decision striking down a core provision of the Voting Rights Act . The liberals won six times , including a ruling requiring the federal government to provide benefits to married same-sex couples .There are notable exceptions , of course , starting with Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. 's 2012 vote to uphold the heart of the Affordable Care Act .But standard political-science measurements of ideology , based on many thousands of votes , confirm the rise of a court divided on partisan lines .The very question of partisan voting hardly arose until 1937 , as dissents on the Supreme Court were infrequent . When the justices did divide , it was seldom along party lines .There is room for interpretation in such assessments . But of the 71 cases from 1790 to 1937 deemed important by a standard reference work and in which there were at least two dissenting votes , only one broke by party affiliation . The dividing line in the court was not a party line ,  Zechariah Chafee , a law professor at Harvard , wrote in a classic 1941 book .Nonpartisan voting patterns held true until 2010 , with a brief exception in the early 1940s , when a lone Republican appointee voted to the right of eight Democratic appointees . But the general trend was the same . Of the 311 cases listed as important from 1937 to 2010 with at least two dissents , only one of them , in 1985 , even arguably broke along party lines .That adds up to two cases in more than two centuries . By contrast , in just the last three terms , there were five major decisions that were closely divided along partisan lines : the ones on the Voting Rights Act , campaign finance , arbitration , immigration and strip-searches . In the current term , last months campaign finance ruling and Mondays decision on legislative prayer fit the pattern , too .MANY factors seem to contribute to partisan polarization on the court , including the people who work most closely with the justices .Every year , the justices each hire four recent law students , mostly from a handful of elite law schools . They consider grades , recommendations and , in recent years , a political marker .In the last nine terms , the courts current Republican appointees hired clerks who had first served for appeals court judges appointed by Republicans at least 83 percent of the time . Justice Thomas hired one clerk from a Democratic judges chambers , Justice Scalia none .The numbers on the other side are almost as striking . Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg , Sonia Sotomayor and Kagan hired from Democratic chambers more than two-thirds of the time . Justice Stephen G. Breyer is the exception : His hiring has long been about evenly divided .When law clerks move on , their career paths seem subject to the gravitational pull of ideology . Clerks for justices appointed by Democrats work for Democratic administrations , law firm practices headed by former Democratic officials and law schools dominated by liberals . Clerks for Republican appointees often go in the opposite directions .All of this is new , according to a detailed study in the Vanderbilt Law Review . The Supreme Court clerkship appeared to be a nonpartisan institution from the 1940s into the 1980s ,  it said .Like the rest of the country , the justices increasingly rely on sources of information that reinforce their views .We just get The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Times ,  Justice Scalia told New York magazine in September . He canceled his subscription to The Washington Post , he said , because it was slanted and often nasty and shrilly liberal. He said he did not read The New York Times either .I get most of my news , probably , driving back and forth to work , on the radio ,  he said . Talk guys , usually.Before the political and social culture of Washington grew polarized , most of the justices moved in a mixed and often liberal milieu . The social atmosphere in Washington had a role in the leftward movement of some of the justices ,  Professor Baum said .Those days are over , Justice Scalia said . When I was first in Washington , and even in my early years on this court , I used to go to a lot of dinner parties at which there were people from both sides ,  he said . Katharine Graham used to have dinner parties that really were quite representative of Washington . It doesnt happen anymore.In a recent 10-year period , the justices made around 1,000 public appearances for which their expenses were reimbursed , which generally means they were outside Washington . They almost certainly made at least as many local appearances . But their audiences varied . Justices Scalia , Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. have addressed the Federalist Society , a conservative group , while Justices Stevens , Ginsburg and Breyer spoke to the American Constitution Society , a liberal group . Justice Sotomayor is a featured speaker at its national convention next month .Justice Kagan , appearing before the Federalist Society in 2005 when she was dean of the Harvard Law School , said she admired its work . But , she added , you are not my people."
-1	"Cambridge , Mass .THERE must be an election coming up . I know this because of the number of times I have been getting a certain e-mail , one that begins , Take the three minutes to read this . Maybe he is wrong , but what if hes right ?  I first received the e-mail  which includes an essay railing against President Obama and the Federal Reserve  back in March 2009 , just weeks after the presidents inauguration . Since then , 267 people have e-mailed me about it ; about two dozen more have called my office to talk about it . A vast majority of them agree with the essays sentiments and want to compliment me for my work .The essay , which has been promoted on blogs across the Internet , is attributed to a person named David Kaiser . As it happens , my name is David Kaiser . We are not the same person . In fact , the e-mail states clearly that it was written by a historian and professor in the Strategy and Policy Department of the United States Naval War College. Some versions included a photo of this David Kaiser , taken from his Wikipedia entry . I teach physics and the history of science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , and my Web site includes a photograph of myself right next to my e-mail address . We look nothing alike .The essay includes a short curriculum vitae for the professor ( now retired from the Naval War College ) , the names of several of his books and his prior teaching appointments . Each of those items is true , except for one detail : that David Kaiser did not write it , either .After the false attribution , the essay launches into a tirade against the president that culminates in a comparison between him and Adolf Hitler . There are elementary flaws throughout  Winston Churchill never served in the British House of Lords , for one  piled on top of outlandish claims like the one that Mr. Obama promised to create and fund a mandatory civilian defense force stronger than our military for use inside our borders. In between are sneering gibes at religious minorities , schoolteachers and supporters of same-sex marriage .The rate at which the essay lands in my in-box follows the political news cycle . About one e-mail arrived each day during April and May 2009 , when the stimulus plan and the auto-industry bailout were in the headlines . Then the traffic fell by half until the pitched battles over the Affordable Care Act : I received about twice as many e-mails about the essay during September 2009 as I did at the peak period of the previous spring . Again there followed a brief quiescence until the Congressional election of 2010 . After each of those spikes , I foolishly thought that the episode had run its course . But no : with each new round of partisan finger-pointing in Washington , my in-box would fill up again .One concerned citizen wrote to me : I just got an e-mail that I believe you authored and I agree with every word . Now , what do we do to stop this ?  Another wrote , All I can say is keep up the good work until the brown shirts come along with a wide sweeping Fairness doctrine to shut you down. A year later one satisfied reader greeted me , Hello , soul mate !  This past July someone e-mailed to thank me for the essay , adding : It is time for people to speek [ sic ] out and voice their thoughts and findings on Obama . Facts are facts. Several correspondents have requested permission to reprint my essay in their local newspaper . Others clearly have had tastes that run beyond the mainstream media , like the reader who opined , this country has been under the control of satanic , antichrist powers  not government.I first wrote to the other David Kaiser about the essay at the end of March 2009 . He confirmed that he had not written it , either , that it absolutely did not represent his views , and that he was also being inundated . Neither of us had any idea how to get our names off it .By the first week of April 2009 , fact-checking Web sites like snopes.com had declared the essays attributed authorship to be bogus . According to Snopes , the real provenance of the essay was an anonymous comment on a blog . By that time , I had received precisely 11 e-mails about it . More than 250 e-mails arrived after it had been publicly declared a hoax . And thats what troubles me . The essay falls in a beguiling category : the zombie fact , claims that are shown to be untrue but which simply will not die ."
-1	"THE Postal Services announcement that it plans to end Saturday mail delivery reminds us of its vulnerability to the technological convulsions of the information age . The agency lost nearly $ 16 billion last year ; stopping Saturday delivery , starting in August , would save about $ 2 billion a year . To preserve the letter of the law , which requires six-day service , the agency would continue Saturday parcel delivery  a shrewd decision , since , thanks to booming e-commerce , the parcel business is one of the few sectors that is actually growing .Polls suggest that 7 in 10 Americans support the change , but a predictable outcry has emerged from members of Congress , labor unions , periodical publishers and direct-mail marketers . Other critics warn that ceasing Saturday service will be the first step down an irreversible death spiral.The controversy gets at a more fundamental question : Do we want the mail to remain a vital American institution in the digital age ?When Americans reflect on postal history , they almost always start with Benjamin Franklin . But Franklin had nothing to do with the modern institution that the founders established . It was George Washington and James Madison , not Franklin , who supported the key legislation that got the modern post office up and running in 1792 .By then Franklin had been dead for two years ; the post office he briefly oversaw in 1775-6 was basically a carbon copy of the British imperial post . The mandate of Franklins post office was narrow ; its primary rationale was to sustain the fledging revolutionary movement .In contrast , the Post Office Act of 1792 , with a broad civic mandate , vastly expanded the postal network while admitting newspapers into the mail at an extremely low rate . No less impressively , it guaranteed the sanctity of personal correspondence by protecting letters from the prying eyes of government . In a stroke , the founders provided the entire population with low-cost access to information on public affairs , while establishing a right to personal privacy .The results were astounding . Alexis de Tocqueville marveled at the skill with which postal administrators circulated hefty bundles of newspapers from New York and Philadelphia to the wilds of Detroit , then a thinly populated outpost on the western frontier . To his eyes , the post office was the only entity with the organizational capability to circulate the information of public significance that was essential to sustain Americas bold experiment with democracy . The German-born philosopher Francis Lieber called it an element of civilization  worthy of comparison with the printing press and the mariners compass .Saturday delivery started in 1863 , after the departure from Congress of anti-urban Southern states in rebellion . Northern legislators instituted free city delivery , thereby creating the modern letter carrier . Before then , Americans almost always picked up their mail at the post office  even on Sundays , if they wished  just as they can today if they rent a post office box .Of course , radio , television and the Internet have irrevocably altered our information-gathering habits , and the post office is no longer the wellspring of democracy it once was . The volume of first-class mail has long been declining as more Americans use e-mail and pay their bills online . Neither junk mail  bizarrely called standard mail in postal jargon  nor parcels have been able to pick up the slack .Though it still delivers millions of periodicals  whose low-cost circulation the founders would have heartily endorsed  and countless direct-mail solicitations for businesses , charities and political campaigns , very few Americans get their newspapers in the mail . Even so , by coordinating the circulation of billions of letters , parcels and even so-called junk mail , it helps sustain the social fabric .The millions of parcels that the Postal Service delivers reliably and at low cost provide a salutary check on the pricing policies of FedEx and U.P.S . Wonder why the lines at the post office are so long ? Its because it still provides a service at a cost no rival can match . ( Moreover , the agency already works with FedEx and U.P.S . to keep mail delivery affordable . In hundreds of cities and towns , it delivers the last mile parcels that FedEx and U.P.S . transport through their hub-and-spoke airborne networks . )Relatively few city dwellers go to the post office to pick up their mail , but in countless hamlets and small towns , the local post office remains a vital community center . For millions of workers , including veterans and African-Americans , a job at the post office has been a ticket to the middle class and has provided a pension and medical care to retirees . The Postal Service is the countrys second largest civilian employer , after Walmart .Postal correspondence is far more secure than e-mail and far less vulnerable to cyberattack . By capitalizing on its expertise in scheduling and high-volume sorting , the Postal Service has the potential to become a big platform for digital commerce . It helped pioneer optical character recognition , now a widely used technology . But Congress and regulations have frustrated the post office from issuing secure e-mail addresses and expanding by providing same-day service for digital retailers , for example , while obliging it to bankroll money-losing operations like six-day delivery .Postmaster General Patrick R. Donahoe announced in 2011 that the Postal Service would substantially reduce overnight delivery for first-class mail , considering closing up to 252 of 487 mail-processing facilities , make bookkeeping changes involving pensions and shrink the work force . Together with ending Saturday delivery , those steps might restore solvency by 2015 .In 1899 , Postmaster General Charles Emory Smith called the post office the greatest business concern in the world. He had it wrong . The post office is a public service with a civic mandate central to American business , society and civic culture  not a business . But if it is to survive , Congress must allow it to start acting like one ."
-1	"BRAD CRELIA was rushing around the vast media room at an international AIDS conference last summer in Washington , interviewing people for a series of articles on Hivster.com , a Web magazine he founded for people who are H.I.V . positive . The ease with which he moved through the crowd made it clear hed done this kind of political networking before : hed worked first as a field organizer for Hillary Rodham Clinton and later as a regional field organizer for President Obama .But Mr. Crelia , 27 , nearly didnt make it home from the AIDS conference ; without the $ 17 necessary to buy a bus ticket , hed had to beg a stranger for a ride back to New York . It was the end of the month , he said . Hed simply run out of money .He is one of more than 8.7 million disabled Americans who rely on cash assistance from the government through a program called Supplemental Security Income . The program was created in 1974 to help blind , aged and disabled people meet basic needs for food , clothing and shelter . By 2035 , the federal government expects to spend $ 60.9 billion in payments to 9.9 million people .Discussion of Medicare , Medicaid and Social Security programs has been at the forefront of election-year debate . But there has been no discussion of S.S.I . The fact is that expenditures for the S.S.I . program are rising while the economic status of disabled people is on the decline .The very program that is supposed to be their safety net is actually the source of the problem , experts say . S.S.I . traps many disabled people by limiting their income to levels just above the poverty line , and taking away their cash benefits if they achieve any level of security .At 16 , Mr. Crelia was given a diagnosis of porphyria , an incurable hereditary blood disorder . His symptoms  seizures , paralysis , blackouts , nausea and extreme pain  became more and more severe , preventing him from finishing college and landing him in the hospital for days or weeks at a time . In addition , in 2009 , he learned he had H.I.V . That has not affected his ability to work . But his porphyria has made maintaining a traditional full-time job nearly impossible .So he and others like him need a flexible financial safety net for the periods during which they can not work . But no such program exists . The only way for Mr. Crelia to qualify for cash assistance was to sign up for S.S.I .  and demonstrate that he was unable to engage in substantial gainful activity because of his physical impairment .He now receives a monthly check for $ 506 through the S.S.I . program , and he is allowed to earn $ 85 more . ( He also receives some assistance toward his rent and food expenses . ) Once he surpasses the $ 85 , his benefit check will be reduced by $ 1 for every $ 2 he earns . And if his income reaches $ 1,097 a month , he will no longer be eligible for any cash S.S.I . benefits at all . So he must be poor or he must give up all government support . Mr. Crelia is never permitted to have more than $ 2,000 in the bank , a restriction that places the trappings of a middle-class life  a car , a modest home , a family  far out of reach .Ive been kept financially sort of in this cage ,  Mr. Crelia said . Just basic things that people rely upon , having a normal life , arent things that are really accessible . And wont be.People like Mr. Crelia  ill , but ambitious , motivated and able to work the majority of the time  dont fit into a rigid system set up primarily to provide support for those who will never be able to enter the workplace in any capacity . Instead of accounting for a spectrum of ability and administering a benefits package accordingly , the system offers a one-size-fits-all plan : you can either work and not qualify for financial assistance , or youre sick , and barred from earning any substantial income .Instead of helping people achieve their full potential ,  David Stapleton , who directs the Mathematica Center for Studying Disability Policy , testified before Congress last month , the current disability support system has created a poverty trap. The employment rate for people with disabilities , he said , is just 21 percent of the rate for people without disabilities , down from 32 percent in 1981 . The problems stem from the Social Security Administrations failure in 1974 to structure a program that motivates work . It is relatively easy to accept cash benefits but very hard to get into the workplace . Mr. Stapleton said that Congress had the power to push to change the structure of the program , but that it had not done so .Today , 70 percent of people with disabilities live in poverty . The Affordable Care Act may eventually ease the burden for some individuals with disabilities , namely those who rely on Medicaid through the S.S.I . program , by eliminating exclusions based on pre-existing conditions and annual or lifetime benefits caps . But the impact on the disabled is not yet clear , and experts are calling for additional targeted reforms .Richard Burkhauser , a professor at Cornell , and Mary Daly , a government economist , have studied the welfare of people with disabilities for more than three decades , and offer some solutions . They suggest a work-first approach that would help people get job training or employment before they go through the red-tape-ridden path of getting on S.S.I . Now people must go through the lengthy process of proving that they can not work before they are given access to job training and other programs .Instead of enrolling Mr. Crelia in S.S.I. , the Social Security Administration could have helped him apply for a loan to finish his bachelors degree , increasing his chances of finding a flexible , high-paying job with health insurance .Mr. Burkhauser and Ms. Daly borrow another idea from the lessons learned from the 1996 welfare overhaul . Welfare moved from a federal program that did not encourage single mothers to work to a state-run program that offered the incentive of an earned-income tax credit for working mothers . They say S.S.I . should copy this model by allowing people like Mr. Crelia to hold a paying job as often as possible  whether for 20 , 25 or 30 hours a week  and having the federal or state government chip in with tax credits to round out his income .For now , Mr. Crelia is doing his best to stay busy . He clocks far more than 40 hours most weeks , mostly in unpaid writing . When I work , I thrive both physically and emotionally ,  Mr. Crelia said . When I am not sick and can control my disease with medication  like now  I want to be able to contribute to society , have a family , grow my business . But not as a volunteer ; I want to be paid like everyone else."
-1	"THE chicken salad hero at Lennys , a chain in New York , has 213 more calories than the tuna salad on the same kind of bread . I did no research to bring you this information . On the big menu board at the Lennys around the corner from me , where I sometimes grab a perfunctory lunch , the calorie counts of every item are clearly posted . The city made this mandatory for such restaurants about five years ago , hoping that informed gluttons might be reformed gluttons : that if we had more knowledge about where our efforts to slim down were going wrong , wed have more power to change them .And yet four out of every five lunches at Lennys , I get the chicken salad , all 879 calories of it , because theres something more persuasive than nutritional data . Its called mayonnaise . I can taste it in the chicken salad but not in the leaner tuna , partly explaining the extra damage  and the exaggerated sirens call  of the former . The stomach wants what it wants , even if the love handles pay a pendulous price for it .McMuffin by McMuffin , Frosty by Frosty , we Americans are waddling toward the moment when calorie counts like the ones at Lennys are posted in every chain restaurant across the nation . Starbucks , which already advertises such information in cities that require it , announced last week that it would do so throughout the country before the end of this month , a recognition that the clock was ticking anyway . As part of the Affordable Care Act , any restaurant in America with at least 20 locations must follow Starbuckss lead , perhaps next year . ( The precise date hasnt been fixed . )Soon enough , those of us taking in more calories than we should be and wearing pants roomier than wed like to wont be able to say we werent told . But is ignorance really our enemy , or are appetite , compulsion and ingrained habit the chief culprits ?These arent just idle questions but matters of immediate relevance in the war against obesity , the stakes of which were just raised . On the same day last week that Starbucks made its announcement , the American Medical Association voted to classify obesity as a disease . This means that in the eyes of the largest physicians group in the United States , the roughly 90 million Americans who are formally considered obese  thats about 30 percent of the population  arent just in imperfect health . Theyre downright ill , and we need to heal them .Calorie postings are one of public health officials attempts to do that . The results so far arent especially encouraging .Brian Elbel , a population-health expert at New York Universitys school of medicine , examined fast-food receipts from four chains in New York both before the city law went into effect and after , to see if customers were altering their orders to reduce the calories they consumed per visit to the restaurants . He found no meaningful difference , and his subsequent research in Philadelphia , which in 2010 implemented a mandate like New Yorks , echoes and bolsters that conclusion .Its becoming increasingly clear that nothing big is happening for a large group of people ,  Elbel told me .Other evidence isnt quite so grim . New York City commissioned a broader survey than Elbels , looking at thousands of receipts from 11 chains . At three of them  Au Bon Pain , KFC and McDonalds  there was proof of calorie reductions after the law . But at seven there wasnt , and at Subway , which was promoting footlong sandwiches for $ 5 during the post-law survey period , calorie consumption per visit actually increased .The effect of calorie counts is beneficial ,  Thomas Farley , the citys health commissioner , said during a phone interview on Friday . But its small and somewhat spotty and can be overwhelmed by the marketing of the restaurant.Yet another study , confined to Starbucks stores in New York , noted a 6 percent decrease in customers intake of calories after the posting began . But it also suggested some vexing limitations to the impact of advertised calorie counts .Calorie reductions were highest in high-income , high-education neighborhoods ( where we believe obesity rates to be lower ) ,  Phillip Leslie , one of the studys authors , said to me in an e-mail . On top of which , the Starbucks customers as an overall group were more affluent than the fast-food customers whose unchanged behavior Elbel evaluated . It raises a very important concern ,  said Leslie , an economist at the University of California , Los Angeles . The people who tend to be most responsive to information may be those we least aim to target.BRYAN BOLLINGER , who also worked on that study , drew my attention to something else in it . For the most part , Starbucks customers ordering sugary , creamy coffee beverages kept on doing so , seemingly because they had already figured that the drinks were fattening and had made a flabby peace with that . But customers indeed adjusted their food orders upon realizing that a pastry could easily exceed 400 calories . They hadnt bargained on , or planned for , that .What really matters is what your prior beliefs are ,  said Bollinger , who teaches marketing at New York Universitys Stern School of Business .What also matters is how much of a nudge youre given .Cheryl Healton , the dean of global public health at New York University , told me that education and information could be effective in influencing a discrete , relatively easy behavior , like persuading someone to get vaccinated .But when its habitual and even addictive behavior , youre in a whole new ballgame ,  she said .Healton , an authority on tobacco use in particular , noted that the principal reasons for the remarkable decrease in smoking in New York City and elsewhere over the last few decades werent ominous commercials and warning labels . They were taxes and the bans on indoor smoking . People kicked the habit when it became onerous , in cost and convenience , not to .Farley , the health commissioner , agreed . The structural things were more effective for smoking than the information was ,  he said . And that  not any itch to play nanny  is why he and Mayor Michael Bloomberg support such measures as new taxes on sodas , which may never happen , and a ban on sugary drinks over 16 ounces , which is in legal limbo .We should certainly continue to give posted calorie counts a whirl . Even a tiny impact is better than none . But we also need a more forceful kick in our amply cushioned rears . Were not as plump as we are because weve never had our eyes opened to the wages of a Whopper . Were this way because its all too easy , in a pang of hunger and collapse of resolve , to turn a blind eye to the toll . I know whereof I speak . My neighborhood Lennys does , too ."
-1	"WHEN a federal judge recently ordered the Food and Drug Administration to make the morning-after pill available to women of all ages without a prescription , the ruling was a political embarrassment for the Obama administration and unleashed protests from abortion foes and abstinence advocates . But that controversy may look like a tempest in a teapot compared with a broader and no less heated discussion that is roiling the medical community : should birth-control pills of any type require a doctors prescription ? Or should they be available , like Tylenol , on pharmacy shelves ?Last December the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists released an official position paper concluding that the time had come for birth-control pills to be sold over the counter . It was the first time the group had endorsed such sales , concluding that scientific evidence suggested that the practice was safe and calling it a potential way to improve contraceptive access and use , and possibly decrease the unintended pregnancy rate.After all , oral contraceptives have been available in the United States for more than half a century , and few medicines have been so thoroughly vetted . Despite some catchy new brand names , the pills I took 25 years ago are essentially the same as those my daughter takes today . If anything , pills have become safer because they contain lower doses of estrogen .While oral contraceptives bring with them some tiny risks , especially if used improperly , they arguably pose fewer dangers than many other medicines bought freely at the pharmacy , experts say , including nonsteroidal pain pills like Motrin ( which can cause stomach bleeding ) and decongestants like Sudafed ( which may raise blood pressure ) . With a simple packaging insert about proper use and precautions , women would be fully capable of using them safely , the gynecologists group maintained .Nonsteroidal medicines kill far more people than birth-control pills ,  said Dr. Eve Espey , a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of New Mexico , who was involved in writing the position paper . For most women , the absolute risk of taking the pill is far less than the risks incurred in pregnancy.The goal of the proposal , of course , is to make birth-control pills more readily available . The biggest barrier to adherence is the logistics of a prescription  you run out on a Saturday night , you lose your pills , you go on vacation , you cant get a doctors appointment ,  said Daniel Grossman , a gynecologist who is a vice president at Ibis Reproductive Health , a nonprofit research organization .In his groups studies , about one-third of the women who were using no birth control or a less effective method said they would use the pill if it were available without a prescription . This is what women want ,  Dr. Grossman added .But pregnancy , prescriptions and religious politics form a combustible mix in the United States , and Lo/Ovral is not likely to be next to the Tylenol anytime soon .While womens health advocates gleefully called the American Colleges endorsement a game changer in the quest for over-the-counter sales of birth-control pills , members of the Catholic Medical Association lambasted the idea .Gynecologists themselves seem divided on the issue . A recent poll found that a majority of gynecologists and family doctors in training opposed the practice , worried mainly about safety . The researchers at the University of Missouri who conducted the survey concluded that the fear was irrational , revealing a knowledge deficit about the safety of oral contraceptives.But Dr. Donna Harrison , executive director of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists , said her group believed that it was foolish to make these medicines available over the counter because of the potential for misuse and also because the practice served to abandon and isolate younger women who needed a doctors counsel . She cited studies showing that women who had ready access to over-the-counter emergency contraception had higher rates of sexually transmitted diseases .The political response has been even more topsy-turvy . Gov . Bobby Jindal of Louisiana , a Republican who opposes abortion , endorsed the American Colleges proposal , saying that contraception was a personal issue .Meanwhile , the F.D.A . will not comment on the idea because of the ongoing legal issues concerning the judicial ruling on the morning-after pill , Plan B , said Stephanie Yao , a spokeswoman . The morning-after pill , also known as emergency contraception , contains the same hormones as some birth-control pills , though delivered in a short blast and higher dose .That legal dispute has highlighted the Obama administrations hair splitting over the sensitive issue of contraceptive policy . Even though F.D.A . doctors said in 2011 that studies showed that it was safe to sell Plan B , the most common emergency contraceptive , to adolescents over the counter , the administration refused to approve the practice . ( It was already available to older women . ) That set the stage for the ruling earlier this month by Judge Edward R. Korman of the Eastern District of New York , who called the administrations action politically motivated and scientifically unjustified  essentially an attempt to appease religious conservatives .Politics aside , there are procedural hurdles to clear before packs of birth-control pills can be sold without prescription . First of all , a drug maker would most likely have to apply to the F.D.A . to make the switch . At the very least , that would involve serious investment in studies to show that patients could understand labels and use the pills as directed . And over-the-counter sales could upend drug company profits . After all , some oral prescription contraceptives sell for close to $ 100 a month , with insurers paying the bulk of the costs , while generic pills cost under $ 10 .Dr. Espey said gynecologists might resist for financial reasons as well , since young women often visit the gynecologist annually solely for the purpose of getting a contraceptive prescription . ( Pap smears , which used to be recommended once a year , are now advised only once every three . ) They worry that if patients can go to the pharmacy and get their pills , they will have fewer visits ,  she said .As for safety , the most common birth-control pill  which combines progestin with a low dose of estrogen  poses a very slightly elevated risk of blood clots and a few other conditions . But that is mostly for certain groups of women , including those with high blood pressure or those who are over 35 and smoke , for example ( these women are advised not use them ) . But warnings could be conveyed in package labeling , just as patients with a history of ulcers are advised not to take certain pain medications . And a few alternative birth-control pills that contain only progestin are generally safe for all .So far the debate has been argued in black and white . But there is , in fact , a middle ground : many countries that allow pharmacies to sell birth-control pills require that a pharmacist screen women for contraindications with a few simple questions .My daughter spends hundreds of dollars a year for a gynecologists visit to obtain a prescription for the same pill I got a quarter-century earlier . She goes through elaborate machinations to get them if she runs out while away on a summer job . The Affordable Care Act of 2010 seeks to improve access to the pills by eventually eliminating patient copays when prescriptions are filled . But many doctors think it would be even smarter to just eliminate the prescription ."
-1	"It was an anachronistic , even silly debaters point . New York Times v. Sullivan , decided in 1964 , and the 1971 Pentagon Papers decision ( New York Times v. United States ) of course predated the Supreme Courts current infatuation with corporate speech and had nothing to do with the fact that newspaper publishing companies are corporations . It was the medias role in American society , not organizational format of the publishers executive suite , that the justices found worthy of constitutional protection in these and other First Amendment decisions .Justice Alito , addressing a Federalist Society banquet in Washington , went on to question why certain preferred corporations , namely those media organizations should be accorded a favored position in the First Amendment pantheon . This may have been red meat for his conservative audience , but whatever Justice Alitos intent , it was far from a silly point . It was a serious one , and behind it , as he went on to suggest , lies a profound question : what , today , is the press anyway ? Its a question without a simple answer , either in todays chaotic and rapidly changing media landscape or in Supreme Court doctrine .The First Amendment prohibits Congress ( and , by later interpretive expansion , the states ) from abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press. Do the dual references to speech and press amount to one and the same , or does the amendment place the press in a special position , with rights not accorded to other speakers ? The Supreme Court has never fully resolved this question .As Lee C. Bollinger , a First Amendment scholar who is president of Columbia University , notes in his recent book , Uninhibited , Robust , and Wide-Open : A Free Press for a New Century ,  whether the press is just another speaker or a constitutionally favored one has been a matter of active debate on the court . Justice Potter Stewart wrote in 1975 that the Constitutions framers must have meant to protect the press as an institution , because if the Free Press guarantee meant no more than freedom of expression , it would be a constitutional redundancy. But those words appeared in a law review article , not a Supreme Court opinion , and the court has generally not followed the path that Justice Stewart marked out .Potter Stewart retired from the court in 1981 , a generation ago , before blogs and links and Web sites , when news was printed on paper and it was much easier to have a discussion about the press. A fascinating example of just how tricky the definitional question has become is playing out these days in the Supreme Court pressroom .Since its founding 10 years ago , the Web site Scotusblog ( Scotus being the standard abbreviation for Supreme Court of the United States ) has become the go-to place for people interested in following the court regularly and in close to real time . And there are a lot of such people out there . On June 28 , the day the court handed down its decision in the Affordable Care Act case , the site received 5.3 million page views from one million unique users . Furthermore , unlike some more traditional media outlets , Scotusblog was error-free in promptly parsing and conveying the details of the complex decision . Its publisher , Tom Goldstein , later described the effort the site expended in covering that memorable day , in a riveting 7,000-word account that deserves a place in the how-to-do-journalism canon .Scotusblog covers the little decisions as well as the big ones . Its reporter , Lyle Denniston , draws on his 54 years of experience in covering the court ( yes , 54 , thats not a typographical error ) to offer astute analysis of pending cases , arguments and decisions . Other staff members sift through the more than 100 new cases that reach the court each week in order to highlight the petitions to watch at the justices weekly conference . The courts agenda-setting function is one of its most important and least transparent , yet the Supreme Courts own Web site doesnt post petitions . Scotusblog does , selectively , providing an invaluable service to anyone following the court from outside the building  as well as to many Supreme Court reporters whom the Scotusblog list saves from having to plow through the weekly pile of petitions on their own . Two years ago , Scotusblog won the American Bar Associations Silver Gavel Award for media that contribute to increased public understanding of law .Twenty-seven news organizations have permanent credentials to cover the Supreme Court . Remarkably , Scotusblog is not one of them .How can this be ? Were back to the definitional problem . The courts public information office gives a permanent press pass only to reporters who already have credentials from the Senate Press Gallery or the White House ( and the White House , in turn , makes Senate press credentials a prerequisite for a White House press pass ) . Over the years , Scotusblog has inquired about getting Congressional credentials but has been told not to bother even submitting a formal application . Tom Goldstein and his wife , Amy Howe , started Scotusblog as a way of attracting clients to their law practice , and the link between the blog and the law firm was disqualifying under the Senate Press Gallerys rules .The blogs reporter at the court , Mr. Denniston , happens to have a Congressional credential through WBUR , the Boston NPR station , which grants him eligibility for a Supreme Court permanent press pass and the access and work space in the courts press room that come with it . Some 1,000 reporters from around the country each year receive daily passes to cover individual cases , but these day passes come without guaranteed access to work space or an unobstructed view of the bench from the tight press quarters along the side of the courtroom . Even these temporary passes require a credential from somewhere , or some other proof of a bona fide press affiliation . For people without a pass , the press room itself is off limits . My friend Lyle Denniston is 81 years old . Without his WBUR affiliation , he would be out of luck , and its unclear whether , if he ever retires , Scotusblog would be able to arrange any kind of press room access .Change may just possibly be in the wind , however . Last year , Scotusblog came under the wing of Bloomberg , a properly credentialed if nontraditional news organization that is now the sites official sponsor . I talked this week to Joe Keenan , who runs the Senate Press Gallery , to ask him whether the reconfigured Scotusblog might qualify . Quite possibly , he answered . Wed look at them all over again ,  he said , noting that the gallery has changed substantially since my own brief stint covering Congress in the mid-1980s . We have all kinds of different permutations now ,  Mr. Keenan said , adding that the 24-hour news cycle has brought more journalists to Congress than ever before . The daily press gallery now accredits 1,800 reporters representing some 400 organizations , including a number of online-only publications .Nothing is too small to cover these days ,  Mr Keenan mused . Like what ? I asked . We had a bird fly in the window the other day ,  he replied , nearly choking with laughter , and sure enough , someone wrote a story about it."
-1	"A TYPICAL American school day finds some six million high school students and two million college freshmen struggling with algebra . In both high school and college , all too many students are expected to fail . Why do we subject American students to this ordeal ? Ive found myself moving toward the strong view that we shouldnt .My question extends beyond algebra and applies more broadly to the usual mathematics sequence , from geometry through calculus . State regents and legislators  and much of the public  take it as self-evident that every young person should be made to master polynomial functions and parametric equations .There are many defenses of algebra and the virtue of learning it . Most of them sound reasonable on first hearing ; many of them I once accepted . But the more I examine them , the clearer it seems that they are largely or wholly wrong  unsupported by research or evidence , or based on wishful logic . ( Im not talking about quantitative skills , critical for informed citizenship and personal finance , but a very different ballgame . )This debate matters . Making mathematics mandatory prevents us from discovering and developing young talent . In the interest of maintaining rigor , were actually depleting our pool of brainpower . I say this as a writer and social scientist whose work relies heavily on the use of numbers . My aim is not to spare students from a difficult subject , but to call attention to the real problems we are causing by misdirecting precious resources .The toll mathematics takes begins early . To our nations shame , one in four ninth graders fail to finish high school . In South Carolina , 34 percent fell away in 2008-9 , according to national data released last year ; for Nevada , it was 45 percent . Most of the educators Ive talked with cite algebra as the major academic reason .Shirley Bagwell , a longtime Tennessee teacher , warns that to expect all students to master algebra will cause more students to drop out. For those who stay in school , there are often exit exams ,  almost all of which contain an algebra component . In Oklahoma , 33 percent failed to pass last year , as did 35 percent in West Virginia .Algebra is an onerous stumbling block for all kinds of students : disadvantaged and affluent , black and white . In New Mexico , 43 percent of white students fell below proficient ,  along with 39 percent in Tennessee . Even well-endowed schools have otherwise talented students who are impeded by algebra , to say nothing of calculus and trigonometry .Californias two university systems , for instance , consider applications only from students who have taken three years of mathematics and in that way exclude many applicants who might excel in fields like art or history . Community college students face an equally prohibitive mathematics wall . A study of two-year schools found that fewer than a quarter of their entrants passed the algebra classes they were required to take .There are students taking these courses three , four , five times ,  says Barbara Bonham of Appalachian State University . While some ultimately pass , she adds , many drop out.Another dropout statistic should cause equal chagrin . Of all who embark on higher education , only 58 percent end up with bachelors degrees . The main impediment to graduation : freshman math . The City University of New York , where I have taught since 1971 , found that 57 percent of its students didnt pass its mandated algebra course . The depressing conclusion of a faculty report : failing math at all levels affects retention more than any other academic factor. A national sample of transcripts found mathematics had twice as many Fs and Ds compared as other subjects .Nor will just passing grades suffice . Many colleges seek to raise their status by setting a high mathematics bar . Hence , they look for 700 on the math section of the SAT , a height attained in 2009 by only 9 percent of men and 4 percent of women . And its not just Ivy League colleges that do this : at schools like Vanderbilt , Rice and Washington University in St. Louis , applicants had best be legacies or athletes if they have scored less than 700 on their math SATs ."
-1	"GREENWICH , Conn.The Dow Jones and Standard & Poors 500 indexes reached record highs on Thursday , having completely erased the losses since the stock markets last peak , in 2007 . But instead of cheering , we should be very afraid .Over the last 13 years , the stock market has twice crashed and touched off a recession : American households lost $ 5 trillion in the 2000 dot-com bust and more than $ 7 trillion in the 2007 housing crash . Sooner or later  within a few years , I predict  this latest Wall Street bubble , inflated by an egregious flood of phony money from the Federal Reserve rather than real economic gains , will explode , too .Since the S. & P . 500 first reached its current level , in March 2000 , the mad money printers at the Federal Reserve have expanded their balance sheet sixfold ( to $ 3.2 trillion from $ 500 billion ) . Yet during that stretch , economic output has grown by an average of 1.7 percent a year ( the slowest since the Civil War ) ; real business investment has crawled forward at only 0.8 percent per year ; and the payroll job count has crept up at a negligible 0.1 percent annually . Real median family income growth has dropped 8 percent , and the number of full-time middle class jobs , 6 percent . The real net worth of the bottom 90 percent has dropped by one-fourth . The number of food stamp and disability aid recipients has more than doubled , to 59 million , about one in five Americans .So the Main Street economy is failing while Washington is piling a soaring debt burden on our descendants , unable to rein in either the warfare state or the welfare state or raise the taxes needed to pay the nations bills . By default , the Fed has resorted to a radical , uncharted spree of money printing . But the flood of liquidity , instead of spurring banks to lend and corporations to spend , has stayed trapped in the canyons of Wall Street , where it is inflating yet another unsustainable bubble .When it bursts , there will be no new round of bailouts like the ones the banks got in 2008 . Instead , America will descend into an era of zero-sum austerity and virulent political conflict , extinguishing even todays feeble remnants of economic growth .THIS dyspeptic prospect results from the fact that we are now state-wrecked . With only brief interruptions , weve had eight decades of increasingly frenetic fiscal and monetary policy activism intended to counter the cyclical bumps and grinds of the free market and its purported tendency to underproduce jobs and economic output . The toll has been heavy .As the federal government and its central-bank sidekick , the Fed , have groped for one goal after another  smoothing out the business cycle , minimizing inflation and unemployment at the same time , rolling out a giant social insurance blanket , promoting homeownership , subsidizing medical care , propping up old industries ( agriculture , automobiles ) and fostering new ones ( clean energy , biotechnology ) and , above all , bailing out Wall Street  they have now succumbed to overload , overreach and outside capture by powerful interests . The modern Keynesian state is broke , paralyzed and mired in empty ritual incantations about stimulating demand ,  even as it fosters a mutant crony capitalism that periodically lavishes the top 1 percent with speculative windfalls .The culprits are bipartisan , though youd never guess that from the blather that passes for political discourse these days . The state-wreck originated in 1933 , when Franklin D. Roosevelt opted for fiat money ( currency not fundamentally backed by gold ) , economic nationalism and capitalist cartels in agriculture and industry .Under the exigencies of World War II ( which did far more to end the Depression than the New Deal did ) , the state got hugely bloated , but remarkably , the bloat was put into brief remission during a midcentury golden era of sound money and fiscal rectitude with Dwight D. Eisenhower in the White House and William McChesney Martin Jr. at the Fed ."
-1	"So Chris Christie says that Obamacare is a failure on a number of levels . Which levels , exactly ?I mean , first-year enrollment is above projections . The number of Americans without insurance has dropped sharply . Costs appear to be lower than expected , and more broadly cost control on health seems to be doing remarkably well:To some extent I suspect that Christie is living in the bubble ; I keep remembering how Rand Paul was shocked and disbelieving at the proposition that government employment had fallen under Obama , even though all it takes to know that is a quick look at public data .But its not just misinformation ; the reality doesnt matter for Christie , or Republicans in general . Just as tax cuts can never fail , programs that help the unlucky can never succeed ."
-1	"One of the odd rituals of American punditry  the most famous example is Karl Roves tantrum in 2012 , but it happens all the time  is the way pundits and operatives keep spinning after the polls have closed . Never mind the vote totals , and lets dispute the network projections ; my guy is still winning !The obvious question is , whats the point ? The votes are already in ; you cant build momentum , or attract more donations , or any of those other things that claims of imminent victory might do . Wouldnt election night be a good time to adopt the persona of hard-headed realist , not delusional wishful thinker ? Yet this hardly ever happens .Something like this is going on with Obamacare . Not a day goes by without some prominent Republican politician or pundit insisting that the enrollment numbers are phony , that more people are losing insurance than gaining it , etc.. I know thats what the base believes , because its what they hear from Rush and Fox . But you would think that important people would have someone around who has a clue , who knows that enrollment data and multiple surveys are all telling the same story of unexpected success . OK , maybe not  if famous senators dont have anyone to clue them in about BLS data , they might really still be living in the bubble . But thats really their choice .And the point is that with enrollment more or less closed for 2014 , theres not much point in spinning . OK , maybe if you can keep up the pretense all the way to November , you can slightly sway base voters for the midterms . But even thats doubtful  by the fall , were going to have a very clear picture of how things went ; and the shape of that picture has already been determined .I guess that what gets me is the  to use the technical term  wussiness of it all . Isnt there any space on the right for people who sell themselves as tough-minded , who condemn Obamacare on principle but warn their followers that its not on the verge of collapse ? Is the whole party so insecure , so unable to handle the truth , that it automatically shoots anyone bearing bad news ?And the answer appears to be yes ."
-1	"Just a quick note in support of government statisticians . They do an incredibly important job , and by and large do it very well . Theyve also maintained a well-deserved reputation for staying out of the political fray , of acting as civil servants , not party apparatchiks .You can argue that the Census decision to change its health-insurance questionnaire starting with the 2013 data wasnt such a good idea  in fact , I know a number of health care experts who are dismayed . But its really quite vile to have talk-show hosts who quite literally know nothing about the field , other than that theyre against covering the uninsured , casually accusing Census of cooking the books to support Obamacare .But remember , MSNBC is the liberal network , right ? Why dont they just hire Donald Trump and be done with it ?"
-1	"If youve been tracking the news on signups under the Affordable Care Act  which is easy thanks to Charles Gabas invaluable site  you already knew that the program was making a pretty good recovery from the botched start . Now , however , its official : as of the end of January signups were only about a million behind their projected track as of last spring , which means that as of March 31 the total is likely to be 6-point-something million rather than the projected 7 million . In other words , basically OK .But heres the thing : every online article Ive seen about the latest numbers is followed by a huge number of vitriolic comments insisting that it isnt true , that Obamacare is a total disaster . Some commenters declare that all the numbers are lies ; others , getting their take from right-wing bloggers , say that all of those who have signed up but not yet paid their first premium  ahem , 47 percent of the total  will never pay and are fake enrollees . And so on .You cant help but notice the resemblance to the unskewing fever of the final weeks of the 2012 election , when everyone on the right knew , just knew , that the polls showing a clear Obama edge were biased and wrong , and that if you reworked the numbers somehow they pointed to a Romney triumph .Now , you might ask , how do I know that the Obamacare unskewers are wrong ? Actually , I dont know that for sure  but its very unlikely that theyre right . For one thing , they are more or less the same as the poll unskewers  people who know nothing about the subject , but know what they want to believe . For another , CBO  which has a reputation to defend  thinks its going to be OK . Finally , the insurers , who have real money on the line , seem fairly calm , which wouldnt be the case if they saw really terrible enrollment .Two things are interesting about all of this . First , the right has evidently learned nothing from the unskewing debacle . And second , right-wingers are totally vested in the idea of an Obamacare collapse . They have no plan B , and their only answer to growing evidence that its not going to happen is furious denial ."

-1	"The Commonwealth Fund has a new study out on Obamacare enrollment , estimating that about 9.5 million people gained coverage through Medicaid and the exchanges ; this is roughly in line with some previous estimates but perhaps slightly more encouraging for the laws supporters . Jonathan Cohn uses the estimate to declare that the law is meeting expectations in covering the uninsured: The Congressional Budget Office predicted that , one year into full implementation , Obamacare would reduce the the number of Americans without insurance by 12 million . That included the young adults who got insurance before 2014 , by signing onto their parents plans . Theres been some controversy over exactly how many more young people are insured because of that new option , but the best estimates Ive seen place the number somewhere between 1 and 2.5 million . Add that number to the 9.5 million from the Commonwealth survey , and youre close or equal to the CBO projections .Of course , the Commonwealth survey has a hefty margin of error and the CBO projections , revised to take account of the early technological problems on Obamacare websites , were never that scientific . But the figures seem to be in the same ballpark . Thats what matters .In broad strokes , this is plausible : Obamacare has stabilized , its insuring substantial numbers of people , the disaster scenarios have been averted and most people getting coverage seem reasonably happy with it . I would only offer the caveat that when Cohn says in the same ballpark ,  he means in the same ballpark , but probably lower than what was hoped for , which in turn was lower than what was originally projected. That is , if the Commonwealth figure is right were probably looking at between 10 and 11 million newly-insured overall for 2014 ( Im relying on best estimates for the number of young adults that are slightly lower than Cohns ) , which is lower than the 12 million the C.B.O . projected in April , which is lower than the 13 million it projected after the website problems , which is lower than the 14 million it projected after the Supreme Court decision on Medicaid , which is lower  you get the idea .All of which means that this new estimate , while useful , doesnt really bring us any closer to knowing whether Obamacare enrollment will ultimately end up where its advocates hoped  making up ground lost during the disastrous roll-out over the next couple of years , and hitting 25-30 million newly insured by 2017 or so  or whether its current shortfalls will persist and it will end up many millions below that target .With that being said , there are other recent numbers  the surprising downward revisions on overall health care spending ( albeit revisions associated with a terrible first quarter for the economy ) , the continued downward trajectory of Medicare costs  that make it seem a little more likely that Obamacare will end up passing a different test on my recent what count as success list , by producing less in the way of health care cost inflation than its critics have expected . And if you throw in the suggestive data on health outcomes from the recent Massachusetts study , I think its entirely fair ( especially given where we were six months ago ! ) for the laws supporters to put a glass-half-full spin on what were seeing at the moment  even if theres still a long , long way to go ."
-1	"Update : And exchange-based enrollments pass 6 million . Gaba now projects 6.5 million by 3/31 , and with the extensions it will go higher . The original CBO projection of 7 million now looks basically right , despite the website woes .Predictably , Republicans are in an uproar over the latest tweak to the Obamcare signups  an extension of the March 31 deadline for people who say that they tried to apply but encountered technical difficulty . As Jonathan Cohn says , the real objection here seems to be not so much that Obama is overstepping his bounds as that this will make it possible for more people to get insurance .But I also have the sense that people in the GOP are still working with a completely wrong narrative  namely , that Obamacare is failing , and that these are desperate ploys to save a sinking ship . The reality is quite different : enrollments have clearly surged in the final month . Charles Gaba is now projecting 6.4 million through the exchanges , and many more directly purchased from insurers .True , we dont yet know how many signups were previously uninsured , and we dont know the age/health mix of the people signing up . So we dont know how well year one of the ACA really worked , and wont for some time . The point , however , is that the system has evidently overcome most of its teething troubles .How will the GOP respond when the numbers come in ? If present behavior is any guide , theyll spend months listening to unskewers claiming that nobody is actually going to pay for policies , or that there are untold millions who lost their insurance and cant replace it , etc , etc.. There really isnt any room in their worldview for the possibility that this thing might work ."
-1	"Back when rate shock , website problems and lagging enrollment were threatening to unravel the new health care law before it fully took effect , I concluded a column on Obamacares repeated near-death experiences with the following warning to conservatives:The welfare states ability to defend itself against reform , however , carries a cautionary message for Obamacares critics as well . What isnt killed outright grows stronger the longer its embedded in the federal apparatus , gaining constituents and interest-group support just by virtue of its existence even if it doesnt work out the way it was designed . And as disastrous as its launch has been , if the health care law can survive this crisis in the same limping , staggering way it survived Scott Brown and the Supremes , then it will be a big step closer to being part of the status quo , with all the privileges and political strength that entails .So yes  its possible that this brush with death will be fatal , possible that the law will fall with the lightest , most politically painless push . But its still likely that Obamacare will be undone only if its critics are willing to do something more painful , and take their own turn wrestling with a system that resists any kind of change .With the latest numbers showing exchange enrollment climbing toward 7 million , I think we can safely retire that possible ,  and change the likely to an all-but-definite. Not because rising enrollment proves that Obamacare is definitely working , in the sense that both its friends and critics would have originally understood the term . We dont know yet what the paid enrollment looks like or how successfully the program is actually enrolling the uninsured . ( After some grim estimates , this Rand study is making liberals feel a little more optimistic , but still suggests a below-expectations result . ) We dont know what the age-and-health-status composition of the enrollee pools looks like or what that means for premiums next year and beyond . We dont know if any of the suspended/postponed provisions of the law will actually take effect . And we certainly dont know what any of this means for social policy in the long run .But we do know that there wont be an immediate political unraveling , and that we arent headed for the kind of extremely-low-enrollment scenario that seemed conceivable just a few months ago , or the possible world where cancellations had ended up outstripping enrollment , creating a net decline in the number of insured . And knowing that much has significant implications for our politics . It means that the kind of welfare-state embedding described above is taking place on a significant scale , that a large constituency will be served by Obamacare ( through Medicaid as well as the exchanges ) in 2016 and beyond , and that any kind of conservative alternative will have to confront the reality that the kind of tinkering-around-the-edges alternatives to Obamacare that many Republicans have supported to date would end up stripping coverage from millions of newly-insured Americans . That newly-insured constituency may not be as large as the bills architects originally hoped , or be composed of the range of buyers that the program ultimately needs . But it will be a fact on the ground to an extent that was by no means certain last December . And that fact will shape , and constrain , the options of the laws opponents even in the event that Republicans manage to reclaim the White House two years hence .Such political and policy constraints , I should note , are potentially a good thing for would-be conservative reformers , since the serious right-of-center alternatives to Obamacare have always included policies to expand coverage , and with a coverage expansion accomplished , Republicans may find themselves effectively forced in a more serious direction . ( This is a drum that Avik Roy , among others , has been beating for some time . ) Or so I would hope ; of course , they might just end up drifting toward gimmicky micro-reforms instead , or find themselves embroiled a ruinous civil war over how hard to push toward some kind of full repeal .But wherever they go and whatever they do , they will have to deal with the reality that Obamacare , thrice-buried , looks very much alive ."
-1	"WashingtonIF Mitt Romneys pivots on Presidents Obamas health care reform act have accelerated to a blur  from repealing on Day 1 , to preserving this or that piece , to punting the decision to the states  it is for an odd reason buried beneath two and a half years of Republican political condemnations : the architecture of the Affordable Care Act is based on conservative , not liberal , ideas about individual responsibility and the power of market forces .This fundamental ideological paradox , drowned out by partisan shouting since before the plans passage in 2010 , explains why Obamacare has only lukewarm support from many liberals , who wanted a real , not imagined , government takeover of health care. It explains why Republicans have been unable since its passage to come up with anything better . And it explains why the law is nearly identical in design to the legislation Mr. Romney passed in Massachusetts while governor .The core drivers of the health care act are market principles formulated by conservative economists , designed to correct structural flaws in our health insurance system  principles originally embraced by Republicans as a market alternative to the Clinton plan in the early 1990s . The presidents program extends the current health care system  mostly employer-based coverage , administered by commercial health insurers , with care delivered by fee-for-service doctors and hospitals  by removing the biggest obstacles to that systems functioning like a competitive marketplace .Chief among these obstacles are market limitations imposed by the problematic nature of health insurance , which requires that younger , healthier people subsidize older , sicker ones . Because such participation is often expensive and always voluntary , millions have simply opted out , a risky bet emboldened by the 24/7 presence of the heavily subsidized emergency room down the street . The health care law forcibly repatriates these gamblers , along with those who can not afford to participate in a market that ultimately cross-subsidizes their medical misfortunes anyway , when they get sick and show up in that E.R . And it outlaws discrimination against those who want to participate but can not because of their medical histories . Put aside the considerable legislative detritus of the act , and its aim is clear : to rationalize a dysfunctional health insurance marketplace .This explains why the health insurance industry has been quietly supporting the plan all along . It levels the playing field and expands the potential market by tens of millions of new customers .The rationalization and extension of the current market is financed by the other linchpin of the law : the mandate that we all carry health insurance , an idea forged not by liberal social engineers at the Brookings Institution but by conservative economists at the Heritage Foundation . The individual mandate recognizes that millions of Americans who could buy health insurance choose not to , because it requires trading away todays wants for tomorrows needs . The mandate is about personal responsibility  a hallmark of conservative thought .IN the partisan war sparked by the 2008 election , Republicans conveniently forgot that this was something many of them had supported for years . The only thing wrong with the mandate ? Mr. Obama also thought it was a good idea .The same goes for health insurance exchanges , another idea formulated by conservatives and supported by Republican governors and legislators across the country for years . An exchange is as pro-market a mechanism as they come : free up buyers and sellers , standardize the products , add pricing transparency , and watch what happens . Market Economics 101 .In the shouting match over the health care law , most have somehow missed another of its obvious virtues : it enshrines accountability  yes , another conservative idea . Under todays system , most health insurers ( and providers ) are accountable to the wrong people , often for the wrong reasons , with the needs of patients coming last . With the transparency , mobility and choice of the exchanges , businesses and individuals can decide for themselves which insurers ( and , embedded in their networks , which providers ) deserve their dollars . They can see , thanks to the often derided benefits standardization of the reform act , what they are actually buying . They can shop around . And businesses are free to decide that they are better off opting out , paying into funds that subsidize individuals coverage and letting their employees do their own shopping , with what is , in essence , their own compensation , relocated to the exchanges .Back when the idea of letting businesses and consumers pick their own plans  with their own money on an exchange  first floated around Washington , advocates called them association health plans. They , too , would have corrected for the lack of transparency , mobility and choice in local insurance markets by allowing the purchase of health insurance across state lines . They were the cornerstone of what would have been the Bush administrations reform plan ( had the administration not been distracted by other matters ) . After the rejection of Hillarycare in the mid-90s , association health plans emerged as the centerpiece of pro-market , Republican thinking about health reform  essentially what would become Romneycare , extended via federal law to cover the entire country . So much for Mr. Romneys argument that his plan in Massachusetts was an expression of states rights . His own party had bigger plans for the rest of the country , and they looked a lot like Obamacare ."
-1	"WE need death panels .Well , maybe not death panels , exactly , but unless we start allocating health care resources more prudently  rationing , by its proper name  the exploding cost of Medicare will swamp the federal budget .But in the pantheon of toxic issues  the famous third rails of American politics  none stands taller than overtly acknowledging that elderly Americans are not entitled to every conceivable medical procedure or pharmaceutical .Most notably , President Obamas estimable Affordable Care Act regrettably includes severe restrictions on any reduction in Medicare services or increase in fees to beneficiaries . In 2009 , Sarah Palins rant about death panels even forced elimination from the bill of a provision to offer end-of-life consultations .Now , three years on , the Republican vice-presidential nominee , Paul D. Ryan , has offered his latest ambitious plan for addressing the Medicare problem . But like Mr. Obamas , it holds limited promise for containing the programs escalating costs within sensible boundaries .The Obama and Ryan plans are not without common ground ; both propose an identical formula for capping the growth in Medicare spending per beneficiary . And both dip into the same toolbox ( particularly lower payments to providers ) to achieve a reduction of nearly $ 1 trillion in Medicare expenditures over the next decade from projected levels .Thats where the agreement ends . Mr. Ryan believes that meeting the goal over the long term requires introducing more competition into Medicare through vouchers to purchase private insurance .But Ryans approach was rendered toothless when the issues brutal politics forced him to retreat from his initial tough plan to simply cap the growth in government spending on Medicare and stick the inevitable overage onto beneficiaries . Under his revised plan , private insurers would be required to offer the same level of benefits as traditional Medicare , meaning that any savings would have to come from unidentified efficiencies ( the ever-popular waste , fraud and abuse ) .If the cap was breached  as it almost certainly would eventually be  Mr. Ryan blithely says , Congress would be required to intervene. Fat chance ; Congress regularly does the opposite when it rolls back caps on payments to doctors and hospitals .Meanwhile , Mr. Obamas hopes for sustained cost containment are pinned on a to-be-determined mix of squeezing reimbursements , embracing a selection of the creative ideas that have spewed forth from health care policy wonks and scouring the globe for innovations .To Mr. Obamas credit , his plan has more teeth than Mr. Ryans ; if his Independent Payment Advisory Board comes up with savings , Congress must accept either them or vote for an equivalent package . The problem is , the advisory board cant propose reducing benefits ( a k a rationing ) or raising fees ( another form of rationing ) , without which the spending target looms impossibly large .Thats the view of the bipartisan Medicare trustees , whose 2012 report stated : Actual future Medicare expenditures are likely to exceed the intermediate projections shown in this report , possibly by quite large amounts.To be sure , health care cost increases have moderated , in part because of the recession and in part because Medicare has been tightening its reimbursements . But those thumbscrews cant be tightened forever ; Medicare reimbursement rates are already well below those of private providers .Lets not forget that with the elderly population growing rapidly , even if cost increases for each beneficiary can be contained , Medicare would still claim a rising share of the American economy .Medicare needs to take a cue from Willie Sutton , who reportedly said he robbed banks because thats where the money was . The big money in Medicare is not to be found in Mr. Ryans competition or Mr. Obamas innovation , but in reducing the cost of treating people in the last year of life , which consumes more than a quarter of the programs budget .No one wants to lose an aging parent . And with price out of the equation , its natural for patients and their families to try every treatment , regardless of expense or efficacy . But that imposes an enormous societal cost that few other nations have been willing to bear . Many countries whose health care systems are regularly extolled  including Canada , Australia and New Zealand  have systems for rationing care .Take Britain , which provides universal coverage with spending at proportionately almost half of American levels . Its National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence uses a complex quality-adjusted life year system to put an explicit value ( up to about $ 48,000 per year ) on a treatments ability to extend life .At the least , the Independent Payment Advisory Board should be allowed to offer changes in services and costs . We may shrink from such stomach-wrenching choices , but they are inescapable ."

And why this latest change ? It doesnt appear to be because the law will reach fewer people . CBO now expects slightly more people to end up with health insurance , at least over the long run . The CBOs primary explanation for lower costs is that health insurance premiums on the new exchanges  what the administration calls marketplaces are lower than CBO had originally expected they would be ."
-1	"The Obama administration said yesterday that it would treat the March 31 deadline for enrolling in a health plan somewhat flexibly . Consumers who begin to apply by March 31 will have until mid-April to finish .Relatedly , according to the Kaiser Health Tracking Poll for March , substantial shares of the uninsured population dont realize that the deadline to sign up for health insurance is fast approaching .As the clock ticks down on open enrollment for new coverage options under the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) , the latest Kaiser Health Tracking Poll finds that six in ten of the uninsured are unaware of the March 31 deadline to sign up for coverage . When reminded of the deadline and the fine for not getting covered , half of those who lack coverage as of mid-March say they plan to remain uninsured . Meanwhile , four in ten of the uninsured are still unaware of the laws subsidies to help lower-income Americans purchase coverage , and half dont know about the laws expansion of Medicaid."
-1	"The current state of public opinion on health reform is really peculiar . If youve been following the issue at all closely , you know that the Affordable Care Act is one of the great comeback stories of public policy : after a terrible start , it has dramatically exceeded expectations . But hardly anyone seems to know that .Its easy to understand how that happens for Fox-watchers and Rush-listeners , who are fed a steady diet of supposed Obamacare disaster stories . Remember this ?But the real story hasnt even gotten through to many people who should know better .Over the weekend I had dinner in NYC with some very smart , sophisticated people ; yes , all of them liberals . And almost everyone in the group was under the impression that Obamacare is still going badly  they wanted me to tell them whether it could still be turned around .Meanwhile , New York ( which created its own exchange ) is a huge success story : enrollment is 60 percent higher than federal projections , premiums have been cut in half .An aside : New York was already a community-rating state , where insurers werent allowed to discriminate based on medical history . But the result of that system was that healthy people tended to stay out of the individual market , creating a bad risk pool that drove up rates . Now everyone has to be in , dramatically improving the risk pool . As such , the New York experiences demonstrates the essential role of the individual mandate for reform .But anyway , back to the mystery : here we have smart , pro-reform people living in a state where reform is going really well . And they dont know it !In part this may reflect the Obama administrations lackluster job so far in getting the word out . But it also , I think , reflects a persistent anti-ACA tilt in news coverage . In the final days of March I wrote about the de facto blackout on the obvious surge in enrollments ; if you werent reading Charles Gaba and/or bloggers who followed him , you were in the dark about a huge developing story . And this tilt has continued .Just FYI : the article I linked above , about the spectacular success of New York reform , was on page A16 "
-1	"LOS ANGELES  THE Anthem Blue Cross representative who answered my call told me that there was a silver lining in the cancellation of my individual P.P.O . policy and the $ 5,400 annual increase that I would have to pay for the Affordable Care Act-compliant option : now if I have Stage 4 cancer or need a sex-change operation , Id be covered regardless of pre-existing conditions . Never mind that the new provider network would eliminate coverage for my and my sons long-term doctors and hospitals .The Anthem rep cheerily explained that despite the companys  I paraphrase  draconian rates and limited network , my benefits , which also include maternity coverage ( handy for a 46-year-old ) , would be actually much richer.I , of course , would be actually much poorer . And it was this aspect of the bum deal that , to my surprise , turned out to be a very unpopular thing to gripe about .Obamacare or Kafkacare ?  I posted on Facebook as soon as I hung up with Anthem . I vented about the call and wrote that the president should be protecting the middle class , not making our lives substantially harder . For extra sympathy , I may have thrown in the fact that Im a single mom . ( O.K. , I did . )Then I sat back and waited for the love to pour in . Or at least the like. Lots of likes . After all , I have 1,037 Facebook friends . Surely , theyd commiserate .Except that they didnt .Instead , aside from my friend David , who attempted to cheer me up with , My dad , who never turns down a bargain , would take the sex change just because its free ,  my respondents implied  in posts that , to my annoyance , kept getting more likes  that it was beyond uncool to be whining about myself when the less fortunate would finally have insurance .The nation has been better off ,  wrote one friend . Over 33 million people who did not have insurance are now going to get it. Thats all fine and good for the nation ,  but what about my $ 5,400 rate hike ( after-tax dollars , I wanted to add , but dared not in this group of previously closeted Mother Teresas ) ? Another friend wrote , Yes , Im paying an extra 200 a month , but Im okay with doing that so that others who need it can have health care.I was shocked . Who knew my friends were such humanitarians ? Has Obamacare made it un-P.C . to be concerned by a serious burden on my familys well-being ?The heated reactions even moved offline . Frustrated , I observed to one friend who was covered through her work that when an issue didnt affect people directly , they became theoretically generous. Ask them to donate several thousand dollars so that the less fortunate can have medical insurance  which is exactly what President Obama is asking me to do  and Ill bet theyd change their tune about ending inequality and creating fairness and doing whats good for the country.Refreshingly , the two people who showed real empathy were my insurance broker and my friend Nicole , who sent daily links to news stories about people who were also stripped of their coverage and mandated to buy expensive exchange or private policies without access to their current doctors , yet just missed the cutoff for subsidies .There was one story about people suing Anthem for not being grandfathered in after changing their policies post-2010 . In fact , it was in 2011 that I altered mine , dumping maternity benefits so that I didnt have to pay for everyone elses pregnancies . Little did I know Id end up losing my insurance and paying for everyone elses pregnancies .There was even an article about a cancer patient who had lost access to her doctors . To her credit , Nicole refrained from saying , But , Lori , this woman has cancer and you are so much more fortunate ! Like Bridget Joness smug marrieds ,  the smug insureds  friends who were covered through their own or spouses employers or who were grandfathered into their plans  asked why I didnt just switch all of our long-term doctors , suck it up and pay an extra $ 200 a month for a restrictive network on the exchange , or marry the guy Im dating . How romantic : I didnt marry you just to save money , honey . I married you for your provider network.Along with the smug insureds , President Obama doesnt care much about the relatively small percentage of us with canceled coverage and no viable replacement . He keeps apologizing while maintaining that its for the good of the country , a vast improvement over all.And the over all might agree . But the self-employed middle class is being sacrificed at the altar of politically correct rhetoric , with nobody helping to ensure our health , fiscal or otherwise , because its trendy to cheer for the underdog . Embracing the noble cause is all very well  as long as yours isnt the fortunate family that loses its access to comprehensive , affordable health care while the rest of the nation gets it .The truly noble act here is being performed by my friend Nicole , who keeps posting Obamacare fiasco stories on my Facebook page , despite being conspicuously ignored , except for my single like. Its the lone like that falls in the forest , the click nobody wants to hear ."
-1	"FRANKFORT , Ky.  SUNDAY morning news programs identify Kentucky as the red state with two high-profile Republican senators who claim their rhetoric represents an electorate that gave President Obama only about a third of its presidential vote in 2012 .So why then is Kentucky  more quickly than almost any other state  moving to implement the Affordable Care Act ?Because theres a huge disconnect between the rank partisanship of national politics and the outlook of governors whose job it is to help beleaguered families , strengthen work forces , attract companies and create a balanced budget .Its no coincidence that numerous governors  not just Democrats like me but also Republicans like Jan Brewer of Arizona , John Kasich of Ohio and Rick Snyder of Michigan  see the Affordable Care Act not as a referendum on President Obama but as a tool for historic change .That is especially true in Kentucky , a state where residents collective health has long been horrendous . The state ranks among the worst , if not the worst , in almost every major health category , including smoking , cancer deaths , preventable hospitalizations , premature death , heart disease and diabetes .Were making progress , but incremental improvements are not enough . We need big solutions with the potential for transformational change .The Affordable Care Act is one of those solutions .For the first time , we will make affordable health insurance available to every single citizen in the state . Right now , 640,000 people in Kentucky are uninsured . Thats almost one in six Kentuckians .Lack of health coverage puts their health and financial security at risk .They roll the dice and pray they dont get sick . They choose between food and medicine . They ignore checkups that would catch serious conditions early . They put off doctors appointments , hoping a condition turns out to be nothing . And they live knowing that bankruptcy is just one bad diagnosis away .Furthermore , their children go long periods without checkups that focus on immunizations , preventive care and vision and hearing tests . If they have diabetes , asthma or infected gums , their conditions remain untreated and unchecked .For Kentucky as a whole , the negative impact is similar but larger  jacked-up costs , decreased worker productivity , lower quality of life , depressed school attendance and a poor image .The Affordable Care Act will address these weaknesses .Some 308,000 of Kentuckys uninsured  mostly the working poor  will be covered when we increase Medicaid eligibility guidelines to 138 percent of the federal poverty level .PricewaterhouseCoopers and the Urban Studies Institute at the University of Louisville concluded that expanding Medicaid would inject $ 15.6 billion into Kentuckys economy over the next eight years , create almost 17,000 new jobs , have an $ 802.4 million positive budget impact ( by transferring certain expenditures from the state to the federal government , among other things ) , protect hospitals from cuts in indigent care funding and shield businesses from up to $ 48 million in annual penalties .In short , we couldnt afford not to do it .The other 332,000 uninsured Kentuckians will be able to access affordable coverage  most with a discount  through the Health Benefit Exchange , the online insurance marketplace we named Kynect : Kentuckys Healthcare Connection .Kentucky is the only Southern state both expanding Medicaid and operating a state-based exchange , and we remain on target to meet the Oct. 1 deadline to open Kynect with the support of a call center that is providing some 100 jobs . Having been the first state-based exchange to complete the readiness review with the United States Department of Health and Human Services , we hope to become the first one to be certified .Frankly , we cant implement the Affordable Care Act fast enough .As for naysayers , Im offended by their partisan gamesmanship , as they continue to pour time , money and energy into overturning or defunding the Affordable Care Act . Its shameful that these critics havent invested that same level of energy into trying to improve the health of our citizens .They insist that the Affordable Care Act will never work  when in fact a similar approach put into effect in Massachusetts by Mitt Romney , then the governor , is working .So , to those more worried about political power than Kentuckys families , I say , Get over it.The Affordable Care Act was approved by Congress and sanctioned by the Supreme Court . It is the law of the land .Get over it ... and get out of the way so I can help my people . Here in Kentucky , we can not afford to waste another day or another life ."
-1	"Conservatives appear to be really upset that liberals are actually taking on the facts in the anti-Obamacare ads theyve been running . How dare you question whether the people in these ads are giving an accurate picture  theyre suffering !OK , weve seen this kind of play before . Remember how anyone suggesting that Dick Cheney and whatshisname misled us into invading Iraq was attacking Americans brave fighting men and women ?But theres a different kind of struggle anyone trying to point out the facts encounters  a barrage of anecdotes . You say that the Obamacare horror stories are fake , but I kind of know this man who is being told that he has to buy a policy he cant possibly afford / I read this sad story in the Wall Street Journal / I heard this tale on the radio / etc..How do you answer that ?Well , it cant be done retail . If the Koch brothers are pouring money into ads featuring a person , or the GOP response to the SOTU tells a story , then its worth trying to track down the particulars of this case . But to deal with the broader problem of anecdotes , what you need is a framework that tells you which anecdotes are almost surely wrong .So heres what you need to understand . The Affordable Care Act isnt magic  it produces losers as well as winners . But its not black magic either , turning everyone into a loser . What the Act does is in effect to increase the burden on fortunate people  the healthy and wealthy  to lift some burdens on the less fortunate : people with chronic illnesses or other preexisting conditions , low-income workers .Suppose , then , that someone comes to you with an anecdote about a cancer patient , or just an older person in poor health , and tells you that this person is about to lose the care she needs , or face a huge increase in expenses , under Obamacare . Well , its almost certainly not true  people like that are overwhelmingly beneficiaries of health reform , thanks to community rating , which means that they cant be discriminated against because of their condition .Or suppose that someone tells you about a struggling worker who had adequate coverage but is now being confronted with unaffordable premiums . You should immediately ask , what about the subsidies ? Because the Affordable Care Act has subsidies that are there specifically to keep premiums affordable for lower earners .If someone insists that he knows about someone in these categories who really is being grievously hurt , well , the burden of proof rests with the claimant . Basically , stories like that are going to be very rare .Obamacare opponents could , of course , go with the real losers  people in the one percent paying higher taxes , healthy young men who are getting by with cheap , minimalist policies . But they want sob stories  the sick middle-aged woman facing tragedy . And so far , every single one of those sob stories has turned out to be false  because the very nature of the reform is such that such things hardly ever happen ."
-1	"Until just the other day , Obamacare was a total disaster ; no way would it meet its first-year enrollment targets , or come anywhere close .Now the opponents have retreated to their next line of defense : OK , people are signing up , but only because their existing policies were cancelled , so the program isnt actually reducing the number of uninsured .Oops:Furthermore:These early estimates understate the full effects of the Affordable Care Act on the uninsured for two major reasons . First , the survey does not capture the enrollment surge that occurred at the end of the open enrollment period , because 80 percent of the responses to the March 2014 HRMS were provided by March 6 , 2014 . Second , these estimates do not reflect the effects of some important ACA provisions ( such as the ability to keep dependents on health plans until age 26 and early state Medicaid expansions ) that were implemented before 2013 .Remember , this is just the first year . It has been assumed all along that it would take several years for the word to spread , and the law to have its full effect ."
-1	"You might think that the methodical extermination of millions of Jews by a brutal regime intent on world domination would resist appropriation as an all-purpose metaphor . You might think that genocide , of all things , would be safe from conversion into sloppy simile .Youd be wrong .After Paul Ryans fact-challenged address at the Republican National Convention last year , the chairman of the Democratic Party in California actually compared him and his compatriots to the Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels . A short time later , the chairman of the Democratic Party in South Carolina likened that states Republican governor , Nikki Haley , to Adolf Hitlers mistress , Eva Braun .At that point Abraham Foxman , the national director of the Anti-Defamation League , did what he shouldnt need to do even once , let alone the multiple times that hes been forced to . He implored politicians and pundits to stop it already .No matter . Allusions to Nazi Germany were back for debates over gun control and , of course , Obamacare . Ted Cruz , the Senates prince of tirades , compared people who claim that the new insurance program cant be stopped to those who rolled over for Hitler and the Third Reich . This prompted a public reprimand from John McCain , who has developed something of a sideline career of swatting Cruz on the nose . Theyre like a hapless master and his hopeless dachshund . The former keeps trying to housebreak the latter , while the latter just beams at every mess he makes .Its not only Nazis who are flourishing in this era of metaphors gone mad , of analogy bloat . Lynch mobs are also having a good go of it . A senator who was quoted anonymously in The Times last week used that term to describe the Republican lawmakers who had lit into Cruz during a private luncheon , and lynching was invoked more disturbingly by the chief executive officer of A.I.G. , who recently said that public complaints about Wall Street bankers bonuses were intended to get everybody out there with their pitchforks and their hangman nooses. This , he added , was sort of like what we did in the Deep South.How absolutely bonkers . And yet how unsurprising . Were awash these days in metaphors as overworked as our political debate is overwrought , and its impossible not to wonder how much one contributes to the other . When nuance and perspective exit the language , do they exit the conversation as well ? When you speak in ludicrous extremes , do you think that way , too ?Obamacare has proved to be not just ideologically divisive but linguistically fertile . Theres seemingly no event or passage in American history to which it cant be compared .The terrorist attacks of 9/11 ? Check . Back when Mike Pence , Indianas Republican governor , was still in Congress , he summoned that days horror to characterize the Supreme Court ruling that upheld the Affordable Care Act .Slavery ? Check . Ken Cuccinelli , the Republican candidate for governor of Virginia , has described opposition to Obamacare in terms of stands against fugitive slave laws .The hyperbole and hysteria make any constructive debate impossible , and they insult the past , robbing important events of the specific meaning and individual detail they deserve . Consider our recurring -gate mania . We equate each new scandal , whether extra-large or fun-size , with Watergate , and by willfully misremembering President Richard Nixons crimes , we dilute them . Its just a suffix for the taking , a point of comparison for such wildly unrelated matters as the spilled secrets of Arkansas law enforcement officers who were supposedly privy to Bill Clintons private life . Troopergate , that was called .For President Obama , Benghazi was supposed to be his Watergate , and so was the I.R.S.s scrutiny of conservative groups , and so were a bunch of other things I cant even remember anymore . They blur and fade , which is not to say they didnt matter . Its to say that when everything is supposedly like everything else , nothings distinctive . Its all one big mush .For that reason , among others , we should watch our words . They have consequences . As irresponsible and detestable as the recent actions of the most conservative wing of House Republicans have been , wed be better off without figurative talk of hostage taking and guns to heads , without headlines like one in The Huffington Post that said : Boehner Threatens to Shoot the Hostage. That sort of language only turns up the heat .And I cringe at how pointlessly hurtful it must have been for a 9/11 widow or widower to listen to the right-wing moralist Gary Bauer exhort voters to fight back against President Obamas agenda the way passengers on United Flight 93 fought back against hijackers . Or for Holocaust survivors to hear all this gratuitous Nazi talk .You know whats just like Germany in the 1930s ? Germany in the 1930s . Were in an unfortunate place , but we neednt travel back there to describe it ."
-1	"Like confused poll respondents , Scott Brown , the former Massachusetts Senator whos running for Senate in New Hampshire , says he thinks the Affordable Care Act is disastrous , but seems to like everything it does .Via VoxIn an interview with WBUR , he called Obamacare a disaster. Then he was asked what hes for  and he went on to describe Obamacare . Ive always felt that people should either get some type of health care options , or pay for it with a nice competitive fee ,  he said . Thats all great . I believe it in my heart . In terms of preexisting conditions , catastrophic coverages , covering kids , whatever we want to do. He even said it could include the Medicaid expansion [ for ] folks who need that care and coverage.Oh , he also promises his plan wont raise taxes , cut spending on Medicare , or make people drive very far to go to the hospital . So his plan will have more generous insurance options and no way to pay for them . In other words , his plan will be like Obamacare , but even better ! Call it Fauxbamacare ."
-1	"Ezra Klein , in his new capacity as one of the impresarios behind Vox , has written a pair of attention-grabbing posts  here , and then here  defending the proposition that Obamacare has , in some sense , won ,  and that conservatives who cant come to terms with that victory cant come to terms with reality itself . Reading them , it struck me that this argument would benefit from laying down some specific markers for the near future , because Klein seems to move back and forth between two definitions of success . At times , as when he writes that Obamacare has won its survival and allows that that there are still many good critiques to make of the law , he seems to be using a narrow definition , with which I mostly agree  the law wont collapse under its own weight , the enrollment levels are high enough to make a return to the coverage status quo ante unlikely , etc . But when he uses language like the individual mandate  is working and the law is back on its expected track ,  and concludes that  [ Kathleen Sebelius ] can leave with the law she helped build looking , shockingly , like a success ,  it implies a stronger definition of victory , in which Obamacare isnt just continuing , isnt just unlikely to be swiftly repealed , but is clearly succeeding as a policy in basically the way its advocates predicted that it would .So I think it would be useful for the laws supporters to specify the metrics/numbers/outcomes that would vindicate the latter claim . Here are three fronts where specificity would be helpful:Enrollment . In the summer of 2012 , after the Supreme Court decision freeing up states to reject the Medicaid expansion , the C.B.O . projected that 14 million Americans would get coverage under Obamacare in the first year , and 33 million by 2022 . This February , after the botched rollout , the projections were 13 million in 2014 , 27 million in the long run . The latest estimate , out this month , drops the 2014 projection down to 12 million , and the long-term number to 26 million . Meanwhile , the question of how many previously-uninsured people have gained insurance as of right now is , as this Vox explainer suggests , quite difficult to answer ( and sadly , it may be about to become even more difficult ) , but a guesstimate of 9-10 million seems pretty plausible  and short , N.B. , of even the C.B.O.s more modest projection for this year .So  how low can the numbers go before they start to make the law look like something less than a success ? I assume that liberals will declare victory , with some reason , if Obamacare meets the C.B.O.s current ( reduced ) expectations , this year and beyond . But what if it doesnt ? Suppose that by the end of 2016 , when the C.B.O . expects the total number of uninsured to have fallen by 25 million , its only fallen by , say , 15 million instead  and most of the previously uninsured are getting coverage through Medicare , while the exchanges are mostly populated by people whose prior individual-market coverage was cancelled , either in 2014 or once grandfathering runs out . Will that be a success story ? Presumably theres some kind of shortfall that the laws supporters would consider , if not a sign of outright failure , than at least a reason to be fairly disappointed with how Obamacare has worked . It would be helpful to know what they think that long-run number lies .The cost curve . Before we entered into the agony of the botched roll-out , the laws supporters were eagerly citing the persistently low rate of health care inflation as a sign that Obamacare was already working as designed , already having a beneficial effect . But as Voxs Sarah Kliff reported yesterday , the latest inflation numbers cast some doubt on that hopeful hypothesis , with federal data indicating that health care spending is now growing just as quickly as it was prior to the recession.Now this may be temporary : Some kind of cost inflation was always likely to be associated with this years roll-out of subsidies and Medicaid spending , and the laws supporters can reasonably argue that we should wait a few years , until the coverage expansion ( however large ) has become a normal feature of the system , to judge Obamacares impact on inflation overall .But at a certain point that judgment will need to be made . So , again , what should be the standard ? What should be the baseline ? Does Obamacare need to hold inflation to the low 2011-2012 pace ( a pace , again , that many liberals wanted to credit to its early impact ) in order to be counted as a cost-containing success ? Does it just need to hold inflation below , say , a 10 or 20-year average ? ( Note that both on its own terms and relative to overall inflation , health cost inflation had been declining for seven years before Obamacare was passed  so just holding either rate below the average of 2000-2010 would not actually be that impressive . ) In other words  what does the Affordable Care Act have to achieve in order to live up to its name ?Health outcomes . Its been crowded out by the website drama like everything else , but one of the major divides between Obamacare supporters and skeptics was over whether , and to what extent , the law would literally be a lifesaver  with writers like Klein famously invoking lives saved figures in the hundreds of thousands during the run-up to the laws passage , while doubters cited the surprisingly-weak link between insurance status and health outcomes , and raised the potential public-health downsides , in terms of innovations lost or never sought , of increasing government control .Now public health data can be even fuzzier and more debatable than cost inflation and enrollment numbers . But even with lower-than-hoped-for enrollment figures overall , we should still be able to see some of the happy consequences , at some point , if Klein et . al . are right : Looking back from 2020 or 2025 , certainly , there should be some kind of disjuncture between U.S. health outcomes pre- and post-Obamacare ( maybe a reversal of this trend , at the very least ? ) , and some kind of outcomes gap should open between states that implemented the law fully and states that refused the extra Medicaid dollars .So here , too , Im curious what liberals expect to see , what theyll count as vindication , what would disappoint them , and what kind of results they think will be sufficient to prove that Obamacare is , in fact , a lifesaving success .And then for my own part , Ill lay down this marker for the future : If , in 2023 , the uninsured rate is where the C.B.O . currently projects or lower , health inflations five-year average is running below the post-World War II norm , and the trend in the age-adjusted mortality rate shows a positive alteration starting right about now , I will write a post ( or send out a Singularity-wide transmission , maybe ) entitled I Was Wrong About Obamacare  or , if he prefers , just Ezra Klein Was Right."
-1	"TODAY marks the beginning of health care coverage under the Affordable Care Acts new insurance exchanges , for which two million Americans have signed up . Now that the individual mandate is officially here , let me begin with an admission : Obamacare is awful .That is the dirty little secret many liberals have avoided saying out loud for fear of aiding the presidents enemies , at a time when the ideal of universal health care needed all the support it could get . Unfortunately , this meant that instead of blaming companies like Novartis , which charges leukemia patients $ 90,000 annually for the drug Gleevec , or health insurance chief executives like Stephen Hemsley of UnitedHealth Group , who made nearly $ 102 million in 2009 , for the sky-high price of American health care , the presidents Democratic supporters bought into the myth that it was all those people going to get free colonoscopies and chemotherapy for the fun of it .I believe Obamacares rocky start  clueless planning , a lousy website , insurance companies raising rates , and the presidents telling people they could keep their coverage when , in fact , not all could  is a result of one fatal flaw : The Affordable Care Act is a pro-insurance-industry plan implemented by a president who knew in his heart that a single-payer , Medicare-for-all model was the true way to go . When right-wing critics expose the fact that President Obama endorsed a single-payer system before 2004 , theyre actually telling the truth .What we now call Obamacare was conceived at the Heritage Foundation , a conservative think tank , and birthed in Massachusetts by Mitt Romney , then the governor . The president took Romneycare , a program designed to keep the private insurance industry intact , and just improved some of its provisions . In effect , the president was simply trying to put lipstick on the dog in the carrier on top of Mitt Romneys car . And we knew it .By 2017 , we will be funneling over $ 100 billion annually to private insurance companies . You can be sure theyll use some of that to try to privatize Medicare .For many people , the affordable part of the Affordable Care Act risks being a cruel joke . The cheapest plan available to a 60-year-old couple making $ 65,000 a year in Hartford , Conn. , will cost $ 11,800 in annual premiums . And their deductible will be $ 12,600 . If both become seriously ill , they might have to pay almost $ 25,000 in a single year . ( Pre-Obamacare , they could have bought insurance that was cheaper but much worse , potentially with unlimited out-of-pocket costs . )And yet  I would be remiss if I didnt say this  Obamacare is a godsend . My friend Donna Smith , who was forced to move into her daughters spare room at age 52 because health problems bankrupted her and her husband , Larry , now has cancer again . As she undergoes treatment , at least she wont be in terror of losing coverage and becoming uninsurable . Under Obamacare , her premium has been cut in half , to $ 456 per month .Lets not take a victory lap yet , but build on what there is to get what we deserve : universal quality health care .Those who live in red states need the benefit of Medicaid expansion . It may have seemed like smart politics in the short term for Republican governors to grab the opportunity offered by the Supreme Court rulings that made Medicaid expansion optional for states , but it was long-term stupid : If those 20 states hold out , they will eventually lose an estimated total of $ 20 billion in federal funds per year  money that would be going to hospitals and treatment .In blue states , lets lobby for a public option on the insurance exchange  a health plan run by the state government , rather than a private insurer . In Massachusetts , State Senator James B. Eldridge is trying to pass a law that would set one up . Some counties in California are also trying it . Montana came up with another creative solution . Gov . Brian Schweitzer , a Democrat who just completed two terms , set up several health clinics to treat state workers , with no co-pays and no deductibles . The doctors there are salaried employees of the state of Montana ; their only goal is their patients health . ( If this sounds too much like big government to you , you might like to know that Google , Cisco and Pepsi do exactly the same . )All eyes are on Vermonts plan for a single-payer system , starting in 2017 . If it flies , it will change everything , with many states sure to follow suit by setting up their own versions . Thats why corporate money will soon flood into Vermont to crush it . The legislators wholl go to the mat for this will need all the support they can get : If you live east of the Mississippi , look up the bus schedule to Montpelier .So lets get started . Obamacare cant be fixed by its namesake . Its up to us to make it happen ."
-1	"A panel of the D.C. federal appellate court ruled today that the federal government does not have the authority to administer insurance subsidies in states that refused to set up their own exchanges . If the ruling standsa big ifit could deprive millions of enrollees of the support they need to purchase health insurance .Via The Incidental EconomistHow much will this decision cost the working poor ? The amount varies with income and other variables , but for a 40 year old individual making $ 30,000 a year , the tax credit was estimated at $ 1345 ( KFF estimate here ) . Retroactive tax bills under Halbig will be significant and everyone impacted will have trouble paying for health insurance going forward ( about 57 % of exchange participants were previously uninsured , according to a KFF survey ) . How many people will be hurt ?At first glance : anyone receiving tax credits in the 27 states with federally facilitated exchanges ( FFEs ) : ( AL , AK , AZ , FL , GA , IN , KS , LA , ME , MS , MO , MT , NE , NJ , NC , ND , OH , OK , PN , SC , SD , TN , TX , UT , VA , WI and WY ; KFF list here ) . But the government reports 36 states as having FFEs , including 9 additional states not included on the list above ( ID , NM , AR , DE , IL , IA , MI , NH , and WV ; more on this below ) . Using this broader definition , 4.683 million Americans may now have a surprising tax bill and be at risk of losing health insurance , being told retroactively that they didnt qualify for tax credits after all ."
-1	"The Times has a very nice survey of the results to date of the Affordable Care Act , aka Obamacare , aka death panels and the moral equivalent of slavery .The verdict : Its going well . A big expansion in coverage , which is affordable for a large majority ; the main exceptions seem to be people who went for the minimum coverage allowed , keeping premiums down but leaving large co-payments . None of the predictions of disaster has come even slightly true ."
-1	"Yesterday , Ohio governor John Kasich briefly made news when the Associated Press quoted him saying that repeal of Obamacare was simply not gon na happen ,  and adding that the opposition to it was really either political or ideological ,  and in either case insufficiently attuned to the real improvements in peoples lives. Liberals pounced , conservatives groaned , and Kasich quickly went into damage control mode , explaining that he was only talking about the Medicaid expansion , which he had already explicitly supported and implemented , and not the rest of the law , which he still officially wants to ( say it with me ) repealandreplace .That last is the official position , of course , of the entire Republican Party , which currently enjoys , per my colleagues at The Upshot , a 66 percent chance of seizing a Senate majority in two weeks time . But the controversy around Kasichs comments are a useful reminder that not only is there no Republican consensus on how to actually replace the health care law , but almost no G.O.P . Senate candidates are actually campaigning on a politically credible replacement plan  with politically credible defined , for reasons Ive elaborated on before , as not rolling coverage levels back toward the pre-Obamacare status quo.The one major exception is Ed Gillespie , running against Mark Warner in Virginia , whose plan Ramesh Ponnuru has commented on and defended here and here . ( Since Gillespies background is in what Ive called the donorist wing of the party , which does not always distinguish itself in pushing middle-class-friendly economic policy , he deserves particular credit for taking the policy leap . ) But Gillespie is also , per current polling , unlikely to join a Republican Senate majority next year , whereas many G.O.P . candidates  the potential Majority Leader included  who have hemmed and hawed or talked in anti-Obamacare boilerplate and vague generalities when asked about health care policy are more likely to pull their races out . Which will be seen by some , no doubt , as vindicating the risk-averse , somewhat cynical approach to health policy that Republicans have taken throughout the health care debate  except , of course , that in this cycle that debate is happening against the backdrop of a political map that heavily favors the G.O.P. , whereas in 2016 ( as in 2012 ) the map will be different , tougher , and the health care law ( while no doubt still unpopular overall ) will be more locked-in , more a part of peoples ordinary experience , and the promise of full repeal will look even sketchier than it does now . At which point a Republican Party that wants to be competitive nationally will start to feel a lot of pressure ( probably not quite enough to counteract the influence of the primary electorate , but well see ) to drift toward something like Kasichs ( quite popular , in a purple state ) position , which basically amounts to if you like the single-payer part of Obamacare , you can keep the single-payer part of Obamacare , and lets talk about the other stuff later.For conservatives who dont want their party to gradually , eventually , inevitably end up taking roughly that position in national elections , then , theres a pretty narrow window to rally around something like the Gillespie approach instead . That window was open in this campaign ; I think it will be open again in 2016 . After that , though , the political risks ( already real enough ) associated with backing a legitimate Obamacare alternative will rise apace , the downsides of calling for outright repeal will likewise increase , and Republicans running for office outside red states will probably just end up endorsing the views that Ohios popular governor is dancing around right now .Of course events might intervene , but for now anti-Obamacare but reform-minded conservatives should be rooting for Gillespie to pull off a miracle comeback  because a party that can not imitate his Obamacre position today will almost certainly accept John Kasichs position tomorrow ."
-1	"A peculiar aspect of the Obama years has been the disconnect between the rage of Obamas enemies and the yawns of his sort-of allies . The right denounces financial reform as a vast government takeover  and lobbies fiercely against it  while the left dismisses reform as symbols without substance . The right accuses Obama of being a socialist stealing the money of hard-working billionaires , while the left dismisses him as having done nothing to address inequality .On all these issues , the truth is that Obama has done far more than he gets credit for  not everything youd want , to be sure , or even most of what should be done , but enough so that the right has reason to be furious .The latest case in point : taxes on the one percent . I keep hearing that Obama has done nothing to make the one percent pay more ; the Congressional Budget Office does not agree:According to CBO , the effective tax rate on the one percent  reflecting the end of the Bush tax cuts at the top end , plus additional taxes associated with Obamacare  is now back to pre-Reagan levels . You could argue that we should have raised taxes at the top much more , to lean against the widening of market inequality , and I would agree . But its still a much bigger change than I think anyone on the left seems to realize ."
-1	"Or , actually , demonstrates by example whats wrong with Washington .Matt Yglesias finds Ron Fournier saying this about health reform:On health care , we needed a market-driven plan that decreases the percentage of uninsured Americans without convoluting the U.S. health care system . Just such a plan sprang out of conservative think tanks and was tested by a GOP governor in Massachusetts , Mitt Romney .Instead of a bipartisan agreement to bring that plan to scale , we got more partisan warfare . The GOP resisted , Obama surrendered his mantle of bipartisanship , and Democrats muscled through a one-sided law that has never been popular with a majority of the public .The mind reels . How is it possible for anyone who has been following politics and , presumably , policy for the past six years not to know that Obamacare is , in all important respects , identical to Romneycare ? It has the same three key provisions  nondiscrimination by insurers , a mandate for individuals , and subsidies to make the mandate workable . It was developed by the same people . I and many others have frequently referred to ObamaRomneycare .Well , Ive know for years that many political pundits dont think that understanding policy is part of their job . But this is still extreme . And Im sorry to go after an individual here  but for Gods sake , dont you have to know something about the actual content of a policy you critique ?And whats actually going on here is worse than ignorance . Its pretty clear that were watching a rule of thumb according to which if Republicans are against a proposal , that means it must be leftist and extreme , and the burden on the White House is to find a way to make the GOP happy . Needless to say , this rewards obstructionism  there is literally nothing Obama can do to convince some ( many ) pundits that hes making a good faith effort , because they dont pay any attention to what he does , only to the Republican reaction .Awesome ."
-1	"Very busy , so no substantive posting today . But I did want to share a thought from the past few days . I posted about the surprisingly good news , at least so far , on Obamacare premiums for 2015  and as usual was met with a wall of rage from the right . The idea that this thing might be working inspires a level of anger nothing else ( except maybe climate science ) matches .No news there . Nor is it news that such people know things that aint so . But theres something Ive noticed from the combination of reactions to what I write and researching past coverage of Obamacare . It goes like this : a lot of the untrue beliefs people have about Obamacare come not so much from outright false reporting as from selective reporting . Every suggestion of bad news gets highlighted  especially , of course , but not only by Fox , the WSJ , etc.. But when it turns out that the news wasnt really that bad , these sources just move on . There are claims that millions of people are losing coverage  headlines ! When it turns out not to be true  crickets ! Some experts claim that premiums will rise by double digits  big news ! Actual premium numbers come in and theyre surprisingly low  not mentioned .The result is that most news consumers  who form impressions rather than trying to work out details  have the sense that its been all bad news . This is true even for people who dont rely on Fox  I get asked about the scary premium hikes by people on the Upper West Side ! And of course for those who do get their news from Fox , well , they know , just know , that Obamacare has reduced the number of Americans with insurance and caused premiums to double or something , even though even their favorite news source isnt saying such things .We need a term for beliefs based on reports that have been superseded ; maybe fossils instead of zombies . Anyway , its striking ."
-1	"One thing about the Obamacare denialists : they dont give up . First nobody but the sick would sign up , so wed have a death spiral . Then it was OK , a lot of people have signed up , but they wont pay  and anyway , even more people have lost coverage. Now they face evidence like this:And the response Im seeing is Its not Obamacare , its the improving economy .But it isnt . The decline is too sharp , too closely associated with the enrollment period to be driven by the at best gradual improvement in the job market . But wait , theres more . The Urban Institute breaks down the decline in uninsurance by Medicaid adoption or not , which is closely correlated with the general question of whether states are helping implementation or blocking it . Heres how it looks:Sorry , an improving economy cant explain why the decline in uninsured is three times as large in pro-Obamacare states as it is in anti-reform states .Its the policy , stupid ."
-1	"President Obama wrote on Monday that the Federal Communications Commission should issue strong regulations to prevent cable and phone companies from dividing the Internet into fast and slow lanes .Writing in more detail than he has offered previously on the subject , Mr. Obama said the commission , which is independent of the administration , should undo a long-standing regulatory mistake by re-classifying broadband Internet service as a telecommunications service , not a lightly-regulated information service . That would allow the commission to ban cable and phone companies from blocking , slowing down or otherwise interfering with the videos , music and other content that their customers access on the Internet . As we wrote in an editorial on Sunday , under current rules companies like Verizon and Time Warner Cable have the right to favor some content over others . For example , they could decide to deliver content from a provider that pays them a fee faster than information from competing services . Such arrangements would limit consumer choice and the ability of start-ups to compete on the Web .We can not allow Internet service providers ( ISPs ) to restrict the best access or to pick winners and losers in the online marketplace for services and ideas ,  Mr. Obama wrote .Not surprisingly , cable and phone companies and some of their supporters in Congress are not happy with Mr. Obamas proposal . Comcast issued a statement calling it a radical reversal that would harm investment and innovation , as todays immediate stock market reaction demonstrates. ( Shares of Comcast were down 3.8 percent at noon , but shares in Verizon and AT & T were up slightly . ) Senator Ted Cruz tried , confusingly and desperately , to link Mr. Obamas proposal to health reform , a favorite whipping boy of Republicans that is actually working quite well:Net Neutrality is Obamacare for the Internet ; the Internet should not operate at the speed of government . Senator Ted Cruz ( @ SenTedCruz ) 10 Nov 14The industrys concerns are unfounded and self-interested . And the reaction of lawmakers like Mr. Cruz is partisan hyperbole . Mr. Obama made clear that he does not want the F.C.C . to regulate broadband as it regulates traditional telephone service even if it reclassifies it as a telecommunications service . For example , there is no reason for the commission to regulate the price of Internet service , as regulators do for traditional home phone lines .But other telecommunications rules should apply . For example , federal telephone regulations make sure that you can use your AT & T phone to call people using T-Mobile by requiring the companies to connect their networks to each other . The same should be true on the Internet  you should be able to use Netflix just as easily as you would be able to use Amazons streaming service .This is at the heart of what Mr. Obama is proposing:For almost a century , our law has recognized that companies who connect you to the world have special obligations not to exploit the monopoly they enjoy over access in and out of your home or business . That is why a phone call from a customer of one phone company can reliably reach a customer of a different one , and why you will not be penalized solely for calling someone who is using another provider . It is common sense that the same philosophy should guide any service that is based on the transmission of information  whether a phone call , or a packet of data .Mr. Obamas reasoning might not satisfy phone and cable companies or their friends in Congress , who have a visceral allergic reaction to regulations . But that should not stop the F.C.C . from adopting his well-argued proposal ."
-1	"The politics of Obamacare are clearly starting to shift . Its not that the public is coming to love it  not yet , anyway . But its less and less of a bogeyman , with polls suggesting a majority of the public against flat-out repeal . So theres increasing pressure on Republicans to lay out an alternative  and continuing surprise about their inability to articulate one .But this is an example of why it sometimes helps , even in straight political reporting , to understand how policy works . Heres the essential fact about health care policy , which in turn fundamentally shapes health care politics:Obamacare looks the way it does because it has to .Once again , for those who missed it : if you want to cover people with preexisting conditions , you must have community rating . If you want to have community rating without a death spiral  that is , if you want to keep an acceptable risk pool  you have to have an individual mandate . If you want to have an individual mandate , you have to have subsidies for lower-income Americans . And thats Obamacare : a three-legged stool , with all three legs essential .Republicans cant offer an alternative because there isnt one ( aside , that is , from single-payer ) . Their plan , such as it was , was to wait for the plan to implode , so they would never be put on the spot ; since that isnt happening , Plan B is to bob and weave and avoid the question until the midterms . Thats all there is ."
-1	"David Brooks : Well , that was pretty much a complete drubbing .Gail Collins : Dont rub it in , David .David : I guess the Republicans will pick up between eight and 10 Senate seats once the dust settles in Alaska , Virginia and Louisiana . The victories at the gubernatorial level are even more impressive . Scott Walkers win in Wisconsin was pretty significant . The biggest surprise to me was Larry Hogan getting himself elected governor of thoroughly blue Maryland . Plus Bruce Rauners win as governor of Illinois was unexpected and huge . This was a national verdict .Gail : Yeah , things were even worse than I expected . The most depressing result , for me , was Sam Brownback being re-elected governor in Kansas . If you can wreck the states economy and not get punished at all  I dont know what there is to say .David : It seems to me the Republican challenge is to understand what the party has done right without getting carried away by triumphalism . The Democratic challenge is to understand where the party went wrong without giving way to despair . Maybe we can talk about strengths and weaknesses ?Gail : Well , I guess thats better than staying here under the bed , curled in a fetal position . You first .David : I guess the beginning of Republican wisdom is to understand that this was more a case of the Democrats losing this particular election than it was a case of the Republicans winning it . The Democrats have talked a lot about wage stagnation and income inequality but they have offered nothing compelling to address these problems . President Obama lost the House four years ago because he seemed too liberal for the country after the passage of Obamacare . He lost the Senate this year because he seemed too passive , not competent , not in control . The rollout of Obamacare was the crucial moment of his second term .Gail : I agree that the president has often seemed passive . And theres been a lot of misspeaking for somebody whos supposed to be a great communicator . But I dont buy the idea that the Democrats failed to address wage stagnation and income inequality . Raise the minimum wage , create good jobs improve the nations roads and bridges , expand quality pre-K programs to give the next generation a boost  thats pretty much all they talked about .David : The big Republican accomplishment is that they have detoxified their brand . Four years ago they seemed scary and extreme to a lot of people . They no longer seem that way . The wins in purple states like North Carolina , Iowa and Colorado are clear indications that the party can at least gain a hearing among swing voters . And if the G.O.P . presents a reasonable candidate ( and this years crop was very good ) , then Republicans can win anywhere . I think weve left the Sarah Palin phase and entered the Tom Cotton phase .Gail : I wouldnt call this years crop very good , except in the sense that theyre definitely a less extreme group than we saw in the last few seasons . Although some  like Joni Ernst , who won the Senate seat in Iowa  are still downright scary .But the Republicans have gotten very good at teaching their candidates how to tamp down political screechiness .David : I was especially struck by Ed Gillespies amazing showing in Virginia . He ran one of the more policy-oriented campaigns in the country . At a time when consultants around the nation insulted voters intelligence with dumb campaigns , he honored their intelligence by talking about policy and was rewarded for it , win or lose . Maybe it takes a guy who has been a professional consultant to not listen to the consultants .Gail : Virginia shocked me . And Kay Hagans loss in North Carolina saddened me . The new Democratic South seems to exist mainly in theory .David : Scott Walkers victory in Wisconsin is also significant . The public is clearly unhappy with public sector unions , even in a traditionally progressive place like Wisconsin . Faced with a budget crisis , a mayor or governor can take on those unions and survive and even thrive . Hell become a compelling national figure in 2016 .Gail : Yeah , when the only unions left standing are the ones composed of people who work for the taxpayers , the labor movement is in a pretty sad shape . The Republicans have done a very good job of making it almost impossible to organize in the private sector .David : I wouldnt give up on private sector unions . I suspect some institution will grow up to give workers more bargaining power against employers , even if it doesnt look like the 20th-century model .Republicans should be wary of over-interpreting their mandate . Scott Brown ran hard against immigration reform and he was a rare Republican loser last night .Gail : That seemed like a weird choice of themes for New Hampshire , but maybe Brown just forgot which state he was campaigning in . I will refrain from making any jokes about how his next move will be to buy a camper and head for California , where Barbara Boxer is up for re-election in 2016 . There will always be a woman running for the Senate somewhere who he can challenge .David : I would love to see a Brown-Boxer race . Sort of a setup for a U.P.S . advertising campaign . The deeper problem for Republicans is their party still has no growth agenda . Figuring out a set of policies commensurate with the size of the structural economic issues is the next big task .Gail : See , thats the frustrating thing . For the last two years the Senate has had Democratic committee chairs who went out of their way to work with Republicans on economic issues . But they were stonewalled by the Republican leadership . And then the voters blamed the Democratic incumbents for gridlock .David : For Democrats , I guess one big lesson is : Stop talking to each other . Democratic politicians spent the early part of the year running against the Koch brothers . That argument may scare a lot of people in liberal bastions , but no one outside of these bastions knows about them or cares .Gail : Its totally true that politicians and the media care much more about campaign contributors than voters do I always secretly thought that if God wanted Americans to care about campaign finance reform he would have made it easier to explain . Although there was that one brief , shining moment in 2000  John McCain . Presidential primary . New Hampshire . Amazing to think back on how that one guy in a bus just went from town meeting to town meeting talking about how to get money out of politics .Gone but not quite forgotten .David : Then the Democrats came back with the 2012 playbook  all the talk about contraception and womens issues . That was tone deaf , given where the country is .Gail : I dont agree at all . Of course you cant give the impression that reproductive rights is the only thing youre running on . But the real problem for the Democrats was that the Republicans figured out how to defuse the issue.Ask me about abortion and Ill tell you that birth control pills should be sold over the counter .The Democrats arent going to have the luxury of running against the kind of Cro-Magnon candidates the Republicans were putting up a few years ago . Although I was tickled to see that the congressman in Florida who held the men-only gathering went down the drain . You know , the one who felt guys needed to be by themselves so they could feel free to drink , smoke and discuss serious topics .David : Democrats also need to ask themselves what it will take for them to be a congressional party once again . That means winning in places likes Arkansas , once solid Democratic states . Over the near term it means shelving theories about an emerging Democratic majority  hoping that a tide of Democratic voters will sweep the Democrats into permanent power . That still may happen over the long term , but Democrats are just terrible at appealing to white voters , especially less-educated white voters .Gail : No matter what the demographics of the future are going to look like , you obviously want candidates who can appeal to poor white and poor minority candidates at the same time . But its not easy to do . I dont think the Republicans are meeting uneducated white voters needs . Theyre just appealing to their fear of change .David : The core problem for Democrats , it seems to me , is that voters are just too skeptical of government  at least as it currently exists . Obamacare may not have been a huge issue , but Republicans ran lots of ads about it , and it remains deeply unpopular . Democrats somehow need to figure out how to offer government programs when people are innately suspicious of government as something alien and ineffective .Gail : The Republicans have done a terrific job of making their base hate government , even when they benefit greatly from government programs . And its ironic that President Obama , who ran as a great communicator , has been so awful at countering that message .David : The final point is that this election marks the end of the Obama presidencys power on the domestic front . In 2008 , I would not have expected it to come to this . The verdict is still out on what Obamas legacy will be , but its certainly true that he did not succeed where F.D.R. , Reagan and even Clinton did  in building a plausible majority for his party .Gail : I know that the rule of our pundit profession is that now we must turn our attention completely away from the current administration and do nothing but speculate about the presidential race in 2016 . But I want to give Obama a little more time before I declare him a goner . If he leaves behind a national health care program and a significant start to the battle against climate change , hell have actually accomplished much more as president than Clinton did . But I guess the nation wont learn to appreciate him unless hes impeached ."
-1	"For reference : I count at least six distinct predictions of Obamacare doom made by the usual suspects , not one of which has come true . Here they are:1 . Enrollment will be very low , and2 . Even if people sign up , they wont pay their premiums .Reality : Signups exceeded expectations , and the vast majority paid .3 . More people will lose coverage cancelled by Obamacare than gain it .Reality : Sharp drop in the number of uninsured .4 . Rate shock .Reality : Like it says , affordable care .5 . Young people not signing up , and death spiral .Reality : Pretty good demographics .6 . Soaring health costs .Reality : Health costs are below anyones expectations .Its quite an impressive track record , actually . And whats even more impressive is that none of the usual suspects will even consider admitting having been wrong ."

Charles Gaba:Theres the usual yammering about But how many have PAID ? ? ?  , But how many were ALREADY INSURED ? ? ?  , How many were YOUNG ? ? ?  and What METAL LEVEL did they get ? ? ?  etc etc etc . All of these are reasonable questions for actuarials , accountants and so forth to ask , and the answers will indeed help shape our understanding of what the overall economic and health status of the population at large will be .For the moment , however , none of that matters . This is an outstanding number any way you slice it .Meanwhile , via Wonkbook , a guide to unskewing the numbers . Yep , I blame zombie ACORN ."
-1	"You still encounter people claiming that Obamacare has been a disaster , that more people have lost insurance than gained it , etc. , etc . But the reality is that it has already made a big dent in the number of uninsured ; and the quality of insurance has gone up , too , because canceled policies were canceled because they offered little real protection .Of course , the coming of the law in January 2014 has been a big job-killer .. or maybe not:This is what success looks like ."
-1	"My Sunday column considered various possible and partial explanations for President Obamas long year of low approval ratings , which seem likely to help cost his party control of the Senate tomorrow . The big four I considered were structural forces ( the idea that polarization and gridlock alone suffice to send most second-term presidents regressing to the low 40s ) , the essential mediocrity of our recovered economy , the continued unpopularity of Obamacare , and foreign policy ( where the presidents approval ratings have fallen hard ) as a kind of synecdoche for larger doubts about the administrations basic competence . Obviously there are many more factors one could consider , but since I write about the issue frequently I thought I should explain why I didnt include immigration , another area where the presidents approval numbers have plummeted as his administration has stumbled in various ways over the last year .My reasoning , basically , was similar to the reasoning I use when analyzing the commonplace claim that immigration is about to doom Republicans forever : I just dont see a lot of evidence that the issue usually moves that many votes , white or Hispanic or otherwise , no matter which way it happens to be cutting at the moment . Its true that recent events ( the child migrant surge , the White Houses strange handling of its promised amnesty , the climate of Ebola-related anxiety ) have made the politics of immigration for favorable to conservatives than they were a couple of years ago , and the failure to pass immigration reform probably contributes something to Hispanic disappointment with the president . But I still feel that immigration is ultimately more a kind of subplot within the broader categories my column proposed  one reason among many to be anxious about presidential competence , or one reason among many to blame Obama for gridlock  than an issue that deserves pride of place in analyzing the presidents weakened position .Some evidence : If you look at some recent polls on voter priorities , immigration is ( of course ) swamped by the economy , but it also tends to be cited only about half as often the national security/international affairs/terrorism nest of issues , which I think has played a much larger role in undercutting the publics approval of the president . Likewise , if you look at this feature that maps midterm-election conversations on social media , youll see immigration getting significant play mostly in districts in the south and west that are already overwhelmingly represented by Republicans ,  rather than dominating the conversation in swing states . Again , that doesnt mean its an inconsequential issue , but it does make me doubt its distinctive power over the presidents ( un ) popularity and his partys midterm fate .I could be wrong , of course . If I were inclined to play Mickey Kaus for a day and elevate immigrations significance a little higher , it would be on the grounds that the immigration debate is an important case study in just how easily cracks can can open up within the presidents 2008/2012 majority , and how the Democratic Partys diversity-as-strength approach to coalition-building can turn into ex uno plures in a hurry . That is , up until recently , immigration was a policy area where the president was able to successfully promise a great deal to his base without paying any kind of major price among swing voters  because what he was promising to activists ( the DREAM Act ) was pretty popular and didnt conflict with his parallel strategy of touting deportation numbers and an allegedly-secured border , because theres broad support for some kind of immigration compromise and most voters arent exactly detail-oriented , and because the G.O.P.s consultants were terrified of contesting the issue . But once the border started to look less secure ( in part , perhaps , because of DREAM-created incentives ) and activists started demanding something much bigger ( the sweeping executive amnesty that the White House seemed poised to offer , than walked back ) , Obamas two-step turned into something that cost him with the base and the middle  effectively undoing one of his most successful first term strategies , emboldening Republicans to criticize his policies rather than just promising compromise or ducking , and opening space between the so-called coalition of the ascendant and the older , whiter voters the Democrats still need to win in , say , Iowa .I think this analysis has some merit ( not surprisingly , since I just spun it ) ; I just dont think it proves immigrations major salience in knocking down the presidents approval ratings and/or influencing this cycle . But well get an interesting test in New Hampshire , where Scott Brown has campaigned heavily on the issue ; if he pulls out an upset , my estimation of immigrations impact on Obamas swoon and 2014s outcomes will go up . And whether it explains a lot or just a little of Obamas struggles , the way the issue has played out over the last 18 months does potentially foreshadow similar/broader difficulties for the Democratic coalition as it moves into the post-Obama era , in ways that Im sure Ill have reason to discuss again ."
-1	"LEXINGTON , Ky.  Political campaigns arent generally associated with specificity or truth-telling and political debates are no different . But at Monday nights debate in Lexington , both Senator Mitch McConnell and his Democratic challenger , Alison Lundergan Grimes , the Kentucky Secretary of State , reached absurd heights in the art of weasel-wording .Ms. Grimes knew the question was coming , since shes fielded it several times in the last few days . The host of the debate , Bill Goodman , asked Ms. Grimes for whom shed voted in the 2012 presidential election . Ill take a wild guess here that Ms. Grimes , a Democrat who was a member of the Kentucky delegation to the Democratic National Convention two years ago , went for the Democrat : Barack Obama . But she refused to say  because shes petrified of being linked with the president , who is deeply unpopular in Kentucky . Instead , she took umbrage on the grounds that the Kentucky constitution guarantees ballot box secrecy . She actually made the preposterous claim that by ducking the question she was standing on constitutional principle .Mr. McConnell then made her look foolish by freely sharing his votes in the 2008 and 2012 presidential contests , as well as in the 2010 Senate race , when he voted for Trey Grayson , who lost to Rand Paul , the Tea Party darling .Mr. McConnell , whos been in Washington long enough 30 years  to know how to speak without communicating any information , had plenty of opportunity to show off his considerable obfuscation skills .Is the minimum wage a living wage , Mr. Goodman asked Mr. McConnell . Its an entry-level wage ,  said Mr. McConnell , hardly an answer .Is climate change real ? Before he could plead that he was not a scientist ,  Mr. Goodman pointed out that although the senator was not an economist , he was willing to share his opinions on the economy . In a tight spot , Mr. McConnell said : There are a bunch of scientists who feel there is a problem and maybe we can do something about it.Lest he be accused of siding with environmentalists , he added the caveat that scientists in the 1970s thought we were moving toward an ice age , and closed by declaring that his job , as United States Senator from Kentucky , was to fight for coal jobs in the state .Mr. McConnell approached Ms. Grimess ballot box secrecy-level of absurdity when Mr. Goodman asked him if Obamacare and Kynect had been a boon or bane for the state . The difficulty for Mr. McConnell is that the Affordable Care Act is politically toxic in Kentucky , while Kynect  which is the states health insurance program created under the Affordable Care Act  is a runaway success .Mr. McConnells attempt to separate the two made no sense . The Affordable Care Act should be pulled out root and branch. As for Kynect , thats just a website . It was paid for by a grant . The website can continue.Seeking clarity , Mr. Goodman asked if Mr. McConnell would support the continuation of Kynect . Yeah , I think its fine to have a website , yeah ,  said the senator .Thats like saying that Google should cease to exist but that Google.com should live on ."
-1	"Gail Collins : David , I was pretty confident that the United States had Ebola under control until the other day , when it appeared policy-making had devolved to Andrew Cuomo and Chris Christie . Chris Christie , who cant keep bridge traffic moving . Andrew Cuomo , who failed to get his 2012 flu shot until 2013 .David Brooks : This is why were a republic and not a democracy . People running for office should not be making science policy . By the way , Ive been against quarantines and overreaction through this whole thing , but there was a piece in The New Republic a few weeks ago that sobered me . Steven Beutler , an infectious disease specialist , was arguing for a maximalist response . Heres one core point : Medicine can be a very humbling profession , and after more than 30 years of practicing infectious-disease medicine , I have learned that the unanticipated happens all too often , especially where microbes are involved.Gail : Do you think the Ebola hysteria will have any effect on next weeks election ? Theres been a lot of complaint about the administrations ineptitude . But I think the message on Ebola , at least , has been the opposite . Ebola in the United States began deep in the heart of Texas , a state whose health care system is so estranged from the federal government it refuses to accept the opportunity to get its millions of uninsured residents covered under Obamacare .David : Your love of all things Texas is well known . But you have to admit a few things about the place . It is economically vibrant beyond all reckoning . Houston and Dallas are exploding economically while the rest of the country dawdles .Gail : Texas is the last gasp of the Sunbelt boom . It has all the advantages of warm weather , plus an enormous amount of space which makes housing stupendously cheap . It could have done just as well without being politically crazy .But we were talking about Ebola .David : As for Ebola and the election , my pretentious theory is that Ebola is the objective correlative of the campaign .Gail : Youre using big words again .David : If I remember high school English correctly , an objective correlative is an object that gives explicit access to the meaning of vague and insubstantial things , like a mood or an emotion . Its an object that correlates to a mood or emotion or idea . T.S . Eliot made it famous writing about Hamlet .Anyway , the country was already afraid . It felt like the people running things were not quite up to the job . Along comes a disease to perfectly embody that vague sense . That said , I dont think Ebola is swinging too many votes . People are just sour and they are disappointed with the president .Gail : It certainly has been a tough season for President Obama . But before we start blaming him for anything bad that happens next Tuesday , I would like to give him a shout-out for that hug-the-Ebola-nurse photo . Which allows us to recall that when AIDS hit the United States in 1981 , President Ronald Reagan was criminally useless . Never said a word . As Laura Helmuth noted in Slate this week , Reagans press secretary made fun of the idea that the president would ever consider speaking out .David : I totally agree with you on that one . Its not in the presidents job description to be the professional emoter and behavior model , but when he can display some truth by example , he might as well do it .Gail : I know Im preparing my defenses in advance of next week . But I think the American people have been saying they want an effective government , not a smaller government . All the candidates are promising theyre going to end gridlock , but if theres anything weve learned since Obama was elected , its that you dont end gridlock by sending more Tea Party types to Washington .David : I guess I think it is more generalized than that . They just dont trust government to get the job done . At least the federal government . Im struck by how amazingly stable polling has been on the Affordable Care Act . Democrats in swing states dont try to defend it . They just promise to fix it . The relatively good news on the health care front over the past year has done nothing to change minds .Gail : I find it sort of fascinating that the Republican Senate nominee in Iowa , who previously said shed support a law to have federal officials arrested for attempting to implement Obamacare , is marketing herself as the Iowa nice candidate who can work across the aisle .David : I find it shocking that Iowans should steal Minnesotas slogan . Minnesota is the nice state . Missouri is the skeptical state . New Jersey is the brash state . Iowa should be the quiet state .In her defense I think it is possible to arrest federal officials nicely . We call it compassionate conservatism .Gail : O.K. , this is the point at which were morally obliged to start making predictions . Whats yours ?David : I say this with no great confidence , but Im guessing the Republicans pick up eight seats . I think the biggest surprise will be a G.O.P . win in Georgia .Gail : That would make me sad , if only because Michelle Nunn has run such a good race and her opponent has been so terrible . It just seems unjust .My guess is that were not going to know who gets control of the Senate for a while . Some state is going to be so close therell be a recount . And Alaska takes forever to just get the ballots together . Plus Georgia and Louisiana , which will probably go to runoffs , since they require their senators to get a majority of the vote .David : Great ! Why shouldnt the decades most content-less campaign go into overtime ? Im sort of amazed that this election hasnt been about jobs and the economy . It hasnt been about anything but a sort of fatalism .Gail : Theres something about the idea of the fate of the nation hanging on Louisiana that makes me very nervous . I still remember being down there in 1991 , covering the gubernatorial runoff between the Ku Klux Klan wizard David Duke and the deeply corrupt ex-governor Edwin Edwards . The Edwards supporters had those bumper stickers saying : Vote for the Crook. Which , blessedly , the people did .David : Ill take an effective crook over an ineffective honest person any day .Gail : I should mention that at age 87 , Edwards is running for the House of Representatives this year . After getting out of jail , marrying a woman 51 years younger , and starring in a reality TV series . You cant say Louisiana isnt interesting . And if theres a runoff at least then wed be able to spend part of the winter in New Orleans . So much better than next year , when well be spending it in Des Moines .David : I was just in New Orleans last week . I love every street in that city except Bourbon Street , which is filled with terrible pizza places , extremely drunk idiots and teenagers mortified to be walking with their parents .Gong there makes me want to reread my favorite political novel of all time , Robert Penn Warrens All the Kings Men. Trollopes Phineas Finn is second .And dont knock Des Moines . Silence is golden .Gail : Whats the state youre following most closely ? I have to admit Kansas is pretty darned fascinating . If the Republicans have to ferry in any more old party stalwarts to shore up Senator Pat Roberts , theyll be resurrecting Alf Landon .I got a twinge watching Bob Dole campaign so vigorously for Roberts . Do you remember in 2012 when Dole was sitting in the Senate , in his wheelchair , watching his friends refuse to ratify the United Nations treaty on people with disabilities ? Which was based , of course , on the signature bill Dole got passed in 1990 when he was in the Senate .David : Somebody should please explain to me why senators dont ever want to retire . Whats fun about attending Ag Committee hearings when you are 84 ? Maybe the napping opportunities .Gail : I talked with Dole after the treaty vote , and he kept coming back to the fact that both of the Republican Senators from Kansas had voted against ratification . But theres Roberts now , in a deep ditch because he took his constituents so much for granted he didnt even bother to pretend he lived in their state . Dole clearly has a much deeper sense of loyalty .David : I once went to the Dole center in Kansas . Theyve got a sort of museum display about his life . The thing that moved me most was the exercise equipment he used to build himself back into shape after his war injury . He had wasted away to nothing and had to build himself all the way back . Then I got to see the basement where they keep all the presents he had been given by foreign dignitaries during his Senate years . There were carpets , saddles , baseball bats . People give politicians portraits of themselves . I guess thats called knowing your subject .Gail : Its interesting how many elections there are this year where voters seem to despise both candidates . If Floridians were any more alienated by their governors race , theyd have been bringing alligators to the debates .David : I dont think Floridians should be angry or alienated . It doesnt suit them . Among other things , it doesnt go with their pastels .Gail : I dont want anybody to imagine that Im making fun of other states because of my deep satisfaction with New York . Nothing is more humbling than spending a season covering New York politics . Where the phrase not yet indicted is regarded as a compliment .David : If Minnesota is nice and Iowa is quiet , what should New York be : Pompous ? Narcissistic ? I say this lovingly . It is my state too .Gail : Last question . Is there anything about this election thats really surprised you ? I didnt expect to see so much of Mitt Romney on the campaign trail . Do you think hes actually interested in running again ? They say third times a charm .David : Trust me . He isnt running . I think his wife sort of ruled that out . That documentary released after the election revealed him to be an authentically warm and nice guy . If there are three things that dont seem to work in politics these days its authenticity , niceness and warmth . Doesnt fit the national mood ."
-1	"The Kaiser Family Foundation has a new survey ( pdf ) on Obamacare in California , and its full of remarkably good news . For those who havent been following this , CA  with its now-dominant Democratic Party  is where Obamacare was implemented the way it was supposed to be implemented : the website worked pretty well from the beginning , Medicaid expansion was implemented , and the state worked hard on outreach . It was also a place that really needed reform : the uninsured were a high percentage of the population , and an individual market without community rating meant that the mere hint of a preexisting condition was enough to prevent coverage .So it now appears that most of Californias uninsured  58 percent of the total , or well over 60 percent of those eligible ( because undocumented immigrants arent covered ) have gained insurance in the first year . Considering the complexity of the scheme , thats really impressive , and it strongly suggests that next year , once those who missed out have had a chance to learn via word of mouth , California will have gotten much of the way toward universal coverage for legal residents .But theres something else the Kaiser report drives home : most of those gaining coverage are doing so not via the exchanges ( although those are important too ) but via Medicaid . And thats important as an answer to critics of Obamacare from the left .There have always been critics complaining that what we really should have is single-payer , and angry that subsidies were being funneled through the insurance companies . And in principle theyre right ; the trouble was that cutting the insurers out of the loop would have made the plan politically impossible , both because of the industrys power and because of the unwillingness of people with good coverage to take a leap into a completely new system . So we got this awkward public-private hybrid , which I supported because it was what we could get and despite its impurity it dramatically improves many peoples lives .But it turns out that many of the newly insured are in fact being covered under a single-payer system  Medicaid . And as Ive pointed out before,Medicaid is actually the piece of the US system that looks most like European health systems , which cost far less than ours while delivering comparable results .All in all , liberals really should be celebrating . California shows how Obamacare can and should work , and its looking pretty good ."
-1	"Greg Sargent notes that the midterm election , which was supposed to be a referendum on Obamacare , isnt looking at all like that in practice ; Republican ads denouncing health reform have been dwindling month by month .The reason is fairly obvious , although its not considered nice to state it bluntly : the attack on Obamacare depended almost entirely on lies , and those lies are becoming unsustainable now that the law is actually working . No , there arent any death panels ; no , huge numbers of Americans arent losing coverage or finding their health costs soaring ; no , jobs arent being killed in vast numbers . A few relatively affluent , healthy people are paying more for coverage ; a few high-income taxpayers are paying more in taxes ; a much larger number of Americans are getting coverage that was previously unavailable and/or unaffordable ; and most people are seeing no difference at all , except that they no longer have to fear what happens if they lose their current coverage .In other words , reform is working more or less the way it was supposed to ( except for the Medicaid expansion in non-cooperating states ) .Many of us argued all along that the rights chance to kill reform would vanish once the program was actually in place ; the horror stories only worked as long as the truth wasnt visible . And thats what seems to be happening ."
-1	"These are tough times for opponents of health care reform . They bet everything on a debacle , but Obamacare has failed to fail  and their efforts to deny the increasingly obvious success of the law are beginning to look ridiculous .Oh , and they cant come up with a conservative alternative ; Obamacare IS the conservative alternative , a way to achieve sorta-kinda universal coverage without single payer , and all of its main elements are essential parts of the package .So whats left ? Claims that guaranteed health insurance is an assault on Americas freedom .Bill Gardner at The Incidental Economist offers a rather decorous , mild reply to the people making this argument . Id put it more forcefully : the pre-ACA system drastically restricted many peoples freedom , because given the extreme dysfunctionality of the individual insurance market , they didnt dare leave jobs ( or in some cases marriages ) that came with health insurance . Now that affordable insurance is available even if you dont have a good job at a big company , many Americans will feel liberated  and this hugely outweighs the minor infringement on freedom caused by the requirement that people buy insurance . ( Also , if you dont like the mandate , why not support single payer ? )But no discussion of this latest argument should fail to mention the original insurance-is-slavery campaign  Operation Coffeecup , in which the AMA recruited doctors wives to gather their friends and listen to a recording of Ronald Reagan declaring that Medicare would destroy American liberty .Strange to say , that didnt happen . And Obamacare wont turn into a form of slavery , either . On the contrary , as I said , it will be a liberating force for many Americans ."
-1	"The good news for Obamacare just keeps coming in . Via Charles Gaba , the Rand Survey  which was the subject of a report in the LA Times , but which wasnt publicly available  is now in . And it says that as of mid-March  that is , before the final enrollment surge  the Affordable Care Act had already produced a net gain of 9.3 million insured adults . Again , thats a net gain ; so much for claims that more people are losing insurance than gaining it .At least some Republicans are realizing that ( a ) the ACA is not going to collapse and ( b ) they cant simply take away insurance from millions of Americans . So they have to come up with an alternative .And as Sahil Kapur reports , at least a few of them are coming to a terrible realization : there is no alternative . You cant just support the popular pieces of reform , in particular coverage for preexisting conditions , and scrap the rest . As Jonathan Gruber taught me , and I and others have said many times , reform is a three-legged stool that requires community rating , the individual mandate , and subsidies ; take away any leg and it collapses . And Kapur finds a GOP aide who admits to the awful truth : any workable GOP plan would look pretty much the same as Obamacare .I dont know how many GOP leaders , as opposed to aides , understand this . And even those who do wont dare to admit it . The party line , literally , has been that Obamacare is an unworkable monstrosity , and the base will destroy anyone who points out , this late in the game , that its both workable and pretty much the only doable alternative to single-payer .And if thats not a case of politics making people stupid , I dont know what is.."
-1	"On Monday , I wrote that the apparent stabilization of Obamacare sharpens the political and policy challenge facing the laws critics . Instead of the sort of easy unraveling that some Republicans had convinced themselves was in the offing , I argued ( in a point made rather more forcefully by Ramesh Ponnuru ) that its now much more likely that the only way the things conservatives dislike about Obamacare will ever change or go away is if conservatives actually unite around reforms or a replacement that sustains some of the current laws coverage expansion ( albeit on significantly different terms ) .My sense is that some Republicans half-agree . That is , theyre willing to concede that the party needs an Obamacare replacement thats more serious than some of the G.O.P.s circa-2009 alternatives . But they also think the law will remain so unpopular , and that the number of losers will exceed the number of winners so dramatically , that conservative policymakers will have more room to maneuver , in terms of the initial coverage numbers a replacement might sustain , than my reading of the situation would suggest .The health care reform proposal rolled out by Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal this week offers a specific example of how this perspective cashes out . Unlike some other recent Republican proposals ( most notably , the bill co-sponsored in the Senate earlier this year ) , which promise tax cuts and savings relative to current policy , Jindals proposal explicitly starts with the 2008 baseline , and promises not to tax or spend a dollar more . His proposed reform would convert the open-ended deduction for employer-provided insurance into a flat deduction , extend the same deduction to people outside the employer market , and channel $ 100 billion over ten years to the states to provide for high-risk pools and other measures to help cover people with pre-existing conditions . What it conspicuously wouldnt do is create the kind of tax credit for catastrophic coverage that youll often find in right-of-center health care alternatives  because that would cost money relative to the 2008 baseline , and/or require further disruptions elsewhere in the system . Which means , in turn , that if you replaced Obamacare with Jindalcare in 2017 , youd see a coverage expansion relative to the Bush era , but a large number of the newly-insured would lose coverage without any immediate prospect of regaining it .Jindal was in D.C. yesterday to talk about his plan ( full disclosure , I was there ) , and the Washington Examiners Philip Klein has a good write-up of how he responded to , shall we say , pushback on this point:Jindal was pressed on why he chose to offer a tax deduction for individuals to purchase insurance rather than a refundable tax credit . Supporters of the tax credit approach argue that it would benefit more people , because lower-income Americans dont pay enough taxes for the deduction to be valuable enough to make insurance premiums affordable .He said that he decided on the deduction approach because relying on tax credits would be so costly that it would require tax increases  and Jindal doesnt want his plan to spend more or tax more than the system that existed prior to Obamacares passage . He also argued that credits would cause more disruption to the employer-based market and would be more prone to fraud .He said that whatever amounts of money conservatives were willing to allocate to address a problem , Democrats would always be willing to spend more , so conservatives can not get into a bidding war .Jindal cited previous estimates of similar reform proposals to his own , which he said could reduce family health insurance premiums by $ 5,000 annually and increase coverage by 9 million people relative to the number of people who were covered prior to Obamacare .I dont think conservative health care reform is about saying were going to compete with them in terms of how many people we say have an insurance card ,  he said . Thats not the ultimate goal.So obviously the governor and I have a substantive disagreement here : Like Jindal , Im deeply skeptical of the give everyone a Medicaid card approach to health care reform , but that skepticism pushes me toward supporting a basic catastrophic protection ( and other reforms ) instead , rather than toward just accepting , for the foreseeable future , a health insurance marketplace that prices a lot of working class Americans out of affordable coverage of any sort .But for the purposes of this post , Im more interested in the politics of the debate . Politically , I dont think theres any question that Jindals argument  go back to the pre-Obamacare baseline , expand coverage modestly relative to that  would play well with at least part of the G.O.P . electorate in a primary campaign . For a case , contra myself and Ponnuru , that it could also play pretty well in the general election and in a subsequent legislative battle , heres Ben Domenech , writing in yesterdays edition of his newsletter The Transom: when President Obama sold his health care law to the American people , he sold it to them primarily on the basis of cost . He did this because the polling was so unanimous : people werent demanding massive increased regulation of the insurance marketplace to achieve any particular moral goal about coverage levels or anything of the sort  the vast majority of Americans just cared that their premiums cost too much . So Obama made the case for his law based not on increasing coverage , but on decreasing costs  and along the way , he promised that no one would lose their doctor , their plan , or see worse coverage because of his law . In each case , his case was in line with the polling data on what the American people wanted .But what about making the case for health policy reforms in the post-Obamacare era ? For most center-right health policy experts and opinion-makers , the assumption has taken hold that coverage levels must be sustained or even increased under any comparable reform . They believe the argument in favor of universal coverage has been lost , and that any plan which kicks people off of an entitlement program is doomed to fail , politically .This is an assumption held by most people in Washington and the media . But I wonder how accurate it is . Post-Obamacare polling data on this question is lacking , but given the behavior of so many individuals and entities in reaction to Obamacare its possible that the bulk of Americans still hold the same views they did prior to the laws passage : that they want to retain their current plans , that they dislike disruption in their insurance experience , but that most of all , they want lower costs for themselves , not broader coverage for everybody else .I agree that support for universal coverage has tended to be soft , rising when it seems theoretical and then diminishing when the trade-offs actually present themselves . But my expectation is that with Obamacare in place , the psychology of loss aversion changes this calculus in two ways . First , indirectly  because it seems worse to most people to lose a benefit than to have never enjoyed it , voters will feel more morally uncomfortable supporting a candidate who promises to strip other peoples coverage than they would have felt voting for a candidate who opposed the expansion originally . And second , directly  because over the next few years , even voters who dislike Obamacare and arent getting subsidies are likely to internalize the idea that they now have an additional backstop in the event of job-loss or illness , and so voting to roll the program back completely and start afresh without that backstop will , again , be more unpopular than never creating it in the first place would have been . ( The consistent presence , in most polls , of an anti-Obamacare demographic that prefer changes to outright repeal suggests to me that the idea of maintaining some kind of quasi-universal guarantee has relatively strong appeal . )Id also make a broader point : Yes , the health care law remains unpopular , but it was unpopular in 2012 as well , and the economy was worse , and the Republican nominee still went down to defeat  not least , I would submit , because of the perception that he couldnt be trusted to safeguards the interests of the non-rich . So even if people generally care more about cost than coverage , it still seems quite likely that this fatal impression of the partys priorities would be accentuated , rather than diminished , in a 2016 campaign where the Republican nominee would be quite directly promising to drive the uninsured rate up .My expectation could be confounded , I concede , if the next few years are a true disaster of spiking premiums and stagnant newly-insured numbers . And I would certainly agree with Domenech that the structure of the law is a lot more vulnerable than exuberant liberals seem to think this week .But I also think that in political terms , its actually slightly crazy for Republicans to bet this way given the other options available to them . The Jindal theory , that the right shouldnt bother competing with liberals on certain policy fronts because theyll always be outbid , is generally problematic ( why does his proposal have any coverage expansion , then ? ) but its a particularly odd idea to embrace in a case where the liberal program may not , as even its defenders allow , actually end up delivering the scale of coverage expansion that was expected .By which I mean that if the current enrollment trends persist , there is a good chance that some version of a more catastrophic-focused reform could actually enroll somewhat more Americans in some kind of basic coverage than Obamacare , at a substantially lower cost . ( A preliminary private score of the Senate Republican bill suggested it could get slightly higher coverage numbers , and that was  I believe  using the C.B.O . projections for Obamacare , which may turn out to have been too high . ) Which in turn would offer Republicans an opportunity to effectively outbid the Democrats on enrollment while significantly underbidding them on spending . ( The Democrats could , of course , counter with single-payer  but the G.O.P . should want to provoke that debate ! ) And to pass up that unusual opportunity in favor of a probably-doomed fidelity to a nearly decade-old baseline  well , I suppose it would be very much like the Republican Party Ive come to know and love so well ."
-1	"Gail Collins : David , youve been enthusiastic about the Senate race in Kansas , where an independent , Greg Orman , became a surprise front-runner . Now the same kind of thing seems to be happening in South Dakota . Are you excited ?David Brooks : Have you ever heard of negative panic ? In times of chaos or extreme excitement , before a fire or an oncoming tornado , some people act with extreme calm , as if everything is normal . Their brains just dont know how to handle the extreme circumstances so they pretend those circumstances dont exist . Many people die because they dont take the simple evasive action that would save their lives .I am so excited by the prospect of an independent candidate in South Dakota that I am behaving as if everything is normal . I give off the appearance of extreme calm . But deep down Im rippling with excitement . Next to me John Thune and Tom Daschle seem manic .Gail : I may have gotten carried away . I remember now that I recently humiliated myself by announcing how thrilled I was by a Senate candidate debate in Iowa .But weve only got three more weeks of this election season , so you have to humor me . In South Dakota , Mike Rounds , the Republican Senate candidate , was supposed to win . Then he got mired in a scandal . Its one of those extremely complicated matters that we in the media try to summarize with a phrase like allegations of corruption.David : Do you know that South Dakota was the last state among the 48 that I have visited ? Now Ive been there a few times . What impresses me about the place is that the eastern and western sides of the state are rivals with each other . Youd think that there would be so much resentment north/south in the Dakotas that they wouldnt have time for east/west . I guess the winters are long .I dont know why I mention this except that I think people would be more forgiving toward Mike Rounds if there was more of a love-thy-neighbor mentality .Gail : Well , Rounds hasnt run any attack ads because he feels South Dakotans dont like that tone . Although to be fair , until recently he didnt think he had any competition . People who are basically running unopposed love the high road .The Democrat , Rick Weiland , has been running as a populist-liberal , and until recently the national party rewarded him for his principled candidacy by ignoring his race entirely . Then Larry Pressler , a former Republican senator now turned independent , began to get traction . Now anything seems possible .David : I love the fact that Pressler is back , once again disproving the most untrue truism in American literature , that there are no second acts in American life .Gail : Oh my gosh , I totally agree with you . Bill Clinton alone has had about fifteen second acts .David : Pressler is on his seventh or eighth act . The guy was a Rhodes Scholar , a Vietnam vet . He first entered Congress before Jimmy Carter was president . Thats a long time ago . He was also the senator who came off looking good during the Abscam scandal . Heres a passage from a 1980 Washington Post story:Thanks to the F.B.I.s undercover sting operation , there now exists incontrovertible evidence that one senator would not be bought . Preserved among the videotape footage that may be used as bribery evidence against a number of members of Congress , there is a special moment in which Sen. Larry Pressler ( R-SD ) tells the undercover agents , in effect , to take their sting and stick it . Pressler , according to law enforcement sources , was the one approached member of Congress who flatly refused to consider financial favors in exchange for legislative favors , as suggested by undercover agents posing as Arabs . At the time he said he was not aware that he was doing anything quite so heroic.Gail : I do love listening to you read the news . And you brought back Abscam ! Its comforting , at minimum , to know there was at least one senator who didnt immediately buy the phony-sheikh hustle .David : So yes , I guess I have a soft spot for a guy like that who wants to re-enter the Senate . That said , I think it will be hard to stay up in the polls once the other guys set their sights on him .Gail : So we agree South Dakota is  yes !  exciting . And I know you like the idea of electing bipartisan independents .Heres what worries me about that . There are already two official independents in the Senate , Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine . Suppose we wound up with a Senate that was 48-48-4 ? If the independents formed their own little caucus , theyd have the deciding votes on everything . The fate of every bill and nomination would depend on four guys from Kansas , South Dakota , Vermont and Maine . Four people whose states represent less than 2 percent of the American population .David : Are you worried about this because the United States Senate is not a model of legislative excellence ? I of course think the Senate is way more polarized than the country so it would be a good thing to have a little ballast in the center . Even if that ballast does come from extremely even-tempered states .Gail : Do you think South Dakotans will be troubled by the fact that the independent Senate candidate Larry Pressler seems to actually live in Washington , D.C ? At least he rents an apartment in Sioux Falls , which is more than Pat Roberts , the endangered Kansas senator , bothered to do .David : I wished all senators lived in D.C. Congress worked better when its members couldnt fly home every week . I dont think its the time at home that ruins them ; its the airport food .I know people like me are always saying this , but I do think if members of the Senate were here for more than three days at a stretch they would actually learn to like each other a little more . Plus , members of Congress are not primarily in office to directly represent their constituents ; they are in Congress to offer their best judgments on the issues of the day .Gail : Well , sort of . Until the budget or the farm bill comes out , and everybodys trying to figure out what it means to the folks in East Cupcake .We do have a lot of close races that are roiled by residency issues this year . Besides South Dakota and Kansas , theres Louisiana , where Senator Mary Landrieus official state residence is in her parents house . And in Alaska , the Republican Senate candidate is getting criticized for having what might be called shallow Alaskan roots .David : Weve got to start paying these people more . With Washington real estate prices shooting toward N.Y.C . levels , its expensive to maintain a home there and a house back in the home state . I really think this residency business is a crazy issue .Gail : Maybe we could put up dorms . Nice big ones like colleges have for married graduate students .This is the point at which I get nostalgic and recall that in one of the first elections I ever covered , one of the big issues was whether the voting address of the incumbent was actually a North Haven , Connecticut , Burger King outlet .David : I didnt know Chris Christie began his career in Connecticut .Gail : Ach , low blow .But it still seems to me that people are better off choosing between two parties that have reasonably clear , competing agendas  plus the ability , at least in theory , to deliver on some of their promises .David : If one party or another had a total grip on the truth Id agree with you . Hard issues usually require a balancing between competing values and competing legitimate interests . Independents , if they know their job , can help find this balance . If they dont know their job they just waffle in the middle .Gail : Well , I do admit that the last several seasons in Washington have not done a whole lot for my let-the-parties-deliver theory .David : So true .Gail : Maybe the good news from this election season is that Obamacare is fading as an issue . Can you foresee a time when the House will give up voting several dozen times a season to repeal it and actually start working with the other party to fix its weak spots ?I dont want to force your opinion , but maybe I should point out that there are a lot of us who would grab onto a positive response as a tiny glimmer of hope in an otherwise hopeless election season .David : Sorry . I do think health care inflation is declining , which is fabulous news , either because of Obamacare or some other reason . But Im afraid this issue will be with us forever . When Larry Pressler stages his next comeback in 2056 , well still be talking about it ."
-1	"As we await an official presidential response to last nights Democratic debacle , here are two quotes that seem likely to frame the political classs discussion of how the president might respond . First , from Politico , days before the drubbing , when the White House could still hope for just a modest setback at the polls:Administration officials tell us that Obamas political and policy teams are planning a big counterattack if the Republicans win the Senateintroducing a slate of legislative proposals and executive actions on immigration , infrastructure and early childhood education that are popular with the Democratic base and that he will dare the GOP to oppose .And second , from an anonymous Dem bigwig talking to Business Insider last night:"
-1	"I love voting . I love pretty much everything about it . My polling place is and has been for many years the Alfred E. Smith School , P.S . 163 , an elementary school . The voting booths are arrayed around a mottled , parquet gym floor , and there are always mothers running a bake sale outside to raise money for the school .Up until a few years ago , we voted on huge , metal machines that seemed like relics from the first days of the industrial age . Exercising the franchise was a pleasing combination of sacred civic ritual and theatricality . You waited in line , gave your name , signed the voting rolls , then were ushered behind a curtain that you closed by slamming a red-handled lever big enough to have served as a prop in Modern Times to one side . You flicked more mechanical switches to choose your candidates behind the curtain  a rare oasis of total privacy out in public Manhattan . You could even change your mind and flip them back , at least until the end , when you gave the lever a satisfying slam back the other way , and the curtain slid open . You half-expected the Wizard of Oz to appear .Now that was casting a vote !Thats all changed , thanks to our supposed concern about voter fraud . Since New York instituted its new , computerized voting system , the way things work are as follows : We line up to give our names and get a ballot . We then go a second line for the next available , barely private voting booth  in reality a table with a sort of sneeze guard around three sides . When were finished , we line up a third time to run our ballots through the next available computer , which assures us that our votes have been registered as we wanted , although who can possibly say . Knowing how protected vital American computer systems are against hackers , Im waiting for the Election Day the screen tells me my candidate is stuck in Nigeria , and desperately needs a money order to get home and take office .The whole process not only takes three lines  something New Yorkers just love  and is barely private . Volunteers at the polls can easily see whom you voted for at the computers , and often must run the ballots through the scanners for the more elderly or infirm voters . So much for the sanctity of the ballot . The bake sales are still great , though .The lines were fairly sparse at the Smith school today , which inevitably led me to think back to the very long lines and the wild enthusiasm that imbued our first opportunity to vote for Barack Obama for president , in 2008 .All politics is national now , which made this midterm election yet another referendum on President Obama , and it has turned out to be another overwhelming repudiation of the president , who already suffered one debacle back in 2010 .This appears to have been a baffling rejection to this supremely detached president , whose supporters have been protesting that the public just does not appreciate all he has done  a list that invariably includes Obamacare , a revived stock market and an unemployment mark that has inched slowly downward .What the White House doesnt seem to appreciate is just how little a dent this has made in the devastating loss of wealth , security and opportunity so many Americans have experienced in the last few years . But this administration has also been afflicted almost from the start with the inability to decide just whom it is trying to appeal to .Like Bill Clinton before him , this New Democrat president early on dismissed traditional liberals as professional leftists as his first press secretary once put it . But just a few months ago he also let his new F.C.C . chairman suggest an end to net neutrality , and his secretary of education heartily endorse the decision of a Republican judge ending teacher tenure , in which said judge claimed there are a significant number of grossly ineffective teachers currently active in California classrooms.Well , which is it ? Are you trying to build the new , white-collar Democratic Party or not , and if so , where do you expect these people to come from ?This sort of confusion about practical politics has long bedeviled New Democrats . And in fairness , we did let the president down , after that cool , cool fall day in 2008 . The sorts of sweeping , groundbreaking reforms we were hoping for  the change we could believe in  has never been accomplished from the top down in America , but has always meant a president gathering up the strands of many useful ideas and experiments , and working with the power , and often the hands , feet , elbows and knees , of grass-roots movements at his back .Franklin D. Roosevelts leading advisers , Harry L. Hopkins , Frances Perkins , Harold L. Ickes and Henry A. Wallace , among others , had labored long in the trenches on crucial issues of social welfare , labor rights , and land and farm preservation . The Tennessee Valley Authority came out of a decades-long struggle for public power , by Senator George W. Norris . No one in the Congress or Mr. Obamas cabinet has provided anything like this sort of counsel , or experience .Nor has there been anything like the sorts of longstanding , populist , militant farm and labor movements that put the New Deal over . In the turmoil of the 1930s , worker uprisings literally took over waterfronts , factories , department stores and even the city of Minneapolis . Occupy Wall Street took over Zuccotti Park , then evaporated . It takes more than that  more than casting a vote every couple of years  to make change ."
-1	"Now that Obamacare has finished with an amazing surge in signups , apparently passing the 7 million mark for the exchanges , there have been two main responses . Republicans are in full-on denial  the books are cooked ! Nobody has paid ! Its only because people have been forced to do it ! Benghazi ! Vince Foster ! Meanwhile , progressives are full of caution . Its just a start , we dont know how well this will work in the longer run , too soon to celebrate .The right-wing reaction is , of course , ludicrous . But the cautious progressives are being too cautious . This really is what Joe Biden would have called a Big Frothing Deal , or something like that .The key question you need to ask is , what would make Obamacare fail if it did fail ?Contrary to what the right has been saying , theres nothing at all wrong with the concept of a government guarantee of health insurance  every other advanced country does it , and they all have much cheaper care than we do . The question , instead , was whether the compromises made to get past the political barriers to universal insurance had produced a system too complex to work .Ive always thought of Obamacare as a sort of Rube Goldberg device that awkwardly simulates the results of a single-payer system . Its run through private insurance companies in part to buy off the industry , in part to let most people with good insurance keep it . It relies on a mandate plus subsidies , rather than full funding via the tax system , in part to keep down the headline spending number . And so on . The resulting system isnt what anyone would design from scratch ; it was , however , probably the only kind of system we could get .So , the risk was that it would be too Rube Goldbergy  that it would be too hard to get the system up and running , that people wouldnt hear about their options or be able to navigate their way through the choices available . And for a while , with the botched website , it looked as if this worst-case scenario was coming true .But now we know : despite the initial botch , despite difficulty getting the word out to Latinos and others , we have a lot of people signing up . And that was the hard part . When the next signup window opens , even more of the bugs will have been worked out , and many people who didnt sign up for 2014 will be hearing word-of-mouth stories about the benefits .Weve had proof of concept , and that means were over the hump . This was a very big day ."
-1	"Whenever Barack Obama seems in danger of falling , do we have to hear that George W. Bush made the cliff ?It happened with the economy . For the presidents staunchest defenders , legitimate questions about whether the stimulus was wisely crafted and whether Obamacare was rushed took a back seat to lamentations over the damage that his predecessor had done . Obama wasnt perfect , but at least he wasnt Bush .And with the Middle East , those defenders sometimes turn Bushs epic mistakes into Obamas hall pass . Perhaps he hasnt figured out whats right , but he isnt guilty of the original wrong , which is constantly being litigated anew , as if a fresh verdict on the events of 2003 could alter the challenges and stakes of 2014 .On Tuesday there was another spasm of this . As Congress debated the escalation of airstrikes against Islamic extremists , Representative Lloyd Doggett , a Texas Democrat , digressed to inveigh against the wholly unnecessary Bush-Cheney invasion of Iraq ,  a bell that was rung 11 1/2 years ago and cant be un-rung now .And to judge from my inbox lately and the chatter I overhear , what matters to many of Obamas most stalwart fans isnt whether he erred in the way he spoke of those extremists , turned his attention to them quickly enough or is now confronting them with the correct dose of belligerence : not too little , not too much .At least hes not Bush . He didnt hallucinate weapons of mass destruction , make a spurious case for war or condone torture . I hear so much about Bushs failings and Bushs sins that youd think he were still huddled over a desk in Washington rather than dabbing at a canvas in Texas .Enough . Its true that Obama hasnt replicated Bushs offenses , and its consoling . But it isnt exactly reason for a parade , and it doesnt inoculate him . The culpability that lies elsewhere doesnt relieve the responsibilities that are now his .And not being as bad as someone else is hardly the same as being good . Obama can rise far above Bush and still fall short . The presidency isnt The Voice ( though it is a little like Survivor ) . Youre not judged only in relation to the other performers whove been on stage . Youre judged by how well you respond to the unique circumstances of your time and place  by your ability to clean up the mess , not whether you made it .This not-as-bad-as defense is a pointless partisan tic . Weve seen a lot of it over the course of this presidency and will no doubt see a lot of it during the next , be it Democratic or Republican .The I.R.S . scandal was not as bad as Watergate . ( Nothings ever as bad as Watergate , which serves a nifty historical function as the gold standard of executive malfeasance and mendacity . )The bungled rollout of Obamacare was not as bad as the botched response to Katrina .Its apples and hurricanes , but theyre put in the same basket , in a manner that recalls a child trying to evade punishment by ratting out a sibling for something worse . Dont be mad , Mommy , about Operation Fast and Furious and all those guns that ended up with Mexican drug cartels . Ronnie traded arms for hostages as part of this whole Iran-contra affair !I sometimes like to imagine presidential campaigns waged along these lines and what the candidates not-as-bad-as bumper stickers might say .Fewer Lies Than Nixon. Fewer Sweaters Than Carter. Fewer Interns Than Clinton. Better Speller Than Quayle.It works in the other direction , too , and Obama has definitely suffered plenty of not-as-good-as slings . Former presidents are held up not merely as yardsticks ; theyre rulers used to rap the knuckles of the Oval Offices current inhabitant and beat him over the head .Smack : That Teddy Roosevelt certainly understood the power of the bully pulpit ! Thwack : That L.B.J . really knew how to schmooze ! A president is like a second spouse living in the saintly shadow of a first one who perished too soon .George Santayana famously said that those who dont know history are destined to repeat it . But are those who fixate on it blind to how peculiar the present is , and to the fact that no degree of longing for a lost hero or blaming of a departed villain is going to change what lies ahead ?If were determined to glance back at a figure who flatters Obama , lets really have at it and look all the way to Warren Harding . Golf wasnt his only distraction . He also had a thing for poker . And when it came to seeming and feeling overwhelmed , the 29th president , an Ohio Republican , reputedly confessed to friends that he was lost in the job .By that measure Obama is a rock . But it doesnt make him a boulder ."

It has no relationship whatsoever to the sophisticated analysis of rich data sets for which Nate Silver himself has become famous .The problem with the new FiveThirtyEight is not one of data vs. theory . It is one of data the buzzword vs. data the actual thing .So what would real data-driven reporting look like ( beyond what goes on at the sites Noah mentions , and also at the Times ) ? Well , heres an example : Charles Gabas ACASignups.net . Gaba , a website developer , realized that nobody was systematically keeping track of enrollment data for Obamacare , and has turned himself into one-stop shopping on the laws progress . And he really fills a need : when you read news reports on Obamacare , you can tell right away which reporters have been reading Gaba and know whats happening and which reporters are relying solely on official announcements  or , worse , dueling political spin .For the record , Gabas take on the program so far is fairly optimistic : he projects 6.3 million signups by March 31 , and has very carefully debunked claims that the vast majority of those signing up were previously insured . But the main point is that hes filling a niche by using a lot more data than the mainstream media . Thats what we thought Nate Silver would be doing , and maybe he eventually will . But for now , Gaba is the model ."
-1	"Three blog posts and a column should probably suffice to cover the debate over Obamacare and work incentives , but I dont want to let the topic drop without first stepping back and talking about the actual health policy disagreement here . My column and posts last week criticized what struck me as a kind of insouciance from liberals about this issue , shading into a post-work utopianism that doesnt wrestle with what , in practice , the decline of work is actually likely to mean for issues of class , mobility , and social equality . But its also important to recognize that for many liberal writers , the controlling assumption here is not anti-work or pro-work . Its just pro-universal health care as a basic standard for a decent society , with the consequences taken as they come .I would prefer that this perspective was accompanied by less chatter about how the only people working less because of Obamacare will be The Most Hardworking Amazing Moms in America , and fewer suggestions that its indecent and unpatriotic to worry about how welfare policy influences economic decision-making . But stripped of the Panglossian window dressing , its entirely reasonable to believe that some public goods are too important to be withheld just because they might have a few perverse consequences . ( I can certainly think of a few policies I would support even if they took a bite out workforce participation . )At least where the center-left is concerned , then , if you dig deep enough into the work-incentives debate youll hit the same old argument about the importance of universal comprehensive insurance . Thats why you keep seeing Obamacares defenders argue that the laws income effect  where people work less because theyre getting insurance benefits at a much-reduced cost  is mostly fine , because we dont want people having to work to afford a basic good like health insurance . And its why , when they talk about the substitution effect  the way the the subsidy phase-out creates an effective marginal tax that discourages working longer hours or taking a higher-paying job  they usually concede the existence of a problem , but then argue that the best way to solve it would be to extend Obamacares existing benefit further up the income ladder , or make it universal  in each case , at an expense that conservatives would inevitably oppose .Whats being implicitly ruled out , in both cases , is the possibility that government should be subsidizing insurance , but also subsidizing less of it than Obamacare does , and that the scope of the existing insurance model is making both the income and the substitution effects larger than they need to be . This is basically the theory behind the most plausible conservative alternative  a flat subsidy for catastrophic coverage  to the health care law we actually got . And though liberals mostly reject it , I think its a theory worth entertaining even if you believe absolutely in the kind of redistribution inherent in Obamacare  because even granted the pro-redistribution premise its still not obvious that subsidizing comprehensive insurance is the best way to go about it .Think about it this way . The welfare state delivers a basket of subsidies to lower-income Americans . Some of these subsidies take the form of cash , and some are direct subsidies for various goods ( food , housing , health insurance ) . Some are tied to work  the earned income tax credit is the notable example  and some of them are not . Pre-Obamacare , the main subsidy for health insurance was tied to work , which both conservatives and liberals tend to regard as a less-than-ideal design ; it was also open-ended and regressive , making it a lousy deal for low-income Americans , period .So we can agree that we should be transitioning away from that model . But theres no necessary reason why , in the course of that transition , we should just set the new health care share of the low-income basket at the levels suggested by the existing insurance model , when that model plainly isnt delivering value for those dollars overall . Maybe , instead , it would make more sense to take some of the money that Obamacare spends chasing the goal of comprehensive coverage and spend it , say , on giving single workers some of the same E.I.T.C . benefits as families . Or on a larger child tax credit . Or on a straightforward payroll tax cut . Or  to pick a liberal cause , instead of a reform conservative idea  new experiments in universal pre-kindergarten !If severing health insurance from work inevitably reduces workforce participation , that doesnt mean we shouldnt gradually sever it , and seek to subsidize insurance in a different way . But it means that we should think seriously about what else we should be doing , and whether we should be spending as much as Obamacare spends on insurance when there are other transfers that might not offer as many work disincentives , might give a stronger boost to upward mobility , and might do more long-term good .On the last point , I dont want to rehearse the entire debate about catastrophic versus comprehensive coverage , and the good that health insurance does or doesnt do . Ill just note two recent items that I think are relevant to this debate . The first is a big Times story , running today:One of the largest and most meticulous studies of mammography ever done , involving 90,000 women and lasting a quarter-century , has added powerful new doubts about the value of the screening test for women of any age .It found that the death rates from breast cancer and from all causes were the same in women who got mammograms and those who did not . And the screening had harms : One in five cancers found with mammography and treated was not a threat to the womans health and did not need treatment such as chemotherapy , surgery or radiation .The study , published Tuesday in The British Medical Journal , is one of the few rigorous evaluations of mammograms conducted in the modern era of more effective breast cancer treatments . It randomly assigned Canadian women to have regular mammograms and breast exams by trained nurses or to have breast exams alone .Researchers sought to determine whether there was any advantage to finding breast cancers when they were too small to feel . The answer is no , the researchers report .The second is a study published this month in the Journal of Development Economics . Heres the executive summary:We examine the impact of removing user fees for healthcare in rural Ghana using data from a randomized experiment that includes rich information on objective measures of child health status . We find that free care increased use of formal healthcare shifting care seeking away from informal providers , with particularly strong effects for children who were anaemic at baseline . There was no health effect on the intervention population taken overall . [ emphasis mine  R.D . ] However , consistent with the utilization findings , there were health improvements amongst those with anaemia initially . Further benefits included a large reduction in health spending , with the effect greater at higher levels of the medical spending distribution . Free care was found to have no influence on a range of malaria prevention behaviours or on the incidence of self-reported illness , suggesting that ex-ante moral hazard is unlikely to be a concern in this particular setting .If you want a reason to doubt the wisdom of redistribution-via-insurance , these are the places to start : In the evidence , widespread and accumulating , that what we spend on medical treatment  and what the government spends for us  does not have a clear connection to how healthy we are and how long we live .This evidence does not make the case for excluding health insurance , and the financial protection it supplies , when you design a safety net . But it does make a case against Obamacare as designed , especially given some of the trade-offs that design requires . And it makes a positive case for deploying resources somewhat differently , focusing more on the nexus of work and money income , and spending less on a benefit that can only be spent in ways that dont seem to be producing the promised results ."
-1	"CONVENTIONAL wisdom holds that firearms are the preserve of conservative white men . You would never know this at my local shooting range , which happens to be in a majority African-American area , and has a clientele that reflects that fact . There , as a white man , Im often in the minority ; just one more guy who likes to fire weapons  another person to chat to and share stories with . It is , Id venture , how things should be .By rights , the Second Amendment should serve as a totem of African-Americans full citizenship and enfranchisement . For centuries , firearms have been indispensable to black liberation : as crucial a defense against tyranny for Frederick Douglass and Martin Luther King Jr. as for Sam Adams and George Washington . Today , however , many black Americans have a decidedly mixed relationship with the right to bear arms .In August , as the outrage over the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson , Mo. , dominated the news , an African-American group calling itself the Huey P. Newton Gun Club took to the streets of Dallas , rifles in hand , to protest . Local businesses were supportive , and the citys police chief confirmed in a statement that his department supports the constitutional rights of all. On Twitter , the hashtag # blackopencarry prompted a warm response from conservatives .And yet , that same month , a 22-year-old black man named John Crawford III was shot dead by the police in an Ohio Walmart after a white customer claimed excitedly that a man was pointing a gun at his fellow patrons . Later , the stores security footage revealed that Mr. Crawford had been holding a BB gun that he had picked up in the sporting goods department , and that the callers testimony had been wrong . Ohio is an open carry state . That didnt make much difference for Mr. Crawford .Until around 1970 , the aims of Americas firearms restrictionists and the aims of Americas racists were practically inextricable . In both the colonial and immediate post-Revolutionary periods , the first laws regulating gun ownership were aimed squarely at blacks and Native Americans . In both the Massachusetts and Plymouth colonies , it was illegal for the colonists to sell guns to natives , while Virginia and Tennessee banned gun ownership by free blacks .In the antebellum period , the chief justice of the United States , Roger B. Taney , wrote a grave warning into the heart of the execrable Dred Scott decision . If blacks were permitted to become citizens , Taney cautioned , they , like whites , would have full liberty to keep and carry arms wherever they went.White Southerners would eventually be forced to accept blacks as their fellow citizens . But old habits died hard . After the Civil War , many Southern states enacted Black Codes to prohibit ownership of guns by blacks . The measures served their purpose . In her remarkable 1892 disquisition on the evils of lynching , the writer Ida B . Wells noted that the only times an Afro-American who was assaulted got away has been when he had a gun and used it in self-defense. Wells offered some blunt advice : a Winchester rifle should have a place of honor in every black home , and it should be used for that protection which the law refuses to give.At the height of the civil rights movement , black freedom fighters took Wellss counsel seriously . Although he was denied a concealed-carry permit , the Rev . Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. had what his adviser Glenn E. Smiley described as a veritable arsenal at home .Far from being a digression from the principle of nonviolence , this willingness to defend oneself was heir to a long , proud tradition . Considering in 1850 what he believed to be the best response to the Fugitive Slave Act , Frederick Douglass proposed : a good revolver.The first major ban on the open carrying of firearms  a Republican-led bill that was drafted after Black Panthers began hanging around the State Legislature in Sacramento with their guns on display  was signed in 1967 by none other than Gov . Ronald Reagan of California . The federal Gun Control Act of 1968 was primarily a reaction to the scourge of Saturday night specials  cheap handguns owned by the poor and the black . The National Rifle Association opposed neither law .So the fact that one of the seminal Second Amendment cases in American history is named for a black plaintiff is a beautiful and moving thing indeed . McDonald v. Chicago , argued in 2010 , was brought by Otis McDonald , a 76-year-old black man tired of watching his neighborhood give way to crime and gang warfare . The Supreme Court ruled 5 to 4 that the Second Amendment applied not just to all people , but to the states as well as to the federal government , and that Chicago was therefore not permitted to prohibit Mr. McDonald from keeping a handgun for his defense .Yet African-American activists typically refrain from involvement in the issue of gun rights . In October 2013 , Shaneen Allen , 27 , a black single mother of two , was arrested in New Jersey for carrying a firearm without a license ( she was under the impression that her Pennsylvania concealed-carry permit was accepted across state lines ) , and threatened with a prison sentence of up to 11 years for her mistake .But it was conservative publications , such as my own National Review , and the N.R.A . that came to her defense . The N.A.A.C.P . and the usual champions remained unusually quiet . ( There was no news conference featuring the Rev . Al Sharpton . ) They have been largely absent , too , from the case of Marissa Alexander , a black Florida woman given a 20-year sentence for firing a warning shot near her abusive husband .Its a problem of perception , an assumption that the Second Amendment is the province of whites , that cuts both ways . In 2009 , as the first Tea Party rallies swept the country , Contessa Brewer of MSNBC showed a video of a man at an anti-Obamacare rally with a pistol on his hip and suggested that there are questions about whether this has racial overtones ... white people showing up with guns. Later , it came out that the man in the video was actually black .At least 15 percent of African-Americans report that they own guns  about the same rate as all other nonwhites. But as anybody who has attended an N.R.A . convention can attest , there is a gaping hole in the organizations membership . Look around the convention center and you will see plenty of women , a good number of Asians and Hispanics , and even a smattering of children . Blacks ? Not so much .This is a tremendous shame . It is one thing for the N.R.A . to celebrate black Second Amendment advocates such as its spokesman Colion Noir , and Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. of Milwaukee County , but it is quite another for Wayne LaPierre to inveigh against home invaders , drug cartels , carjackers , knockout gamers , and rapers , and haters ,  and for the camera to then pan around a sea of white faces clapping in unison .Malcolm X may have a deservedly mixed reputation , but the famous photograph of him standing at the window , rifle in hand , insisting on black liberation by any means necessary ,  is about as American as it gets . It should be celebrated just like the Dont tread on me Gadsden flag . By not making that connection , the movement is losing touch with one of its greatest triumphs and forsaking a prime illustration of why its cause is so just and so crucial .If supporters of the right to keep and bear arms want their pleas to be heard in their proper context , they might consider talking a little less about Valley Forge and a little more about Jim Crow  and attempting to fill their ranks with people who have known much more recently what tyranny really looks like ."
-1	"Sorry about blog silence  real life intruded , plus I did have to write a column . But I shouldnt let the day pass without mentioning the latest big Obamacare news . Final enrollment for 2014 , we now know , will be more than 8 million . The age mix has also improved , with more young people signing up at the end ; as Jonathan Cohn points out in the linked article , the age mix in Obamacares first year is now just about identical to the age mix in Romneycares first year . Goodbye , death spiral .How did enrollment manage to surge so impressively despite the initial debacle of healthcare.gov ? Obviously they fixed the website ; but the broader issue , as Sarah Kliff rightly points out , is that being uninsured is truly terrible . Uninsured Americans really , really wanted coverage , and they werent ready to give up .Kliff doesnt make this point too explicitly , but this diagnosis has another crucial implication : the benefits of Obamacare , for all its imperfections , are immense . Millions of people who lived extremely anxious lives now have far more security than before . Compared with those benefits , the complaints of some already insured people that they have less choice of doctors than before , or that theyre no longer allowed to retain minimalist plans , look like whining . ( And of course not one of the more serious-sounding stories about soaring premiums and all that has held up under scrutiny . )And speaking of whining , the GOP response seems to be to make every possible insinuation to the effect that the numbers are somehow fraudulent . I actually dont think theres a game plan here ; their whole position was premised on the inevitable collapse of health reform , and they have no plan B .All around , as Cohn says , a very good day for reform ."
-1	"The good news about Obamacare so far shouldnt be considered disputable . Enrollments really are above target ; multiple independent surveys show a sharp drop in the uninsured population ; health care cost growth really has slowed dramatically , whatever the reason ; the newly insured are generally satisfied with their coverage . If you want to insist that big problems lie ahead , fine ( but please explain ) , but the facts so far are pretty good .But what Im getting  and what you get whenever you suggest that things are going OK  is an outpouring , not so much of disagreement , as of fury . People get red-in-the-face angry , practically to the point of incoherence , over the suggestion that its not a disaster .Whats that about ? Partly it may be Obama derangement syndrome . I was struck by mail I received after my last column accusing me of shilling for Obama and refusing to admit what a disaster hes been  when the column didnt so much as mention the guy . Obamacare was a label stuck on the Affordable Care Act by its opponents , to tie the president to the disaster to come ; now theyre livid that it , and he , are turning out OK .Partly it may be general hatred for any kind of program that helps the less fortunate , especially if they happen to be , you know , not white . Such programs must be disasters  dont bother me with evidence .And partly , I suspect , theres now an element of shame . If this thing is actually working , everyone who yelled about how it would be a disaster ends up looking fairly stupid .But , you know , sometimes looks dont deceive ."
-1	"Over at Talking Points Memo , they seem bemused by the violent reaction on the right to any suggestion that Obamacare is working as well as all the evidence suggests it is . Josh Marshall and Ezra Klein both made a fairly obvious point : Kathleen Sebeliuss resignation was almost surely timed to follow good news , so that her departure wouldnt be easy to spin as part of a narrative about failed reform . The right , however , went ballistic  not so much expressing skepticism over the good enrollment numbers and the encouraging survey data as expressing total outrage and bewilderment that anyone believes the good news . On the right they know , just know , that its a total disaster .Whats interesting about this is that conservative health wonks , however much they may like to spin facts , know better : even on the right , everyone who knows anything about the subject has been telling people not to expect a collapse , a death spiral , whatever , and even suggesting that Republicans may need to accept that much of Obamacare is irreversible . But not many people in that camp read , say , Avik Roy ; theyre getting their information from Fox News and Rush , and they hear nothing but tales of disaster .But why would they place so much faith in these sources ? These are , after all , the same sources that told them that Romney was going to win big , that we were headed for hyperinflation , and much much more . How can such experiences not have instilled at least a bit of doubt ?Well , we basically know the answer . One thing I learned from reporting on the Madoff affair was the term affinity fraud : people are easily duped by con men who seem to be like them , to be their kind of people . What Fox , Rush etc . do is build a cultural and emotional bond with their audiences , based mainly on who they dislike and attack . And that bond induces those audiences to believe that what comes from these sources is the obvious truth , never mind what those arrogant elitists with their facts and data may be saying . ( Im turning into Stephen Colbert as we speak . )Anyway , its quite a sight to behold ."
-1	"My post yesterday on the new study of post-Romneycare mortality rates in Massachusetts set up a contrast between two policy scenarios : One in which health insurance expansions have a substantial effect on health ( as the Massachusetts mortality data suggests ) , and another in which insurances connection to public health is much more limited ( as the data from the Oregon Medicaid experiment had indicated ) .But theres also a third possibility , which Avik Roy  who knows the Romneycare story as well as anyone on the right  elaborates on here . It may be , he argues , that private insurance does improve outcomes but Medicaid mostly does not , and that the Massachusetts effect is the result of private coverage expanding in that state much faster than in the country as whole . ( There was also a Medicaid expansion under Romneycare , but it accounted for a very modest portion of the newly-insured . )This is a very important issue , obviously  if Roy is right , then even in the light of the Massachusetts data Republican opposition to the Medicaid expansion isnt as deadly as its liberal critics insist  and it will be interesting to see if we end up with Obamacare-era studies that successfully address it . In terms of policy implications , better outcomes for private insurance would tend to make the case for a reform of Obamacare that privatizes low-income coverage and moves Medicaid beneficiaries onto the exchanges ( as Roy and other conservatives have proposed ) , and against the kind of Medicaid-for-most scenario that lies at the end of at least one left-of-center policy path .On the other hand , even if Roy is correct it wouldnt settle the crucial question of how much private coverage people need to purchase to see significant health gains . If most of the mortality improvements were associated with expensive comprehensive coverage , then migrating people from Medicaid to private insurance would only get you better outcomes at a much steeper fiscal price , which neither party ( and yes , especially the G.O.P . ) is particularly eager to pay .Anyway , well see what the future holds , and what the next big study says . ( And so we beat on , boats against the current , borne back ceaselessly into the health care debate  )"
-1	"Gail Collins : David , its less than five weeks until Election Day . And people are so  um  how would you characterize the mood ?David Brooks : Lets see . Giddy with disinterest . Tingling with unconscious ennui . Quivering with apathy . Id say the public mood is paradoxical .Gail : Yet control of the Senate hangs in the balance ! And its all up to the voters in five to 10 states , which neither you nor I inhabit .David : Im really glad to have been spared the agony of swing state envy . Ive never lived in any state that isnt solidly blue . So Ive never known what it feels like to live in a place that has the excitement of competitive races . Hence I dont feel the lack when that excitement goes away . You , coming from Ohio , are not so fortunate . Do you feel pain , perhaps in your wrists and other joints , watching faraway states get all the attention now that you live in a state of political indifference ? Swing state envy is like a concussion , not to be underestimated . I think I may start wearing a purple wrist-band as a sympathy statement .Gail : Our big New York news was that Gov . Andrew Cuomo , whos up for re-election , found it necessary to go to Afghanistan this week . He sort of spun it as an effort to learn more about homeland security . But I honestly think you can do that in the homeland .David : Im presuming this was not a hiking the Appalachian Trail sort of thing . Maybe he went to curry favor with the Pashtun population in Rye . Or for the golfing .Gail : Meanwhile his opponent , whose name recognition is limited to his immediate family , reprised that old Lyndon Johnson Daisy ad where the little girl is picking petals off a flower and then suddenly  countdown to Armageddon ! In this version , when the nuclear bomb goes off , Andrew Cuomos face comes out of the cloud .Did not expect an ad about atomic warfare in the New York gubernatorial race . Possible high point of the political week for me . How about you ? I know youve been taking the occasional gander at the big Senate races . What strikes you as interesting ?David : First the money . Theres been a ton of it , more than $ 228 million by outside groups alone so far . But the surprise in this post-Citizens-United era is that the Democrats are winning the money race so easily . I knew that the Democrats were the party of the rich plutocrats , but I didnt realize how big the lead was . In North Carolina , pro-Democratic groups have a spending lead , $ 13 million to $ 8 million . In Iowa , the Democrats lead $ 9 million to $ 6 million . In Colorado , Democrats lead $ 10 million to $ 5 million . And so on in most states . If this continues Democrats are going to start loving that decision .Gail : I hope it keeps going like this . Id love to watch Mitch McConnell and John Boehner demand that we do something about the poison of super PACs.Meanwhile , on the issues front , Ive been fascinated by how much Republicans have come to love contraception . Really , if they get any more enthusiastic theyre going to start passing out condoms at the debates .David : Or wearing them on their heads like Howie Mandel .Gail : Ive heard several Republican Senate candidates announce that they wanted to see birth control pills sold over the counter . This usually starts with a question about Obamacare  and the requirement that employers cover contraceptives in their health insurance plans . Then the Republican says that if birth control pills were sold like aspirin or Tums , theyd be much cheaper . Which may be true , although having them paid for by your insurance is certainly a better deal .David : Thats clearly true . Im struck , though , by how much the Democrats war-on-women charge against the G.O.P . doesnt seem to be working . In the last Times poll , women were split down the middle , supporting Republicans almost as much as Democrats , 42-43 .Gail : They were still more Democratic-leaning than men . And I do think its working in some races , particularly the ones where the Republican candidate supported the personhood amendment . You know , the one that declares all fertilized eggs have the full rights of a human being .That came up in the Iowa Senate debate , which I am slightly embarrassed to admit I watched from beginning to end .David : Wow . You do have swing state envy . Are you listening to reports on corn prices too ?Gail : Iowa debates are always worthwhile . I enjoy the moment when the fiscal conservative calls for less federal spending , and then is forced to make it clear that underwriting the manufacture of corn-based ethanol does not count as wasteful .David : My problem with the ethanol subsidies is purely selfish . You used to be able to drive around Iowa and see some crop diversity . Now its corn , corn , corn . I bet that even the field of dreams is covered with corn . Its tedious .Gail : Theres been a growing attempt on the part of Republicans to bring ISIS into the campaign . Most of the ads Ive seen dont have a coherent theme . Its like , When terrorists were beheading Americans in Syria , Senator X supported the Obama administration and also missed a public hearing of the Veterans Affairs Committee.David : Im just glad to see any foreign policy in this election . We should have at least some form of national debate on ISIS . I guess this is also a Republican effort to nationalize the election . As observers like Sean Trende have noted , earlier in the campaign there was a disjunction between the fundamentals and the polls . The fundamentals  the presidents low approval ratings  suggest this should be a big Republican year . But the polls were much closer . Many Democratic candidates were hanging in there , even in states Romney carried . Over the past month the polls have moved slightly toward the fundamentals  that is in a slightly Republican direction .Gail : People are so angry at Barack Obama . Their ire seems to be mainly about the economy , yet compared to many other countries , the United States is doing pretty well economically . Im happy to accept the theory that people are angry because of income inequality and the struggling middle class . But the solution to that wouldnt be electing a Congress thats determined to cut federal spending . Youd just wind up with more laid-off state employees , highway construction workers , even schoolteachers .Want to explain that to me ?David : Its possible that people dont think theyre getting their moneys worth . It could be theyre not crazy about boondoggles like ethanol or gubernatorial trips to Afghanistan . Its possible that they think they could spend money more wisely than Congress does . Cant imagine how they could leap to that conclusion .Gail : Well , thats Congress . But theyre trying to make it all about the president . Im expecting that Georgia voters will soon be seeing ads in which Michelle Nunns picture morphs into Barack Obama .David : What strikes me about this is that the movement is similar across many races , suggesting that there is a national dynamic in place . That makes sense . Over the past five midterms weve pretty much seen national dynamics in place most of the time . There was a wave for one party or another . This year that should favor Republicans , who are trying to build the election around national issues , not local candidates .Gail : Do you think these elections matter ? Theres a lot of sentiment that they dont  that if the Republicans take over the Senate , therell be the same stalemate weve got now . That it might even make it easier for the Democrats in 2016 , because therell still be gridlock and the Republicans will be more clearly to blame .David : Im simple-minded . I think winning is better than losing . Remember , once an incumbent gets in , he or she is likely to stay there for a long time . I dont think Democrats should be pre-rationalizing this years results .Gail : Me neither . Although it would be pretty interesting if the Republicans won control of the Senate , and we got to spend two years watching them complain about the evils of the filibuster .David : I cant imagine much legislation will be passed either way . After Obamacare , which was signed into law in March of 2010 , I cant think of a major piece of legislation that has passed in any of the last four years , and I suppose well go another two in the same stagnation .Gail : You must be forgetting the Responsible Helium Administration and Stewardship Act .But about these elections  I admit that I am jealous of the big swing states . If I was in Iowa or Alaska or North Carolina , Id be obsessed with the senate race . Id talk about it all the time , and people would run away when they saw me coming .David : Youve got it bad .Gail : Here in New York , everythings pretty much preordained . Except in Staten Island , where the Republican congressman who threatened to throw a TV reporter over a Capitol balcony might be in trouble .David : Is that because TV reporters are so light ? Throwing a print reporter would be way more impressive .Gail : Well , he failed to follow through . Maybe his constituents are irked that he was all show and no throw . But hes also under multiple indictments for perjury and tax evasion . And yet his defeat is not a foregone conclusion .David : Id think a perjury record would be a plus . Practice makes perfect ."
-1	"Jonathan Cohn looks at the evidence so far on health insurance premiums , and finds things not too bad:Coverage will get more expensive for the majority of consumers , as it almost always does . Changes in premiums will vary enormously , from state to state and from plan to plan . But , overall , the 2015 premiums increases will not be significantly worse than they were in the past . They might even be a little better .Charles Gaba finds much the same . Furthermore , theres a clear trend within the trend : states that did their best to make Obamacare work are also delivering good deals to their residents . California is heading for an increase of only 4.2 percent . On the other hand , things are not looking too good in Florida:In Florida , by contrast , the Republicans in charge did very little to promote the law and , at times , seemed determined to undermine it . Never was this more clear than in 2013 , when the legislature passed and Governor Rick Scott signed a bill that suspended state governments ability to reject excessive premium increases .Overall , yet more evidence that this reform works wherever politicians let it work ."
-1	"Three somehow related stories of the day:1 . Brent Bozells Media Research Center is an important part of the machinery that has , for the most part , successfully intimidated the news media into adopting a right-wing slant . ( Ive faced mass mailings , concerted attacks on my university email , and so on . ) But Jim Romenesko finds something interesting : Bozell doesnt write his own columns or books , forcing a staffer to do it .2 . The Koch brothers have been running ads in Louisiana with distressed citizens facing ruination from Obamacare . But the people in the ads are all paid actors .3 . Best of all is the news from The Can Kicks Back , which is a Bowles-Simpson-run outfit that was supposed to be the youth arm of Fix the Debt . It has always been an astroturf operation , and a clumsy one at that , doing things like hiring dancers to stage fake flash mobs and placing identical ghostwritten articles in college newspapers . Now , The Can Kicks Backs campaign against debt is running into trouble , because its , um , running out of money .What these stories have in common is that they show how much of what passes for genuine expression of public concern is really just a bought and paid-for ( or , in the case of The Can , not sufficiently paid-for ) front for plutocratic priorities ."
-1	"The Commonwealth Fund is out with a new report comparing advanced-country health care systems , and the ( mostly pre-Obamacare ) US system looks very bad indeed : vastly higher spending per capita than anyone else , with worse results .Of course , this is nothing new . And as always pointing out the obvious brings out claims that the US system is somehow superior despite its lousy outcomes . Aaron Carroll helpfully reminds us that all of the arguments surfacing here are zombies  arguments that should have died in the face of clear evidence that theyre wrong , but keep on shambling along nonetheless . ( I actually learned the term zombie idea from the health care discussion , specifically the unending attempts to trash the Canadian system . )I think its important , however , to be explicit about something Carroll obviously knows but doesnt emphasize : the reason for the prevalence of zombies in this field . Some of it is chauvinism . But the main reason for the zombies is unwillingness to accept facts that conflict with ideology . The American health care system is by far the most privatized , most market-oriented system in the advanced world ; its also far and away the most expensive , without any sign of getting anything for all that money .If you are committed to the view that the magic of the market solves all problems , this is disturbing  so it must not be true .

-1	"One of the truly amazing ( and disheartening ) things about the Great Recession and its aftermath has been the continuing insistence of many economists that its somehow a supply-side slump , driven by the evils of Obamacare or something . This tends to come from people who view stagflation in the 1970s as having permanently refuted all things Keynes .So I guess its worth pointing out repeatedly that the recent slump shows all the hallmarks of a demand-side shock ; in particular , rising unemployment has been associated with falling inflation  the opposite of stagflation . Heres an international comparison I happen to have produced for other purposes , comparing the change in unemployment from 2007 to 2013 with the change in inflation over the same period:An interesting point : if you fit a linear equation to these points , the slope of the implied Phillips curve is -0.16  which is the same number the influential recent paper by Kiley ( pdf ) finds using combined time series and cross-section on US metropolitan areas . Just a coincidence , probably , but I had expected the international relationship to look weaker ."

-1	"Noah Smith writes that one should not be rude about people you disagree with , because they might turn out to be right . Indeed ; what possible purpose can be served by , say , referring to Austrian economics as a brain worm ? Oh , wait .Actually , I think that Noah was doing the right thing when he brought in the brain worms , and is off on the wrong track on the civility thing . So let me make the case for brain worms .First , picturesque language , used right , serves an important purpose . Words ought to be a little wild ,  wrote John Maynard Keynes , for they are the assaults of thoughts on the unthinking. You could say , Im dubious about the case for expansionary austerity , which rests on questionable empirical evidence and zzzzzzzz ; or you could accuse austerians of believing in the Confidence Fairy . Which do you think is more effective at challenging a really bad economic doctrine ?Beyond that , civility is a gesture of respect  and sure enough , the loudest demands for civility come from those who have done nothing to earn that respect . Noah felt ( and was ) justified in ridiculing the Austrians because they dont argue in good faith ; faced with a devastating failure of their prediction about inflation , they didnt concede that they were wrong and try to explain why . Instead , they denied reality or tried to redefine the meaning of inflation .And if you look at the uncivil remarks by people like , well , me , youll find that they are similarly aimed at people arguing in bad faith . I talk now and then about zombie and cockroach ideas . Zombies are ideas that should have been killed by evidence , but keep shambling along  e.g . the claim that all of Europes troubled debtors were fiscally irresponsible before the crisis ; cockroaches are ideas that you thought wed gotten rid of , but keep on coming back , like the claim that Keynes would never have called for fiscal stimulus in the face of current debt levels ( Britain in the 1930s had much higher debt to GDP than it does now ) . Well , what Im doing is going after bad-faith economics  economics that keeps trotting out claims that have already been discredited .Nor are zombies and cockroaches the only kinds of bad faith ; the worst , as far as Im concerned , involves refusing to take responsibility for your actual statements . The failure of high inflation to materialize doesnt mean that I was wrong , because I only said that there was a risk of inflation . When I said that Obamacare spending adds a trillion dollars to the deficit , I wasnt misleading readers , because I didnt actually deny that the ACA as a whole reduces the deficit. And of course , people who engage in that kind of bad faith screech loudly about civility when theyre caught at it .When theres an honest , good-faith economic debate  say , the ongoing controversy about the effects of quantitative easing  by all means lets be civil . But in my experience demands for civility almost always come from people who have forfeited the right to the respect they demand ."
-1	"Ezra Kleins new venture Vox is up , and so far , so OK  some fairly interesting pieces , and nothing like Nate Silvers lamentable decision to make a professional concern troll his chief writer on climate . I am troubled by Ezras big inauguratory think piece , but thats because I think the piece raises a genuine intellectual puzzle .What Ezra does is cite research showing that people understand the world in ways that suit their tribal identities : in controlled experiments both conservatives and liberals systematically misread facts in a way that confirms their biases . And more information doesnt help : people screen out or discount facts that dont fit their worldview . Politics , as he says , makes us stupid .But heres the thing : the lived experience is that this effect is not , in fact , symmetric between liberals and conservatives . Yes , liberals are sometimes subject to bouts of wishful thinking . But can anyone point to a liberal equivalent of conservative denial of climate change , or the unskewing mania late in the 2012 campaign , or the frantic efforts to deny that Obamacare is in fact covering a lot of previously uninsured Americans ? I dont mean liberals taking positions you personally disagree with  I mean examples of overwhelming rejection of something that shouldnt even be in dispute .Or look at how liberals reacted to the woes of healthcare.gov . We heard a lot of talk about how it was Obamas Katrina , or his Iraq . But was there anything like Bushs heckuva job moment  which was matched by widespread insistence on the right that he was actually doing a great job ? Was there anything like the years-long denial that anything was going wrong with the Iraq occupation ? On the contrary , liberals were quick to acknowledge that the rollout was a disaster , and in fact sort of freaked out  which , as Noam Scheiber says , is what they usually do in the face of setbacks . And whats more , as Scheiber says , thats a good thing : faced with setbacks , liberals rush to fix things , rather than denying the problem . Hence the stunning Obamacare comeback .At this point I could castigate Ezra for his both-sides-do-it article  but instead , let me pose this as a question : why are the two sides so asymmetric ? People want to believe what suits their preconceptions , so why the big difference between left and right on the extent to which this desire trumps facts ?One possible answer would be that liberals and conservatives are very different kinds of people  that liberalism goes along with a skeptical , doubting  even self-doubting  frame of mind ; a liberal is someone who wont take his own side in an argument.Another possible answer is that its institutional , that liberals dont have the same kind of monolithic , oligarch-financed network of media organizations and think tanks as the right .Whatever it is , I think its important : people are people , but politics doesnt seem to have the same stupiditizing effect on left and right ."
-1	"The facts have a well-known liberal bias ,  declared Rob Corddry way back in 2004  and experience keeps vindicating his joke . But why ?Not long ago Ezra Klein cited research showing that both liberals and conservatives are subject to strong tribal bias  presented with evidence , they see what they want to see . I then wrote that this poses a puzzle , because in practice liberals dont engage in the kind of mass rejections of evidence that conservatives do . The inevitable response was a torrent of angry responses and claims that liberals do too reject facts  but none of the claims measured up .Just to be clear : Yes , you can find examples where *some* liberals got off on a hobbyhorse of one kind or another , or where the liberal conventional wisdom turned out wrong . But you dont see the kind of lockstep rejection of evidence that we see over and over again on the right . Where is the liberal equivalent of the near-uniform conservative rejection of climate science , or the refusal to admit that Obamacare is in fact reaching a lot of previously uninsured Americans ?What I tried to suggest , but maybe didnt say clearly , is that the most likely answer lies not so much in the character of individual liberals versus that of individual conservatives , as in the difference between the two sides goals and institutions . And Jonathan Chaits recent thoughts on the inherently partisan nature of data-based journalism are , I think , helpful in bringing this better into focus .As Chait says , the big Obamacare comeback and the reaction of the right are a very good illustration of the forces at work .The basic facts here are that after a very slow start due to the healthcare.gov debacle , almost everything has gone right for reform . A huge surge of enrollments more than made up the initially lost ground ; the age mix of enrollees has improved ; multiple independent surveys have found a substantial drop in the number of Americans without health insurance .Opponents of Obamacare could respond to these facts by arguing that the whole thing is nonetheless a bad idea , or they could accept that the rollout has gone OK but call for major changes in the program looking forward . What theyre actually engaged in , however , is mass denial and conspiracy theorizing strongly reminiscent of their reaction to polls showing Mitt Romney on the way to defeat , or for that matter evidence of climate change . Acceptance of the facts is , well , unacceptable .Nothing illustrated this better than the reaction to Ezra Kleins own note about the resignation of Kathleen Sebelius , which was intended as analysis rather than advocacy ; Klein simply made the fairly obvious point that the HHS secretary was in effect free to resign now because Obamacare has been turned around and is going well . But Kleins statement was met with a mix of outrage and ridicule on the right ; how dare he suggest that the program was succeeding ?Why is it , then , that the right treats statements of fact as proof of liberal bias ?Chaits answer , which I agree is part of the story , is that the liberal and conservative movements are not at all symmetric in their goals . Conservatives want smaller government as an end in itself ; liberals dont seek bigger government per se  they want government to achieve certain things , which is quite different . Youll never see liberals boasting about raising the share of government spending in GDP the way conservatives talk proudly about bringing that share down . Because liberals want government to accomplish something , they want to know whether government programs are actually working ; because conservatives dont want the government doing anything except defense and law enforcement , they arent really interested in evidence about success or failure . True , they may seize on alleged evidence of failure to reinforce their case , but its about political strategy , not genuine interest in the facts .One side consequence of this great divide , by the way , is the way conservatives project their own style onto their opponents  insisting that climate researchers are just trying to rationalize government intervention , that liberals like trains because they destroy individualism .But this cant be the whole story . It doesnt explain , for example , the rejection of polls in 2012 , or the refusal of the right to admit that things werent going well in Iraq  both cases in which conservatives really did have an interest in the outcomes . So what else differentiates the two sides ?Well , surely another factor is the lack of a comprehensive liberal media environment comparable to the closed conservative universe . If you lean right , you can swaddle yourself 24/7 in Fox News and talk radio , never hearing anything that disturbs your preconceptions . ( If you were getting your news from Fox , you were told that the hugely encouraging Rand survey was nothing but bad news for Obamacare . ) If you lean left , you might watch MSNBC , but the allegedly liberal network at least tries to make a distinction between news and opinion  and if you watch in the morning , what you get is right-wing conspiracy theorizing more or less indistinguishable from Fox .Yet another factor may be the different incentives of opinion leaders , which in turn go back to the huge difference in resources . Strange to say , there are more conservative than liberal billionaires , and it shows in think-tank funding . As a result , I like to say that there are three kinds of economists : Liberal professional economists , conservative professional economists , and professional conservative economists . The other box isnt entirely empty , but there just isnt enough money on the left to close the hack gap .Finally , I do believe that there is a difference in temperament between the sides . I know that it doesnt show up in the experiments done so far , which show liberals and conservatives more or less equally inclined to misread facts in a tribal way . But such experiments may not be enough like real life to capture the true differences  although Id be the first to admit that I dont have solid evidence for that claim . I am , after all , a liberal ."
-1	"They call me a long shot ,  Estakio Beltran , a congressional candidate in Washington state , declares in a TV ad , never once disclosing that hes a Democrat but taking aim with his shotgun at a piata  an elephant piata in case anyone doubts what hes gunning for . Bam ! the gun goes off and the sad-eyed , paper-tattered toy elephant topples . Mr. Beltrans ad is one of many bamming and kerpowing across the land from candidates pandering to gun enthusiasts . He may not win an election , but his seems the most entertaining or at least the silliest . Particularly so when he racks the empty shell from his gun in macho triumph and rides off like Clint Eastwood , heading east toward the Capitol on a loping donkey ( a Democratic donkey ? ) .Gun ads come and go as political staccato punctuating the electioneering season . They play out as an entirely separate reality from such familiar Americana as the accidental Uzi death last week at the hands of a nine-year-old in Arizona . The latest ads were collected by National Public Radio and , unsurprisingly , shooting a thick wad of Obamacare legislation is the clich of choice among Republicans bearing arms . Will Brooke , a Republican congressional candidate in Alabama , has a little fun ,  showing off his considerable arsenal of favored weapons  everything from gleaming pistol to ominous assault rifle  and shooting them all at what the Supreme Court has pronounced the law of the land . Joni Ernst , a leather-clad Republican running for Senate from Iowa , dismounts her motorcycle and gets off six rounds and a promise to unload on the Affordable Care Act . Give me a shot !  she implores voters in her sign-off .So it goes , to the point where Republicans choosing other sorts of targets provide merciful relief . Matt Rosendale , a Montana candidate for the House , blasts up and away at what he would have you believe is a federal drone snooping on his sacred freedoms . Dan Sullivan , an Alaska Republican running for the Senate , drills a defenseless old TV set , standing his ground against out-of-staters flooding the airwaves with mudslinging campaign ads .So far , no one is making a commercial about the new Idaho law that allows teachers and students to bring guns to class . A professor exercising his enhanced concealed carry rights at the state university in Pocatello accidentally shot himself in the foot Wednesday .But in truth , there are moments of substance in the politics of the gun . The ballot in Washington state has competing gun initiatives this fall , with rival check writers going at it to finance TV commercials . Initiative 594 aims to close the notorious loophole that lets people buy guns without background checks online and at gun shows . Backing it are such major donors as Bill and Melinda Gates and Nick Hanauer , the Seattle venture capitalist . In contrast , initiative 591 would prevent the expansion of background checks . The gun lobby stands behind this as the ballot duel plays out ."
-1	"WOODSTOCK , Ga.  THERES a political axiom that says if nobody is upset with what youre doing , youre not doing your job . Weve seen this proved time and again in the liberal attacks on conservatives like Sarah Palin and Dr. Benjamin Carson , who provide principled examples to women and minorities and are savaged by the left for doing that job so well .But cheap-shot politics isnt relegated to Democrats . Last week the House speaker , John A. Boehner of Ohio , attacked conservative groups who criticized the budget deal , hashed out by Representative Paul D. Ryan , Republican of Wisconsin , and Senator Patty Murray , Democrat of Washington , for failing to reduce spending and for raising taxes .Theyre using our members and theyre using the American people for their own goals ,  he said , calling the opposition ridiculous.In one way , Mr. Boehner is correct . The goals of groups like ours are those that congressional Republicans once espoused : smaller government , less spending and lower taxes . Alas , those who demand such things today from their elected officials face unfounded attacks .Make no mistake : The deal is a betrayal of the conservatives who fueled the Republicans 2010 midterm shellacking of Democrats .It raises discretionary spending above $ 1 trillion for 2014 and 2015 . It reneges on $ 63 billion of sequester cuts . Its $ 28 billion in deficit reduction over the next decade is a pittance compared with the $ 680 billion deficit piled up in 2013 alone . And it raises taxes , particularly on airplane passengers through new travel fees .Perhaps most troubling is that the deal locks in spending for President Obamas Affordable Care Act , ensuring that the worst parts of Obamacare will continue unfolding to the shock of increasing numbers of Americans .But the budget plan is about more than taxes and spending . It was a slick means by which Senate Republicans could appear to oppose the deal while in fact allowing it to sail through the chamber .Take Senator Mitch McConnell , Republican of Kentucky , the minority leader , who opposed efforts to defund Obamacare earlier this year while claiming to do everything possible to stop it .After attacking conservative groups for their efforts to prevent the funding of Obamacare , Mr. McConnell , who is facing a primary challenge in his 2014 re-election race , is now seeking to portray himself as a conservative darling , championing fiscal austerity by voicing opposition to the budget proposal . ( My organization has not endorsed a candidate in that race . ) Doing so gives him some nifty talking points that align with most conservative groups , but it is little more than parliamentary sleight of hand .Consider how he handled the vote on the bill . To defeat a filibuster , its supporters needed 60 senators to win cloture and move to a final vote . Instead of rallying his troops against the vote , Mr. McConnell allowed a handful of Republicans in battleground states  who needed to be seen as supporting the bill  to vote for cloture , while he and the rest railed against it , casting themselves in the role of budget hawks .With cloture accomplished , a dozen Republicans were then free to vote against final passage if they need wiggle room when theyre confronted on the campaign trail next fall by voters demanding action on government spending . Mr. McConnell and many Senate Republicans used the vote to manipulate the system , allowing them to cast themselves as deal makers or principled conservatives , depending on their audience .This is not principled policy making ; what were seeing is simple gamesmanship that raises legitimate questions about which values Republicans truly hold and which are merely interchangeable with those of Democrats .The job of Tea Party groups and other conservatives is pretty simple : to inform Americans about the need for restraint in spending , tax relief , pro-growth economic policies and individual liberty  and to support the men and women who pledge to promote these positions . To the extent that the speaker of the House and Senate Republicans are attacking such groups , it looks as if were doing our job .But after this budget vote , our job expands to include informing Americans about who keeps their word in Congress and who does not .When establishment Republicans call spending increases spending cuts , deny that raising taxes is a hike , and champion deficit reduction that doesnt scratch the surface of our nations debt , it suggests a detachment from the facts . But when those who voted for them criticize their elected officials for not keeping their promises , and are then attacked for doing so , it suggests that Kurt Vonnegut was right in observing , A sane person to an insane society must appear insane."
-1	"IN just over a decade the United States will need 130,000 more doctors than medical schools are producing . So says the Association of American Medical Colleges , which warns of a doctor shortage that will drive up wait times , shorten office visits and make it harder for Americans to access the care they need .The road to Obamacare has seen its share of speed bumps , as well as big potholes . But a physician shortage is unlikely to be one of its roadblocks .Shortage forecasters point to two major factors . One is an aging population . The proportion of Americans who are 65 and older will increase to 19 percent in 2030 from 12.9 percent today , according to federal projections . Second , Obamacare will insure 30 million more Americans by the end of the decade , dramatically increasing demand for physicians . Extrapolating forward from todays 2.4 physicians per 1,000 Americans would mean we will need at least 90,000 more physicians by 2020 , or so the reasoning goes .Regardless of your political views , there are good reasons to be skeptical of these predictions . Take Massachusetts , where Obamacare-style reforms were implemented beginning in 2006 , adding nearly 400,000 people to the insurance rolls . Appointment wait times for family physicians , internists , pediatricians , obstetricians and gynecologists , and even specialists like cardiologists , have bounced around since but have not appreciably increased overall , according to a Massachusetts Medical Society survey . Massachusettss experience may differ from other areas , particularly rural regions , but the results of reform there suggest shortage fears are exaggerated .The population is indeed aging fast , but the methods of treating illness in old age are also changing quickly . Today , more patients can be cared for in subacute settings rather than in hospitals . And new technologies are turning the treatment of many medical conditions into less resource-intensive endeavors , requiring fewer doctors to manage each episode of illness .Innovations , such as sensors that enable remote monitoring of disease and more timely interventions , can help pre-empt the need for inpatient treatment . Drugs and devices can also obviate the need for more costly treatments . Minimally invasive procedures , like laparoscopic surgeries , can be done more quickly with faster recovery times and fewer physicians . An average patient stay in the hospital is about two days or less following a stent but about seven days following a coronary bypass operation . Research on radiation treatments for breast cancer suggests that 15 treatments can be just as effective as the traditional 30 treatments . Likewise , one larger dose of radiation can be as good at relieving pain from bone metastases as five to 10 separate , smaller treatments . Theres every reason to expect the pace of these timesaving medical innovations to continue .Other medical personnel can also expand the reach of physicians to care for a larger population . Nurse practitioners , health aides , pharmacists , dietitians , psychologists and others already care for patients in numerous ways , and their roles should expand in the future . The rise of nonphysician providers will enable more team care . Skilled health aides will monitor patients at home and alert a doctor if certain medical parameters decline . Nurses will provide wound care to diabetic patients , adjust medications like blood thinners and provide the initial management of chemotherapy side effects for cancer patients . Pharmacists will provide more counseling and urgent care . Physicians will remain essential to the proper diagnosis and treatment of disease , but will be backed up by teams who will help manage the more routine features of chronic illness .The opportunity exists to deliver more services and care with fewer physicians , but its not a foregone conclusion . Policy changes will be necessary to reach the full potential of team care .That means expanding the scope of practice laws for nurse practitioners and pharmacists to allow them to provide comprehensive primary care ; changing laws inhibiting telemedicine across state lines ; and reforming medical malpractice laws that force providers to stick with inefficient practices simply to reduce liability risk . New payment models must reward investments in technologies that can save money in the long run . Most important , we need to change medical school curriculum to provide training in team care to take full advantage of the capabilities of nonphysicians in caring for patients .Instead of building more medical schools and expanding our doctor pool , we should focus on increasing the productivity of existing physicians and other health care workers while incorporating new technologies and practices that make care more efficient . With doctors , as with drugs or surgery , more is not always better ."
-1	"Like so many other parts of health care , childbirth has become a more medically intense experience over the last two decades . The use of drugs to induce labor has become far more common , as have cesarean sections . Today , about half of all births in this country are hastened either by drugs or surgery , double the share in 1990 .Crucial to the change has been a widely held belief that once fetuses pass a certain set of thresholds  often 39 weeks of gestation and five and a half pounds in weight  theyre as healthy as they can get . More time in the womb doesnt do them much good , according to this thinking . For parents and doctors , meanwhile , scheduling a birth , rather than waiting for its random arrival , is clearly more convenient .But a huge new set of data , based on every child born in Florida over an 11-year span , is calling into question some of the most basic assumptions of our medicalized approach to childbirth . The results also play into a larger issue : the growing sense among many doctors and other experts that Americans would actually be healthier if our health care system were sometimes less aggressive .The new data suggest that the thresholds to maximize a childs health seem to be higher , which means that many fetuses might benefit by staying longer in the womb , where they typically add at least a quarter-pound per week . Seven-pound babies appear to be healthier than six-pound babies  and to fare better in school as they age . The same goes for eight-pound babies compared with seven-pound babies , and nine-pound babies compared with eight-pound babies . Weight , of course , may partly be an indicator of broader fetal health , but it seems to be a meaningful one : The chunkier the baby , the better it does on average , all the way up to almost 10 pounds .Birth weight matters , and it matters for everyone ,  says David N. Figlio , a Northwestern University professor and co-author of the study , which will soon be published in the American Economic Review , one of the fields top journals .Mr. Figlio  5 pounds , 15 ounces at birth  is quick to add that birth weight is not destiny . Its effects are considerably smaller than those of social class , for example . A lighter baby of well-educated parents is likely to do much better in life than a heavier baby of high-school dropouts .Yet within every group the researchers studied , birth weight appeared to have a noticeable effect , even after controlling for a long list of other factors . Mr. Figlio estimates that , all else equal , a 10-pound baby will score an average of 80 points higher on the 1,600-point SAT than a six-pound baby . Another way to see the pattern is to look only at top-scoring students : Among the top 5 percent of test scorers in elementary school , one in three weighed at least eight pounds at birth , compared with only one in four of all babies .The Florida study will not be the last word on birth weight and timing . As the authors acknowledge , they can not rule out the possibility that weight is a proxy for other aspects of fetal health that more time in the womb would not improve . And late and heavy babies also bring some risks . Still , the results are sufficiently striking  across a very large population , and present in every subgroup  that theyre likely to influence the debate about the medicalization of birth .In 2011 , the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and other groups began pushing to eliminate induced labor before the 39th week of pregnancy absent a clear medical reason . The induction rate has since fallen . If further research confirms the Florida findings , it will be easy to see an argument for further declines , as well as for a serious look at whether the induction rate is also too high in the 40th week . Many inductions today are elective , rather than coming after a womans water has broken or after a medical problem .The notion that fetuses may benefit from being in the womb beyond the 39th week , says Dr. Brent C. James , who runs the Institute for Health Care Delivery Research in Salt Lake City , makes perfect clinical sense. As in much of biology , he added , You dont have a hard cutoff , a cliff edge.These issues are part of a debate that extends well beyond childbirth . The notion that Mother Nature should more often trump Pitocin and other induction drugs fits with a broad questioning of the American health care system , famously the worlds most intensive and expensive . Starting about a decade ago , an inchoate group of reformers  doctors , nurses , hospital executives , social scientists and others  began pushing the idea that there was a better way . Yes , intensive medicine can bring lifesaving benefits , but technologically advanced treatments often dont work any better than more basic forms .In particular , treatments that work wonders on a small group of patients often spread to a much wider group of people , including many who dont benefit from them . Induced labor , which does indeed help women and babies facing health risks , is one example . Others include cardiac stents , back surgery and prostate treatment .Armed with reams of evidence , the reformers began pushing hospitals and insurers , including Medicare , to change . In the private market , among other things , insurers have excluded some high-cost doctors from their networks . For all the problems and waste that still exist , the effort has had an effect : Health costs have slowed sharply in the last several years , surprising nearly every expert . Remarkably , per-person spending in Medicare is on a pace to be about 6 percent lower this year than it was three years ago .Its impossible to know whether the trend will last . But Obamacare , while not the main reason for the slowdown , may be sustaining it . Even as the law has added people to the health-insurance rolls , which increases costs , it has also targeted unnecessary , expensive care .Whether the slowdown will continue is among todays biggest economic questions . Yet the economic implications arent even the most important ones . The health implications are . The idea that we can be healthier with less health care is no longer just wishful thinking ; its a serious theory , with growing evidence .Childbirth makes for a crucial case study . It affects everyone , and for centuries was among the biggest dangers women confronted . The maternal death rate per childbirth long approached 1.5 percent , historians estimate .So the notion that modern medicine should be removed from childbirth altogether is clearly wrong . In the United States today , the death rate for mothers in childbirth is less than 0.02 percent . Modern medicine saves the lives of millions of childbearing women  and their infants  every year .Yet as with stents , back surgery and prostate treatments , many believe the medicalization of childbirth almost certainly went too far . Too much intervention is not a good thing ,  said Dr. Barbara S. Levy , vice president for health policy at the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists . Researchers now agree that nonmedical inductions before 39 weeks are a problem . The next question is whether fetuses continue to get substantial benefits from being in the womb  without much additional risk , for mother or baby  after 39 weeks .Its a question that affects a lot of births . In 2012 , 30 percent of births came between 39 and 40 weeks , 20 percent came between 40 and 41 weeks and 14 percent came after 41 weeks .Florida offers a window on the issue because the state tracks children from birth through college . ( Historically , most databases that follow individuals over time have been small . ) The authors of the new study  Mr. Figlio ; Jonathan Guryan and Krzysztof Karbownik , also of Northwestern ; and Jeffrey Roth , of the University of Florida College of Medicine  used the data to compare birth weight with test scores from third through eighth grades , as well as with kindergarten readiness scores . They controlled for , among other factors , the health and sex of the baby , the length of the pregnancy and the health , age , race and education of the mother .To test their results , the researchers also looked at twins . Twins are a frequent subject of research , because they share many unobservable environmental conditions . And the effect of birth weight on twins was similar to its effect on single babies . Importantly , the effect was also very similar for same-sex twins ( who can be identical twins , with the same genes ) and different-sex twins ( who can not be identical ) . That similarity suggests that birth weight was not merely a proxy for hidden genetic factors  or hidden fetal conditions  that would remain unaffected by an extra pound or two .The relationship between birth weight and test scores was present by the time children enrolled in kindergarten and remained fairly constant throughout elementary and middle school . Other research has found that children who do better in elementary school are more likely to graduate from college , earn more as adults and live longer .This pattern would fit with the so-called Barker hypothesis . It is the once controversial theory proposed by the late British epidemiologist Dr. David Barker  now largely accepted  that conditions in the womb and infancy cast a lifelong shadow . Many forms of cancer and heart disease , among other conditions , have roots in the earliest stages of life , Dr. Barker argued .The authors of the new paper are continuing to study Florida children and say other researchers should try to confirm or cast doubt on the findings . Without more research , many doctors may be skeptical of changing their habits . Dr. Wendy M. White of the Mayo Clinic said that she would want to make sure that often unobserved health problems , including those unconnected to genes or fetal conditions , werent causing both lower birth weights and cognitive gaps .Whatever the uncertainty , the prevalence of the effects across so many groups , in one of the nations largest , most diverse states , offers reason to take the results seriously . Some of the implications seem straightforward . Other studies , for example , have found that anti-poverty programs , like food stamps , can increase the weight of babies born to poor mothers . By extension , those programs , which are often derided as wasteful , may have very large health , education and economic benefits .The issue of how to time births is thornier . If the results hold up , we are probably inducing too many babies too soon . On the other hand , there are some risks for babies , and pain for mothers , with longer pregnancies , especially beyond 41 weeks . There are two patients here , and you want to optimize the outcome for both ,  as Dr. Levy says . It is conceivable that fewer inductions could bring better overall results while also making some rare newborn complications slightly more common .The trade-offs are sometimes unavoidable . But acknowledging and grappling with those trade-offs would still represent a significant shift . For a long time , we have fooled ourselves into thinking that more health care meant better health . The truth may actually be more reassuring ."
-1	"OK , were obviously in for a lot of breathless hype about the new conservatism , as supposedly exemplified by Room to Grow , which self-consciously lays out what are supposed to be bold new conservative policy ideas . One thing you dont find amid the hype , however , is much actual description of the new ideas in question . Thats because the ideas dont bear too much scrutiny .The truth is that conservatives have a big intellectual problem . Thirty-five years ago they really did have something new to say  basically , the claim that tax cuts and deregulation would produce widely shared economic gains , a rising tide that would lift all boats , etc.. That hasnt happened , of course , although the Paul Ryans will never admit it and just keep pushing for more of the same . The new conservatives are at least aware that things havent quite worked out as promised  but theyre not willing to challenge fundamental assumptions . So what they write conveys a kind of desperate feeling  theyre trying to tweak the paradigm at the edges , but without straying over the invisible border that would make them basically modern liberals .If you look at the health care chapter , for example , it does two main things . First , it tries to trash Obamacare with borderline dishonest claims  it will leave 31 million American uninsured ! It will cost $ 2 trillion ! If you look at the CBO estimates ( pdf ) these claims are based on , you learn that about a third of those remaining uninsured are unauthorized immigrants the law was never intended to reach , a significant number will be uninsured because Republican-controlled states are refusing to expand Medicaid , and the rest will be uninsured because for whatever reason they choose not to sign up . Oh , and its $ 1.8 trillion , fully offset by cost savings and additional revenue .And the conservative alternative is the Coburn plan , which claims to cover as many people as Obamacare much more cheaply . But aside from doubts about the analysis  and would you really want to describe Douglas Holtz-Eakins operation as nonpartisan ?  as far as we can tell the low cost comes from the fact that many of those who would be supposedly insured would have policies offering very little protection . The point is that the whole thing feels a lot like supply-side snake oil , promising something for nothing .The chapter on tax reform does break some new ground , but some ground shouldnt be broken . It suggests that the big problem with the welfare state is that people no longer count on their children to support them when theyre old , so birth rates drop  because nothing makes children feel loved and valued like knowing that their parents viewed them as organic 401 ( k ) s. And the answer is tax credits  nonrefundable , of course , so only worthwhile to people with enough income .Theres more . But really , this is all about conservatives trying to deal with the fact that their policy agenda has left ordinary families behind without challenging the mindset and prejudices behind that agenda . As you might guess , the results arent impressive ."

We can presume , then , that people like John Boehner  who declared that it would never work and that more people would lose insurance than gain it  are spending some time now trying to understand how they could have been so wrong .April fools ! ( Yes , I know its July . )I guess theres always been a human tendency to claim that you were right even when you have been totally wrong . George Orwell put it clearly in In Front of Your Nose:The point is that we are all capable of believing things which we know to be untrue , and then , when we are finally proved wrong , impudently twisting the facts so as to show that we were right . Intellectually , it is possible to carry on this process for an indefinite time : the only check on it is that sooner or later a false belief bumps up against solid reality , usually on a battlefield .Actually , if you look at the complete unrepentance of the Cheneys et al , even bumping up against reality on a battlefield seems not to be enough these days . And it does seem to me that denial runs even deeper than it used to ; consider the impossible-to-be-more-wrong Rick Santelli angrily declaring that he was right .Its probably about partisanship , which means both living in an information bubble and being so deeply committed to a worldview that you literally cant consider facts that dont fit .But its quite something to behold ."

As usual , Noah is very mild and eager to give the benefit of the doubt , although even so theres not much there .What Id like to point out , however , is that theres an overarching reason not to take any of this stuff seriously . All the anti-Keynesian stories ( except uncertainty , which as Nick Rowe points out is actually a Keynesian story but doesnt know it ) are supply-side stories ; Cochrane even puts scare quotes around the word demand . Basically , theyre claiming that unemployment benefits , or Obamacare , or regulations , or something , are reducing the willingness of workers and firms to produce stuff .How would you test this ? In a supply-constrained economy , the kind of monetary policy weve had , with the Fed quintupling the size of its balance sheet over a short period of time , would be highly inflationary . Indeed , just about everyone on the right has been predicting runaway inflation year after year .Meanwhile , if you had a demand-side view , and considered the implications of the zero lower bound , you declared that nothing of the sort would happen:Now , the equation [ the quantity equation for money ] still holds . But all that tells us is that any changes in the money supply are offset one for one by changes in velocity Actually , in the real world its even worse , because central banks dont control the money supply , they only control the monetary base . Broad aggregates like M2 may well be unaffected by what the central bank does : increase the monetary base , and all that happens is an offsetting fall in the money multiplier .( I was arguing against neomonetarism , but the point holds more generally . )Reality:It seems to me that the failure of the inflation predicted by anti-Keynesians to appear  and the fact that this failure was predicted by Keynesian models  is a further big reason not to take what these people are saying seriously ."
-1	"Alert ( or at least health-care-obsessed ) readers have no doubt been following the coverage of a new study on mortality in Massachusetts in the years following Romneycares coverage expansion , the gist of which  the authors found a striking , Massachusetts-specific decline in death rates for the non-elderly  tends to confirm liberal assumptions about the benefits of health insurance , and undercut the conservative and libertarian argument that insurance doesnt have the impact on health and mortality that most people expect . The studys findings are an almost-diametrical reversal of the results from Oregons Medicaid experiment , which were much discussed around this time last year ( heres my contribution ) , and which seemed to strengthen the conservative critique of Obamacares pursuit of comprehensive coverage . So now its liberalisms turn to claim vindication , and to press Obamacares critics to give ground in the debate .And some ground-giving is appropriate . Megan McArdle , among right-of-center writers , has probably written most extensively on the insurance-and-health question , so I think her response to the new study deserves to be quoted at length: heres my basic take : The study looks pretty good . It is hard to reconcile these results with Oregon . Good Bayesians will update their beliefs accordingly . I can think of reasons to believe Oregon rather than Massachusetts : Its a real [ randomized controlled trial ] , rather than a comparison of counties that are supposed to be similar but might not actually have been in practice . There are surprising results that might be red flags about the data : For instance , cancer mortality dropped , even though the study only ran four years . If the benefit is coming from early detection , I would expect it to take longer to have a significant impact on the data  Massachusetts also has differently sized samples  the control group has about 10 times the population of the treatment group . Since larger groups should tend to have less variance , this might increase the odds of getting a surprisingly good or surprisingly bad result with your treatment group .Most worrying is the period they compared : 2007 to 2010  The authors are not stupid ; they control for unemployment and poverty . But if the financial crisis affected Massachusetts differently from the rest of the country  and it did  then that may well show up in mortality in ways that are hard to measure .That said , I can also think of reasons to believe Massachusetts over Oregon . The treatment group sample is smaller than the control group by quite a lot , but its still huge by comparison with Oregon : 3,900,000 rather than around 6,000 . And Massachusetts is a single comprehensive system , unlike Medicaid , which people might drop in and out of as their income changes , dampening the effect of insurance . The authors find mortality thats amenable to treatment dropping more rapidly than overall mortality . And comparisons with nearby counties , and with the states elderly population , also deliver the same result .So what should we believe ? I havent changed my beliefs radically : I still basically think that health insurance improves mortality rates , but that that improvement is unlikely to be huge if you can get results like Oregon . However , after yesterdays report , Ive revised the probability of huge benefits upward , and you should do the same . And beware of those who are only willing to revise their beliefs in one direction .I completely agree , and I would only add the following point : To the extent that we should revise up the potential health benefits of insurance , we should revise down the extent to which the most rigorous conservative alternative to Obamacare  a reform that would shift the system toward flat , universal subsidies for catastrophic coverage  represents a kind of public policy free ( or at least relatively-inexpensive ) lunch . That is , if the preponderance of the evidence suggests that insurances health benefits are relatively limited , policymakers can hope to reap the cost-containing benefits of bigger co-pays and higher deductibles and health savings accounts without worrying too much that theyre creating gaping chasms between the care people need and the care they can afford and get . But if the Massachusetts study , rather than the Medicaid data or the famous RAND health insurance experiment , gets closer to the typical reality of what a health insurance expansion does , then policymakers are faced with a more explicit trade-off , in which whats saved through market forces by giving people more responsibility for their own health spending has to be balanced against whats lost in foregone care and treatment . And while having that trade-off suddenly look a lot starker than it has to date wouldnt settle the overall debate , it would give liberals a stronger case for their approach .As I noted in an earlier post , the mortality issue is one of several plausible metrics for assessing whether Obamacare succeeds or disappoints , and because of the variance in coverage expansions between red and blue states , presumably researchers will be able to push further on this question over the next five or ten years , and the evidence on one side or the other will look more dispositive . Right now , I would only offer a word of caution for liberals , who are ( understandably ) folding this study together with other positive data points ( falling uninsured numbers in Gallups polling , a brighter deficit picture , good news on some specific policy targets ) to make a case that the empirically-driven conservative critique of Obamacare is in the early stages of collapse .For all we know it might be , but the reality is that on most questions  mortality , deficits , cost containment , and coverage  we are by definition years away from remotely dispositive assessments . The Massachusetts research is only significant because the authors had years of post-Romney data to examine ; going forward , on just about every metric that matters for Obamacare , were looking at a similar timeframe for meaningful numbers and outcomes and results . So if either side , on any of these issues , is going to need to give substantial ground , the only intellectually-responsible way to do it will be  slowly ."
-1	"Update : And the 4th-ranking Republican in the Senate is already accusing the administration of cooking the books . I really think the possibility that the ACA might actually work never occurred to them .Its not in itself that big a deal , but Im somewhat amazed by what amounts to a de facto blackout by major news media on a developing story thats really obvious if you read the invaluable Charles Gaba , or even the White House blog : a huge surge in Obamacare enrollments in the final days of the signup period . The print sources I read are still putting out basically downbeat reports about the ACA , with maybe a mention 10 paragraphs in that exchange enrollments passed the 6 million mark last week . I dont watch cable news , but from what I hear its all still Malaysian airways .In the end , I guess it wont matter in a direct sense ; the final number for year 1 , which looks likely to be very close to the original 7 million projection , will eventually come out . But you wonder why news media that are happy to speculate about the 2016 election arent interested in at least putting out a heads-up about the strong possibility of a bombshell number next week .And where I think this does matter is that it shows a persistent slant in much reporting toward emphasizing the negatives about health reform . The website woes were , and deserved to be , a big story ; the quite amazing comeback somehow doesnt fit the preferred narrative , and is being ignored  and this despite the fact that , as Gaba notes , it offers great visuals too ."

Its an occasion for far-flung conservatives to come together in the Washington , D.C. , area and snuggle in that big tent theyre always talking about . At CPAC , conservatives take stock of all things right wing and set the tone for the year ahead . Theres nothing like it on the liberal side , unless you count Burning Man .Long before the main event , pundits parse the speakers list as if it were a sacred , prophetical text , looking for hints of whats to come . Chris Christies invited ! And so is Ted Cruz ! That must mean theyll both be president . The scheduled panel discussions are less talked about , but equally telling .

Its something I worry about too .On one side , if wonks dont point out what we really should be doing , who will ? To take a current pressing example , it may be that nobody in the British political mainstream is willing to take a stand against austerity , but economists should nonetheless keep pointing out that its really bad policy .On the other hand , if wonks only propose things that wont happen , what good are they ?The best answer I can come up with is to work on two tracks  to talk about first-best policies but also be prepared to support second-best policies if thats what is on offer . Obamacare is a Rube Goldberg device that is nonetheless much better than nothing  and its working . Carbon taxes would be the way to go in a better world , but in this one various administrative actions may be the best you can do .Its a tricky balancing act . You dont want to give up on good ideas and make it seem as if flawed political compromises are better than they are  and if theyre bad enough , you have to oppose them .

Still , state experiences can tell the rest of us something . Theres been a lot of talk lately about how the great Kansas tax-cut experiment is doing , namely very badly . But what about the anti-Kansas  California ? Its a state with a Democratic supermajority . Its policies arent left-wing in the way Kansass are right-wing , but its enough of a liberal agenda to have the right frothing at the mouth . So how is it going ?I wrote about the California comeback more than a year ago , to much vitriolic scorn from the usual suspects . But hows it going now ?Well , David Cay Johnston tells us that job growth remains fast despite predictions of doom from tax hikes . I found myself wondering , however , whether this was just bounceback from an especially severe slump  after all , California was a major housing bubble state , suffered for it , and you would expect a period of relatively fast growth thereafter even if overall performance was lagging the nation .If you look at the numbers , however , what you see is that while fast job growth has indeed largely reflected recovery from an especially deep slump , at this point Californias performance ( blue ) since the Great Recession began has fully matched that of the nation ( red ) ; that is , there is no sign of growth being hurt by liberal policies or whatever:Meanwhile , the budget is in good shape , with room for some much-needed spending increases .Oh , and California  which enthusiastically went about implementing health reform  appears to have cut the number of uninsured by half in the first year of Obamacare .Is it a miracle ? No  or at any rate not unless you consider any deviation from supply-side predictions miraculous . But its looking like a pretty solid record ."
-1	"Participants in Tennessees judicial elections on Thursday rejected a malodorous effort to oust three capable sitting state Supreme Court justices : Chief Justice Gary Wade and Justices Cornelia Clark and Sharon Lee .Conservative Republican groups , including the Republican State Leadership Committee and Americans for Prosperity  part of Charles and David Kochs big-dollar political operation  underwrote a campaign against the judges . For weeks before Thursdays election , they bombarded Tennessee with ads depicting them as soft on crime ,  hostile to business interests and supporters of the Obama agenda and Obamacare. But this was all nonsense : In fact the judges never ruled on a case involving the health care law .Tennessee voters apparently saw through the lies , a victory not only for the three judges but for elected judges everywhere . The outcome of the election is a sign that judges can sign on to controversial decisions without losing their jobs  despite attack ads .The downside of the judges success is that , to achieve it , they raised more than $ 1 million , much of it from lawyers who may appear before them . The judges next challenge is to be diligent about avoiding the appearance and reality of improper conflicts-of-interest by recusing themselves from cases involving significant financial backers .People can smell court tampering and tend to get their backs up ,  says Bert Brandenburg of Justice at State , a group that advocates for the preservation of fair and impartial courts .

Theyve been trying to convert Republicans to market monetarism , but the rights favorite intellectuals keep turning to cranks peddling conspiracy theories about inflation . Three years ago it was Niall Ferguson , citing a bogus source . Ferguson was widely ridiculed , by moderate conservatives as well as liberals  but here comes Amity Shlaes , making the same argument and citing the same source . The reform conservatives have made no headway at all .Why this lack of progress ?The answer is that inflation paranoia isnt a simple misunderstanding that can be corrected by pointing to evidence . Its deeply embedded in the modern conservative psyche . Government action must , by definition , have disastrous results ; and whatever market monetarists may try to say , their political comrades will continue to lump monetary policy in with fiscal stimulus and Obamacare . And fiat money cant work  Francisco DAnconia said so , and it must be true . So its always the 70s , if not Weimar , and if the numbers say otherwise , they must be cooked . Evidence has a well-known liberal bias .Even the rare conservative willing to admit that we dont yet have high inflation wont admit that this suggests something wrong with models that predicted a huge inflation surge . No , its just a miracle .So market monetarism isnt going anywhere , politically .

-1	"HAVING spent the last year reporting for a series of articles on the high cost of American medicine , Ive heard it all . There was Fred Abrahams , 77 , a skier who had surgery on both ankles for arthritis  one in New York for more than $ 200,000 and one in New Hampshire for less than $ 40,000 . There was Matthew Landman , 41 , billed more than $ 100,000 for antivenin administered in an E.R . after a small rattlesnake bite . There was Robin Miller , a Florida businessman , who needed to buy an implantable defibrillator for his ill brother , who was uninsured ; the machine costs tens of thousands of dollars , but he couldnt get a price for a make or a model .Extreme anecdotes , perhaps . But the series has prompted more than 10,000 comments of outrage and frustration  from patients , doctors , politicians , even hospital and insurance executives .As of Jan. 1 , the Affordable Care Act promises for the first time to deliver the possibility of meaningful health insurance to every American . But where does that leave the United States in terms of affordable care ?Even supporters see Obamacare as a first step on a long quest to bring Americans affordable medicine , with further adjustments , interventions and expansions needed .There are plenty of interesting ideas being floated to help repair the system , many of which are being used in other countries , where health care spending is often about half of that in the United States . For example , we could strictly regulate prices or preset payment levels , as is currently done for hospital stays under Medicare , the national insurance program for people over 65 , or at least establish fair price corridors for procedures and drugs . We could require hospitals and doctors to provide price lists and upfront estimates to allow consumers to make better choices . We could stop paying doctors and hospitals for each service they performed and instead compensate them with a fixed monthly fee for taking care of each patient . We could even make medical school free or far cheaper and then require service afterward .But the nation is fundamentally handicapped in its quest for cheaper health care : All other developed countries rely on a large degree of direct government intervention , negotiation or rate-setting to achieve lower-priced medical treatment for all citizens . That is not politically acceptable here . A lot of the complexity of the Affordable Care Act arises from the political need in the U.S. to rely on the private market to provide health care access ,  said Dr. David Blumenthal , a former adviser to President Obama and president of the Commonwealth Fund , a New York-based foundation that focuses on health care .With that political backdrop , Obamacare deals only indirectly with high prices . By regulating and mandating insurance plans , it seeks to create a better , more competitive market that will make care from doctors and hospitals cheaper . But it primarily relies on a trickle-down theory of cost containment . The Princeton health economist Uwe E. Reinhardt has called it a somewhat ugly patch on a somewhat ugly system.With half a billion dollars spent by medical lobbyists each year , according to the Washington-based Center for Responsive Politics , our fragmented profit-driven system is effectively insulated from many of the forces that control spending elsewhere . Even Medicare is not allowed to negotiate drug prices for its tens of millions of beneficiaries , and Americans are forbidden by law to re-import medicines made domestically and sold more cheaply abroad .And so American patients are stuck with bills and treatment dilemmas that seem increasingly Kafkaesque . The hopeful news is that American health care spending has grown at a slower pace over the past four years . While that is partly because of the recession , economists say , many credit the cost-containing forces unleashed by Obamacare with a significant assist . Even at that rate , many models suggest that nearly 25 percent of gross domestic product will be eaten up by health care in 20 years . That is not sustainable .Its like a diet you cant just stop , because its starting to work ,  said Michael Chernew , an economist at Harvard Medical School . And remember , we havent even lost weight yet , were just gaining weight more slowly.Many health economists say we must move away from the so-called fee-for-service model , where doctors and hospitals bill every event , every pill , every procedure , even hourly rental of the operating room . Though insurers try to hold down costs by negotiating discounts or limiting reimbursement , this strategy has limited power because armies of consultants now advise hospitals on what is known as strategic billing : Losing money from trauma patients ? Hospitals can add on a $ 10,000-plus trauma activation fee. Medicare not paying enough for a broken wrist ? Add a separate casting fee to the bill ."

Republicans today elected one of each type , which will probably lead to more tension , more obstruction , and less progress .Kevin McCarthy of California , the new majority leader , is the consensus guy . He supported a clean increase in the debt ceiling in February and helped end the government shutdown last fall . Steve Scalise of Louisiana , the new majority whip , is the obstructionist . He voted against the debt ceiling increase , clearly unconcerned about the effects of a credit default on the economy and on his constituents . And last August , he was one of 80 hard-right members ( right up there with Michele Bachmann , Ted Yoho and Steve King ) who signed a letter saying that their efforts to repeal Obamacare were so important that the health law must be de-funded in appropriations bills . That letter , advocating a tactic that was the brainchild of Senator Ted Cruz , helped spark the shutdown .Mr. Scalises new job will be to round up votes and enforce the leaderships will when a bill needs to pass . In the months to come , Congress will have to choose whether to refill the highway trust fund ( which conservatives want to cut ) and reauthorize the Export-Import Bank ( which they want to kill ) . They will have to choose whether to keep the government open when funding runs out at the end of September . And theres a little thing called immigration reform. If Mr. McCarthy and Speaker John Boehner want to cut deals on those measures to avoid further Republican embarrassments just before the midterm elections , just what is Mr. Scalise going to say when hes asked to find the votes ?The Republican Study Group , the band of policy conservatives that Mr. Scalise has led since 2012 , will want him to say no . ( In fact , there are some House extremists who think he isnt conservative enough , and has tried to push the study group toward the center .

-1	"By now its routine : Another election season , another round of expensive state judicial elections destined to undermine the core American principle of fair and impartial courts .Things got started in earnest at the beginning of May with North Carolinas judicial primary . Attack ads underwritten largely by out-of-state Republican interest groups charged that a sitting state Supreme Court justice , Robin Hudson , coddled child molesters and sided with predators in a dissent while on the bench . Somehow she prevailed despite the negative publicity .Now , a similar battle is taking place in Tennessee in advance of the states judicial elections on Aug. 7 . Three capable members of Tennessees 5-member Supreme Court  Gary Wade , Cornelia Clark and Sharon Lee  are campaigning to keep their seats in up-or-down retention elections . Distorting attack ads portray the three as soft on crime and the death penalty ( citing a case involving ineffective assistance of counsel ) and as supporters of the Obama agenda and Obamacare ( even though they have never ruled on a case involving the health care law ) .There is such a thing as reasoned discussion of candidates judicial records and philosophy . Plainly , 30- second cheap shots dont rise to that level .Tennessees three targeted judges were appointed by the states former Democratic governor , Phil Bredesen ; and the defeat of even one would permit Tennessees current Republican governor , Bill Haslam , to name a replacement , creating a Republican majority on the powerful court . These stakes explain the intense assault unleashed against the trio , led by Tennessees Republican lieutenant governor , Ron Ramsey , and aided and abetted , it appears , by well-heeled conservative groups .Its clear from the startling 2010 defeat of three Iowa Supreme Court justices  whod participated in the unanimous decision to allow same-sex marriage  that judges under attack cant expect to prevail without fighting back . And thats exactly what the three targeted judges are doing , raising significant sums and otherwise relying on support from lawyers who appear before them .But no one should feel good about judges having to grovel for money and campaign like ordinary politicians . In their effort to counter the charge they are too liberal for the red state , moreover , the three targeted judges have engaged in some injudicious politicking themselves , stressing that theyve upheld nearly 90 percent of death sentences , for example . For judges to campaign based on their decisions in criminal cases is a dicey business even when provoked .Still , those who care about judicial independence and integrity should be rooting for the three well-qualified judges . Their ouster would only accelerate the politicization of state justice and send an intimidating message to elected judges nationwide , who may hesitate to render correct but controversial rulings , especially near an election ."

But I think I would say that even if I were less inclined to agree with its policy specifics , because purely as a rhetorical matter , it does something that Mitt Romney didnt manage to do in 2012 until , well , basically the first presidential debate : That is , it tries to meet non-conservative voters where they are and talk about the issues that they say they care about , rather than lecturing them on what they should be concerned about ( too few people are paying income tax ! Obama doesnt like entrepreneurs ! ) and assuming that theyre already persuaded . Its a speech rooted in conservative principle without being trapped by the conservative talking points , in other words , and thats something we saw very little of in the 2012 campaign .So where Republicans are inclined to disagree with some of Rubios proposals , I would join my friend Reihan Salam in suggesting that they should treat his speech as an opportunity to demand that other would-be leaders ( a Ted Cruz , a Scott Walker , whomever ) step forward with alternatives  and just as importantly , explain how they expect to secure a durable majority in their favor . The Republican Party in recent years has featured a great deal of non-substantive debate : The 12 primary season was full of it ( excepting , of course , 9-9-9 ! ) , and the clashes in the House and Senate leading to the government shutdown over who really wants to repeal Obamacare and whos a sell-out squish followed a similar pattern , in which affect and tactics were often the main things up for dispute . But that does not have to be the case in the 2016 campaign : If the partys presidential contenders follow Rubios example , the party could have an actual debate about what it believes should replace Obamacare ( a universal tax credit , or something more limited , like what Bobby Jindal has proposed ? ) , what the details of a potential tax reform should look like ( the vigorous online debate over the child tax credit versus deeper top rate cuts belongs in an actual political campaign ) , how the safety net should actually work ( as opposed to just vague promises to cap its growth ) , even how Social Security should be reformed ( champions of private accounts , tell us why Rubios proposals dont go far enough ! ) . Of course it wont always be a high-minded debate  perish the thought !  but just having these kind of arguments would be immensely constructive , not only for the party , but for the country it aspires to govern .I would add one other other thought on the speech : I see that Rubio was attacked by Danny Vinik at The New Republic for being insufficiently wonky ( because he hasnt specified pay-fors for all his education/safety net proposals ) and by Laura Ingraham on Twitter for being insufficiently exciting ( dare you to try to make it to end of speech w/out nodding off ,  she writes ) . As Ive said before regarding Rubios proposals , the insufficient-specificity complaint strikes me as a bit ridiculous given that 1 ) hes the only 2016 contender offering anywhere close to this level of detail on policy at this point and 2 ) hes explicitly endorsed reforms to Medicare and Social Security that would have a much larger impact on the budget than any of his possible tweaks to education outlays . And Ingrahams insufficiently-exciting complaint sounds a lot like what critics of Bill Clinton always said about his speeches  so long , so much policy , surely voters wont like this . But they did , and they still do .With that said , though , this is a pincer movement that a substantive G.O.P . campaign will have to cope with  parts of the base will find the approach insufficiently combative and exciting , while the liberal press will demand that every policy proposal meet a legislative , C.B.O.-ready standard that I dont precisely recall every Obama campaign promise reaching . So Rubio and any other Republican politician who follows his example will need to be prepared for it ."
-1	"The two big achievements of the Obama administration are health reform and financial reform . ( Maybe carbon regulation will be added to the list ; stay tuned . ) For the most part , however , neither has gotten much respect . I think this may finally be changing on health reform , as the evidence piles up for a dramatic improvement in coverage in states that didnt obstruct the law . But financial reform is still unloved , attacked by the right as anti-business and by the left as too weak to work .There is , however , an important new GAO report suggesting that reform is mattering a lot on one key hot-button issue : too big to fail . Im not , however , seeing much clear writing about this ; the always excellent Mike Konczal is on the case , but I suspect that most readers wont know enough about the background to appreciate whats going on .So heres an explanation . If you go back to what happened in 2008 , you had a situation in which the impending collapse of some key financial institutions threatened to bring down the whole world economy . So they were bailed out  with many people complaining that the bailouts rewarded bad behavior . Indeed , some people  including me  argued for taking troubled banks into receivership , so that none of the bailout would go to stockholders . But key officials at Treasury argued that they didnt have the legal authority .This episode created a concern : now that everyone knew that big financial institutions would be bailed out if they went bad , wouldnt this ( a ) give such too-big-to-fail institutions a continuing advantage , because their government guaranteed safety would make them able to borrow cheaply , and ( b ) encourage irresponsible behavior ? And there was a fair bit of evidence for ( a ) : large financial institutions did indeed seem to have a funding advantage .To deal with this , Dodd-Frank created Ordinary Liquidation Authority , otherwise known as resolution authority  giving the government the legal authority to seize institutions the way it arguably should have in 2008-2009 .But Republican leaders fiercely opposed financial reform  and claimed that resolution authority actually made too-big-to-fail worse , because it institutionalized bailouts . This always seemed implausible ; bailouts will happen in crises , one way or another . And if financial reform was a giveaway to the banks , why did Wall Street , which used to look relatively favorably on Democrats , turn overwhelmingly Republican after reform passed ?Still , youd like some evidence . And GAO has the goods . There was indeed a large-bank funding advantage during and for some time after the crisis , but it has now been diminished or gone away  maybe even slightly reversed . That is , financial markets are now acting as if they believe that future bailouts wont be as favorable to fat cats as the bailouts of 2008 .This news is part of broader evidence that Dodd-Frank has actually done considerable good , on fronts from consumer protection to bank capitalization . Of course it should have been stronger ; and I dont expect it ever to look as good as Obamacare increasingly does . But claims that it was counterproductive now look like claims that black is white . Are you surprised ?"

He led the Republican Party in the United States Senate in the 1940s and early 1950s , ran for the Republican nomination for president three times and was known as Mr . Republican. If he were alive today , I can assure you he wouldnt even recognize the modern Republican Party , which has repeatedly brought the United States of America to the edge of a fiscal cliff  seemingly with every intention of pushing us off the edge .Throughout my familys more than 170-year legacy of public service , Republicans have represented the voice of fiscal conservatism . Republicans have been the adults in the room . Yet somehow the current generation of party activists has managed to do what no previous Republicans have been able to do  position the Democratic Party as the agents of fiscal responsibility .Speaking through the night , Senator Ted Cruz , with heavy-lidded , sleep-deprived eyes , conveyed not the libertarian element in Republican philosophy that advocates for smaller government and less intrusion into the personal lives of citizens , but a new , virulent strain of empty nihilism : blow it up if we cant get what we want.This recent display of bomb-throwing obstructionism by Republicans in Congress evokes another painful , historically embarrassing chapter in the Republican Party  that of Senator Joseph McCarthy , chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations , whose anti-Communist crusade was allowed by Republican elders to expand unchecked , unnecessarily and unfairly tarnishing the reputations of thousands of people with Red Scare accusations of Communist affiliation . Finally Senator McCarthy was brought up short during the questioning of the United States Armys chief counsel , Joseph N. Welch , who at one point demanded the senators attention , then said : Until this moment , Senator , I think I never really gauged your cruelty or your recklessness. He later added : Have you no sense of decency , sir ? At long last , have you left no sense of decency ? Watching the Republican Party use the full faith and credit of the United States to try to roll back Obamacare , watching its members threaten not to raise the debt limit  which Warren Buffett rightly called a political weapon of mass destruction  to repeal a tax on medical devices , I so wanted to ask a similar question : Have you no sense of responsibility ? At long last , have you left no sense of responsibility ? There is more than a passing similarity between Joseph McCarthy and Ted Cruz , between McCarthyism and the Tea Party movement . The Republican Party survived McCarthyism because , ultimately , its excesses caused it to burn out . And eventually party elders in the mold of my grandfather were able to realign the party with its brand promise : The Republican Party is ( or should be ) the Stewardship Party . The Republican brand is ( or should be ) about responsible behavior . The Republican party is ( or should be ) at long last , about decency .What a long way we have yet to go ."
-1	"The health care ads being run by Americans for Prosperity  one of the many frantically waving arms of the Koch brothers  are a gift to fact checkers everywhere . Because they deliberately twist the truth to persuade people to stop supporting Obamacare ,  they have become a machine for producing Pinocchios ,  the mendacity rating system used by Glenn Kessler at The Washington Post .In todays installment , Mr. Kessler gave two Pinocchios ( out of four ) to three A.F.P . ads that went up this week . He dinged the ad below for falsely claiming that health insurance premiums are up by 90 percent in New Hampshire .And he criticized this series of ads for suggesting that hundreds of thousands of people in Michigan and Colorado lost their insurance because of the Affordable Care Act , without pointing out that many of those policies were later extended or renewed .Those Pinocchios are fine as far as they go . But since this is an editorial-page blog , we can go a little further than Mr. Kessler and toss many more long noses at the Koch ads . ( Does this dial go to 11 ? )Whats truly erroneous about all these ads ( the full series of which is available on the A.F.P . website , if you have the fortitude ) isnt so much what they say as what they never say . They give viewers the impression that all the pre-existing problems with the health insurance system are the fault of Mr. Obamas law , never bothering to explain how bad things have been for decades .For example , its true that health insurance premiums will be going up for some people under the new system , in most cases because they will have better coverage . But premiums for private insurance have been rapidly escalating for years , far beyond inflation . Since 2003 , they went up by 80 percent , according to the Kaiser Family Foundation , nearly three times as fast as wages and inflation . And the ads never mention the millions who will now get insurance coverage for free or extremely low cost because of the programs subsidies . Those people arent the Kochs intended audience .Similarly , insurance companies used to routinely cancel individual policies , sometimes because the policy holders got sick , or because the companies decided not to do business in a state or region anymore . They cant do that now . But the ads never mention that , instead falsely suggesting that vast numbers of ordinary people have been left without coverage because of the law .As Politico reported yesterday , a new study says that millions of the so-called cancelled policies under the Affordable Care Act ( which were actually policy upgrades ) would have been cancelled anyway by the policyholders . Most people who have individual policies dont keep them for longer than a year , either because they join a new employers plan or change their own policies .Thats the kind of context you will never get in a Koch ad , whether or not the texts of the ads are literally correct . The billionaires behind this effort are on a crusade to end Democratic control of the Senate and ultimately to discredit the idea that government can improve peoples lives through a social program . Context just gets in their way ."
-1	"If you care deeply about the distinctions between various types of Republicans  not a hobby Id recommend for those without professional training  you might be aware that Thad Cochran of Mississippi is not a particularly conservative senator .Most liberals probably dismiss him as hopelessly retrograde , like the rest of his party . After all , as he put it in an ad for his re-election , hes the only candidate in the race who has been endorsed by the National Rifle Association . Hes voted against Obamacare more than 100 times. And he has what he calls a 100 percent pro-life voting record ,  as compiled by the National Right to Life Committee .But for conservatives , Mr. Cochran is no conservative . He might have been by the standards of 1978 , when he first came to the Senate , but the Republican Party has passed him by on its rush to the right , and now a Tea Party candidate has a pretty good shot at defeating him in the June 3 primary . Mr. Cochran spent too many years getting federal projects for his state , and even provided federal aid after Hurricane Katrina .By contrast , his opponent , a state senator named Chris McDaniel , isnt even sure he supports federal disaster spending .Mr. McDaniel is being assisted by several well-funded outside groups who have long had their eyes on Mr. Cochran for various crimes against conservatism . In an ad released on Monday , the Club for Growth goes through the list : Mr. Cochran voted with President Jimmy Carter ( the narrator practically laughs at the last name ) to massively expand federal control of education. Thats apparently a reference to the 1979 vote that created the Department of Education . He supported the 1990 tax increase that made President George H.W . Bush break his read my lips pledge . And worst of all , he voted with President Obama to raise the national debt by trillions ( this refers to a decision not to let the government default on its debts ) .Thad Cochran  five decades in Washington is enough ,  the ad says .Freedom Works Action , a Tea Party group , has an ad calling Mr. Cochran the ultimate insider . In just the last six years , hes voted for over $ 36 billion of pork ,  the ad says . And not a dime of that money came to Mississippi.The last sentence muddies the message a bit , a reminder of the old axiom that theres nothing worse than pork that doesnt benefit local voters .But the larger point is clear : Mr. Cochran no longer fits in a Republican Party that values purity above governance , and needs to be purged as Richard Lugar and Robert Bennett were before him .As another right-wing insurgent group , the Madison Project , explains on its website , Mr. Cochran may have voted against various health-reform provisions , but he has voted for federal budgets that paid for the law . ( In other words , he opposes shutting down the government to block the law . ) Hes voted for background checks for guns , and his anti-abortion record isnt as solid as he says it is .Theyre right about that . Mr. Cochrans 100 percent pro-life voting record is only true for the last few Congresses . If you go back a few years on the National Right to Life website , youll see that Mr. Cochran dared to vote for stem-cell research in 2006 , and fetal-tissue research in 1997 .Those kinds of votes  courageous if he repeated them now  are why Mr. Cochran is struggling hard against the new mainstream of his party in a close primary race that seems eons away from 1978 ."
-1	"THE Obama administration has made a curious strategic choice in its defense of the constitutionality of the health care reform act . The central issue before the Supreme Court , which will begin hearing oral arguments on Monday , is whether the acts requirement that everyone buy health insurance  the so-called individual mandate  exceeds Congresss constitutional power .The acts other provisions regulating health insurance  like the requirement that health insurance companies take all applicants , regardless of pre-existing illnesses , and the prohibition against charging sicker patients higher rates  have not been challenged . And yet the administration is arguing that the individual mandate is not severable from these regulations ; if the mandate falls , they must as well , and health insurance companies would once again be free to choose whom to cover .But if the court were to strike down the individual mandate , it should stop there : that would be quite bold enough . The Supreme Court has long affirmed a presumption in favor of severability ,  meaning that when it rules that a statutory provision is unconstitutional , the decision should affect as little of the law as possible . As Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said , while speaking for the court in 2010 , making more extensive changes would constitute editorial freedom that belongs to the legislature , not the judiciary.It is Congress , not the court , that has the constitutional power and responsibility to make difficult legislative policy decisions like these . By arguing against severability , the Obama administration  and the laws opponents , who are making an even more radical claim  is urging the Supreme Court to abandon its tradition of judicial restraint , to ignore longstanding precedents and to undermine the separation of powers .Perhaps it comes as no surprise that the opponents of the law , which they call Obamacare ,  agree with the administration on this crucial point . They have even urged the Supreme Court to strike down the entire statute , including the acts many provisions that have nothing to do with health insurance coverage , like those relating to doctor training and the regulation of certain drugs . They would like nothing more than for the court to save Congress the trouble of having to muster the votes to try to repeal the law .To this end , the laws opponents have advanced several specious arguments . Because the act is so complex , they say , the court does not have the expertise to decide whether only one provision can be excised from it . In addition , because the statute was the product of hard-fought political compromise , every provision was necessary to secure a majority of votes , and the removal of any one would upset the delicate deal that was struck .But complexity is a key reason for the severability doctrine in the first place : it is Congress that has the expertise and responsibility to decide what should be kept absent the individual mandate . And virtually every statute reflects a bundle of political deals . If either of these arguments is accepted , it would destroy the doctrine of severability entirely .Both the Obama administration and the laws opponents have one argument in common . They express concern about what might happen to health insurance markets if the mandate is severed from the statute but the requirements that insurance companies cover sick patients and dont charge them higher rates remain . If healthy people do not have to buy insurance and insurance companies are forced to cover the sick , they warn , insurance would be far more expensive . No doubt rates would rise as a result . But the size of that increase  whether it would be 10 percent or 20 percent , as some claim  is unknown , and the Supreme Court is in no position to make that judgment on its own .Its not clear why the Obama administration has chosen this course . Perhaps it made a strategic choice to raise the stakes of striking down the mandate by asking the court to also invalidate the laws more popular provisions . Or it may be concerned that , if the mandate alone is struck down , there would not be enough votes in Congress to pass new provisions to compensate the insurance industry for its loss . But as a legal matter , the court should reject the argument .We believe that imposing the mandate was within Congresss powers to regulate commerce and that the legislation should be upheld . But if the Supreme Court strikes the mandate down , the rest of the law should stand , and Congress should have to decide what happens next .Why should an unelected court free the insurance industry from having to do its own political lobbying work in Congress ? Why should the court choose whether or not to deny injured and sick Americans health insurance ? These crucial decisions must be left to our elected officials , who  unlike the Supreme Court  can then be held accountable for them by the voting public ."
-1	"My Sunday column divided American conservatisms would-be populist reformers into two camps , reform conservatives and libertarian populists ,  and tried to briefly describe the overlap and distinctions between the two . Ive made this distinction before , and like any binary its in some sense artificial : You could easily fold both groups into a broad reformist tendency , or disaggregate them further into smaller camps . But I do think the typology is pretty useful , for various reasons  one of which is that it helps clarify two of the gravitational pulls ( from very different directions ) that todays conservative reformers need to at least partially escape .To see what I mean about those pulls , let me quote Ben Domenech , who first popularized the term libertarian populist ,  using his newsletter to respond to my own and Ramesh Ponnurus attempts to distinguish our ideas from Bush-era compassionate conservatism: compassionate conservatism such as it is  a marketing gimmick which deploys altruism in defense of big government solutions  is very much alive  among the nations Republican governors . John Kasich and Mike Pence and Chris Christie are all expanding Medicaid under Obamacare by deploying the same familiar terms of caring about the downtrodden and having a heart for the poor  citing the need to follow the path of Jesus and Reagan as their motivation for taxing others to pay for entitlements . Describing a permanent expansion of an entitlement for childless able-bodied adults as a hand up not a hand out is classic compassionate conservatism Now in context , this talk of compassionate conservatism rebranding is aimed at the efforts of the reform conservatives , who are eager to avoid the critique that this is just a bunch of Bush veterans attempting to rebrand their past policy agenda in terms which can survive in the new climate of the right .To the extent that their ideas are attempting to make compassionate conservatism actually conservative , their work has merit  to the extent that their ideas are relocation grants and wage subsidies and Keynesian transportation projects , not so much ( Everybody always starts with Michael Strain !  ) . To a large extent , the more skeptical reformers are of government action , the more their ideas resist this accusation . As John Podhoretz noted in his 2008 review of Michael Gersons Heroic Conservatism , the most troubling aspect of this defense of compassion was its historically revisionist depiction of the heartlessness of welfare reform  Thus I dont think its fair to describe Paul Ryans attempts , which largely accept the lessons of those reforms , in these terms . Thats why what reformers are advancing requires the acceptance of the anti-cronyism , anti-corporatist element of the agenda as essential , not just window dressing . In a sense , its a demonstration of good faith : that they are willing to take on established interests in a way which could prove painful , just as weve seen politicians on the left do in the past . The more one is willing to take sides against such interests , the more you can be trusted as someone who isnt just trying to rebrand the Bush domestic policies .I think that most of this argument is both fair-minded and important . For reform conservatism , there is an obligation to explain ( as weve tried to do ) why ours isnt just a politics that reliably deploys the rhetoric of altruism or compassion in defense of big government solutions ,  and why our preferred policies wouldnt just cycle the G.O.P . back into the same K Street Project/deficits dont matter miasma that came to define the Bush eras attempt at a fresh center-right policy approach . And Domenech is right that the anti-corporatist , anti-insider element in the reform agenda is one of the places ( the other , I would say , being entitlement reform ) where the limited-government rubber hits the road : By prioritizing issues that libertarians tend to care about and the Bush-era party didnt really touch  corporate welfare , market-distorting regulations , the tax codes giveaways to rentiers  reform conservatism can escape ( or try to ) the gravitational pull of big government conservatism , and demonstrate that ours isnt just the royal road back to the reign of Tom DeLay .But I think the middle of his argument points to a gravitational pull thats problematic for libertarian populists  namely , the tug of a libertarianism too dogmatic to temper its skepticism of government action with an awareness that certain governmental interventions actually might work . Domenech first criticizes the relocation grants and wage subsidies element in reform conservatisms policy portfolio , and then suggests ( reasonably ) that reform conservatism should be judged , in part , by whether it seems to follow in the footsteps of the mid-1990s welfare reform  without acknowledging that one of the reasons that welfare overhaul seems to have worked reasonably well for the poor ( contributing to lower poverty rates , lower child poverty rates , , etc . ) was that it was packaged together with , well , wage subsidies like the E.I.T.C . And yes , absent those interventions , there would have still been a principled limited-government case for the reform  but more liberal prophecies about its impact on poverty rates might have been vindicated , and fewer non-libertarian observers would have been inclined to see it as a success .Or so I think , at least . Todays libertarian populists dont have to agree with that assessment , and if they do allow that it has merit , that doesnt require them to support further wage supports right now . But just as Domenechs advice for reform conservatives is worth taking seriously , I hope he and others take seriously the need to make sure that their libertarianism doesnt swallow their populism on issues where conservative public policy might be able to actually offer the working poor and working class a genuine hand up ."
-1	"I havent commented on the border situation since my column a few weeks ago , mostly because its the kind of situation ( there are so many these days ) where its easier to say what should have been done in the past than to figure out what the correct policy course is right now . But as House Republicans debate what kind of legislative response they intend to support , I want to say something briefly about the argument that they shouldnt back any response at all , on the theory that since the president has already claimed sweeping , dubiously-legal powers over spending flows and immigration enforcement , fixing the mess should be his responsibility alone .Thats the case that Conn Carroll presses here , citing the White Houses creative funding moves with Obamacares exchanges and its suspension of deportations for younger illegal aliens as evidence that in this case , too , the president could simply spend more and speed deportations on his own initiative , notwithstanding the official absence of money and the apparent letter of the law forbidding swift repatriation of juveniles from Central America . And unless the White House wants to walk back its earlier power grab , Carroll argues , thats exactly what the G.O.P . should let happen here:Until Obama admits his entire DACA program [ the halt to deportations for immigrants brought here as children ) is blatantly illegal , and that his funding of Obamacare exchanges was also blatantly illegal , and then acts to enforce federal laws and appropriations as written  there simply is zero reason for Republicans in Congress to do anything .Obama has repeatedly proven through both his actions and rhetoric that he could care less what federal law , or appropriations , say . He is going to do what he wants to do anyway .Republicans must refuse to legitimize this farce .I share Carrolls frustration with the presidents conduct of immigration policy , but I dont think the logic here quite makes sense . Republicans would be responding to a presidential power grab in one area by essentially demanding that he expand that power grab even further , and washing their own hands of a crisis situation while they wait to see if hell act without them . Wouldnt that kind of stand-down legitimize presidential overreach much more than passing the actual bill that Republicans believe is legally and constitutionally required ?It would be one thing if the G.O.P . genuinely didnt think anything should be done about the current crisis : Then they could stand by their inaction on principle and blast the president for making extralegal moves . But the partys official ( and correct ! ) position is that we need more funding for immigration enforcement , both in the context of the current inflow and more generally , and that the Wilberforce Acts guarantee of hearings should not be applied to most of todays child migrants . Regardless of what the president does or doesnt do , I just dont see what Republicans lose from passing legislation that reflects both positions : If the president fails to execute it faithfully or if it ends up amended in some counterproductive way , they can attack the White House and the Democrats for that , without carrying the burden of looking like do-nothings who are weirdly demanded more of the kind of executive creativity they officially oppose .There is also the argument , raised by Mickey Kaus , that House Republicans shouldnt pass anything because it wouldnt just get amended or creatively interpreted , but because it could set in motion a conference process that could lead to a comprehensive reform being essentially smuggled through the House . Now I bow to no one in my belief that some Republican leaders would love to somehow put one over on their conservative constituents on this issue , but I also do not believe that the Republican leadership is literally insane . And allowing the Kaus Trojan Horse scenario to unfold , just before a midterm election , with party unity fragile ( especially on this issue ) , with polls moving in the G.O.P.s direction on immigration for the first time in a while  well , it would be the most extraordinary act of Republican self-immolation I can possibly imagine , and thats really saying something .And again , in order to close the door on the extremely-slim possibility of a suicidal betrayal by their leadership , House Republicans would end up sitting on their hands , punting to the White House , and essentially shirking legislative obligations that they themselves believe they have . I may be missing something here , but I just dont see how that makes sense ."
-1	"HANOVER , N.H.  NOW that its clear that Obamacare is here to stay , its supporters should focus on making the program better . Fixes are not a sign of weakness . They are a sign of responsiveness and of good management . And the Affordable Care Act does have its flaws . Heres a big one : It favors screening over diagnosis .While the distinction may seem arcane , it has real-world implications . Screening is what we offer to the well ; its the effort to find abnormalities in those who do not have signs or symptoms of disease . Because screening is considered part of preventive care under the Affordable Care Act , it is provided at no charge .Diagnosis is what we offer to those who do have signs or symptoms of disease . Because diagnosis is not preventive care , it is subject to deductibles and co-payments .In other words : A woman over 40 can have a free screening mammogram . But if she notices a breast lump and goes to her doctor to have it evaluated , shell pay for a diagnostic mammogram . That could cost $ 300 . So the woman at lower risk for cancer  the one with no signs or symptoms of the disease  has an incentive to be tested , while the woman at higher risk  the one with the lump  faces a disincentive .Does that make any sense ? No . But it could encourage women with breast lumps not to report their symptoms .Just how crazy this is became apparent to me when a friend enrolled on the New Hampshire exchange . Melissa is a 50-something self-employed author . She chose to be screened for colon cancer using the test doctors are most certain lowers colon cancer mortality  annual fecal occult blood testing .Melissas screening test was free under the Affordable Care Act . It was also positive  she had blood in her stool , meaning she was at higher risk to actually have colon cancer . Everyone agreed about the next step : a diagnostic colonoscopy , to figure out where the blood was coming from . Thats not free ; its real money , thousands of dollars . But had she chosen the colonoscopy as her first screening test , it would have been free .Melissa contacted her insurer , and a representative suggested she ask her gastroenterologist to resubmit the colonoscopy claim as preventive . Pressure on doctors to recode diagnostic tests as screening tests is the inevitable result of this incentive mismatch between screening and diagnosis . But its also fraud , and Melissa knew it was wrong .The gastroenterologists already got one fix in the Affordable Care Act . At first , screening colonoscopy was free , but if the test found a polyp , it was correctly reclassified as a diagnostic procedure , and was subject to cost sharing . In February 2013 , regulators fixed the problem , saying insurance companies must also make polyp removal during screening free , noting , polyp removal is an integral part of a colonoscopy.Its true : Subsequent interventions are an integral part of all screening . Were I a mammographer , Id happily argue that additional mammographic views , ultrasounds , M.R.I.s and breast biopsies are all part of screening .But if you notice a new breast lump , you pay .I wish money wasnt such a powerful incentive in medical care . But the economists are right : Incentives matter . Right now they favor lower risk patients ( those being screened ) over higher risk ones ( those with signs and symptoms ) .They also encourage a feeding frenzy among providers to recategorize diagnostic testing as screening . Free screenings were seen as a way to get people through the door and ideally to find and address problems before they become more dangerous and expensive .But in practice , it may not work this way . Some hospitals offer free screening knowing full well that the costs will be more than made up for by all the subsequent services required . More testing , false alarms and overdiagnosis are all part of screening . And if you make it free , patients are less likely to give proper consideration to these potential harms  not to mention the potential for a lot of out-of-pocket costs down the line .Heres the fix : Eliminate the incentive mismatch between screening and diagnosis . Treat them equally . Melissa would share in the cost of her fecal occult blood test . ( But at around $ 10 to $ 20 , its still roughly one one-hundredth of the cost of a colonoscopy . )We need people to consider medical care carefully , and thats what cost sharing is all about . Patients already share costs on what is arguably the most important preventive service , treatment for really high blood pressure , and for procedures as necessary as setting a broken leg . Why would we treat a much closer call  screening  any different ?But if you think the need for this fix is evidence that the Affordable Care Act should be repealed , think again . Melissa had a mammogram at age 29 because her doctor thought she felt a lump . It was just fibrous tissue , but as a result , insurance companies put a rider on her policy disqualifying her from coverage for breast cancer . Thats right : Before the Affordable Care Act , if she developed the cancer that leads to the most deaths among nonsmoking women , she would not have been covered . No one wants to go back there ."

Inside , there is the stale odor of dead air .I know another woman who called me about a corpse lying outside her window for six and a half hours . This was because of cutbacks at the morgue . No dignity in death here . They do it better in Baghdad .The latest trend ? When a person is murdered , he is thrown into an abandoned house , and it is set on fire . There are tens of thousands to choose from .I know of an 11-year-old boy who was shot , the bullet going clean through his arm . The cops stuffed him in the back of a squad car and rushed him to the hospital . Thats how we do it . There was no ambulance available . About two-thirds of the citys fleet is broken on an average day .I know a cop who drives around in a squad car with holes in the floorboards . There is no computer , no air-conditioning , the odometer reading 147,000 miles . His bulletproof vest has expired . His pay has been cut 10 percent .I knew a firefighter who died in a fire , but not from the fire . He died when the roof of an abandoned house collapsed on him and his brethren could not find him because his homing alarm was broken and did not sound . He suffocated .In our town , the 911 dispatch system recently went down for 15 hours , and no one seemed to give a damn . When the system is running , the average wait is 58 minutes . Firefighters cant use hydraulic ladders on fire trucks to do their jobs unless there is an immediate threat to life. In a fire  imagine that . The ladders havent been inspected in years .If this were New York , these stories would have ricocheted around the world . But this is Detroit and , of course , nobody gives a damn . Even here people have been conditioned to accept these things as normal , a nuisance , the buzz of a fly .This numbness , in a peculiar way , is a sign of strength . People here manage to get along somehow .So we went broke , bust , bankrupt . Weve known that in Detroit for years . Only now it is official with a Chapter 9 filing last week . The biggest municipal default in United States history  at least $ 18 billion . Suddenly , America gives a rip .How did it get this way , Im asked ? After all , it was just 99 years ago that Henry Ford offered the workingman $ 5 a day and profit-sharing . How , in less than a century , did it come to this ?The short answers : municipal mismanagement , race riots , white flight , black flight , dead flight ( people routinely disinter their deceased and relocate them to the suburbs ) . There were the overreaching unions and management that couldnt balance a ball . Proof ? The multibillion-dollar bailout of the auto industry . Thank you , American taxpayers !Then there is our spectacular civic corruption : A former mayor , Kwame M. Kilpatrick , waits for a bed in federal prison , convicted of extortion , racketeering and bribery . He looted the city of millions of dollars and stole the future of thousands of children . They can send him to hell for all I care . I dont want to pay for his upkeep . But thank you , taxpayers ! You will pay for it . And the ex-mayors team of super lawyers will also be paid with the public dime .So Detroit files for bankruptcy . What does this mean ? Pay close attention because it may be coming to you soon , Los Angeles , Baltimore , Chicago , Philadelphia . In 2011 , Moodys calculated the unfunded liabilities for Illinoiss three largest state-run pension plans to be $ 133 billion . ( It is expected to be even larger this year . ) Thats the size of six Detroit bankruptcies  give or take a few hundred million .Of Detroits debt of at least $ 18 billion , about $ 7 billion is secured by collateral like casino revenues and utility taxes . That means creditors  read : big banks  will get paid . Of the remaining $ 11 billion dollars or so in unsecured debt , about $ 9 billion is owed to retirees and current municipal workers , people like firefighters and police officers . These debts come in the form of promised pension checks and health care benefits , all backed by a false , unsecured promise . These are the people who are likely to lose out .In simple math , do we sacrifice 30,000 former and current workers to save a city of 700,000 people and their progeny ? Most Detroiters will tell you yes . Dont judge . We feel bad about it . But were simply Americans . We are a gaunt dog . We are desperate . And you are watching and studying us .Pension checks will be much smaller than planned and health care benefits will get foisted off on Medicaid and Obamacare . Thanks again , taxpayers !There is hope up here on the Great Lakes . We have fresh water , profitable auto companies , more than $ 130 billion a year in trade with Canada crossing through our city , a world-class research university and , eventually , a clean balance sheet . Hey , it helps to be first . What do you have , Atlanta ?So come visit Detroit , my fellow Americans . Come take a look at your future . Come give the tires a kick . And if you want your money back , come strip copper pipes and wiring from the abandoned buildings  if you can find any copper . Chances are , someone beat you to it ."
-1	"For our time off together around Christmas , my siblings , their children and I recently began plotting an excursion to the Six Flags amusement park in the Los Angeles area . The discussion turned quickly from roller coasters to perks . To status . To just how high were prepared to fly in this service-obsessed , luxury-laden , class-fractured era of ours .Do we occupy the dizziest heights of privilege ? Or is ours a humbler altitude , and by how much ? Six Flags doesnt use that language , but it might as well , because it offers some half-dozen gradations of access and coddling , from a high-priced position near the front of every line to a much less expensive ticket and much longer waits . There are levels  regular , gold , platinum  and they suggest that the experience is more than just a sprawling day of dips , whirls and happy shrieks . Its a referendum on your very station in society . I dont recall anything quite like it from the amusement parks of my youth . Back then our lives as consumers , and as Americans , didnt seem so relentlessly tiered .Much has been made of commercial flights these days , with all those divisions between first class and coach . For various supplements or with various deals , you can get a few more inches of legroom or , shy of that , a prime aisle seat . You can get to board earlier or later , and thus hoard or miss out on the overhead bins . Will it be long before theres a ranked queue for the bathroom ? Im not even sure Im kidding .Its not that pecking orders or badges of affluence are anything new . Our homes , cars , clubs and clothes have long been advertisements of our economic clout , used and perceived that way .But lately , the places and ways in which Americans are economically segregated and stratified have multiplied , with microclimates of exclusivity popping up everywhere . The plane mirrors the sports arena , the theater , the gym . Is it any wonder that class tensions simmer ? In a country of rising income inequality and an economy thats moved from manufacturing to services , one thing we definitely make in abundance is distinctions .When I grew up , school essentially came in two sizes : public or private . Now , private is a starting point , with many costly but broadly employed add-ons : the tutor for specific subjects ; the tutor for SATs ; the individual sports coach ; the college-admissions consultant , whose fee can exceed $ 5,000 .With taxis as with Boeings , there are degrees of pampering . Uber , a relatively new car service in dozens of American cities , allows you to specify , just minutes before your vehicles arrival , precisely how regal and roomy it should be . If you see yourself in an S.U.V. , then an S.U.V . is the chariot in which others will see you , too .Broadway theaters have premium seating , which is so expensive that a high roller can often get the best real estate at the last minute . Its as if scalping has come out of the closet , louder and prouder in an age of unapologetic elitism . Luxury boxes now take up more space in stadiums than ever ; elsewhere in some ballparks , the differences between sections involve not just better views but finer food and a more solicitous staff .No sooner does a fitness trend appear than it spawns strata , so that you can spin in candlelight at SoulCycle , in less gilded trappings at Crunch , or in bare-bones fashion at the Y.M.C.A . Theres an accordant price scale . Even the fanciest gyms have rungs of enhanced fanciness , such as executive locker rooms . At Equinox , trainers are designated by numbers  Tiers 1 , 2 and 3  that signal their experience and hourly rate , and there are deluxe inner sanctums within certain Equinox clubs . They use eye-scanning technology to figure out who belongs .Bronze , silver , gold , platinum : a vocabulary once associated with jewelry or Olympic medals is now attached to your Hertz status , your Delta level , your Obamacare plan , establishing how far forward or back in the pack you belong , herding you into categories that sound suspiciously like evaluations of worth . This is how precious you are .And while part of whats happening is just a refinement of niche marketing and personalized service for the wealthiest Americans at the tippy top , the stratification travels beyond and below that echelon , to communal events at which everyone can see which plateau everyone else inhabits , Six Flags being an example .It has something called The Flash Pass , named for the superhero . A regular version of it costs at least $ 50 on top of general admission , but for at least $ 80 , you get faster access to rides , and for $ 110 , you get that plus the ability to go around on a ride twice in a row . Your second spin pre-empts some eager , nearby aspirants first .For reasons besides thrift , my vote is that my family not go that route ."
-1	"WASHINGTON  THE Tea Party has a new crusade : preventing illegal immigrants from gaining citizenship , which they say is giving amnesty to lawbreakers . Judson Phillips , the founder of Tea Party Nation , recently told Politico that his members were more upset about the amnesty bill than they were about Obamacare.Theyre so upset , in fact , that Republican supporters of immigration reform , like Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina , have become marked men in their party , while House Republicans have followed the Tea Party lead by refusing to even consider the Senates bipartisan reform plan .Tea Partyers often style themselves as disciples of Thomas Jefferson , the high apostle of limited government . But by taking the ramparts against immigration , the movement is following a trajectory that looks less like the glorious arc of Jeffersons Republican Party than the suicidal path of Jeffersons great rivals , the long-forgotten Federalists , who also refused to accept the inexorable changes of American demography .The Federalists began as the faction that supported the new Constitution , with its federal framework , rather than the existing model of a loose confederation of states . They were the national party , claiming to represent the interests of the entire country .Culturally , however , they were identified with the ancient stock of New England and the mid-Atlantic , as the other major party at the time , the Jeffersonian Republicans ( no relation to todays Republicans ) , were with the South .The Federalists held together for the first few decades , but in 1803 the Louisiana Purchase  Jeffersons great coup  drove a wedge between the partys ideology and its demography . The national party was suddenly faced with a nation that looked very different from what it knew : in a stroke , a vast new territory would be opened for colonization , creating new economic and political interests , slavery among them .The people of the East can not reconcile their habits , views and interests with those of the South and West ,  declared Thomas Pickering , a leading Massachusetts Federalist .Every Federalist in Congress save John Quincy Adams voted against the Louisiana Purchase . Adams , too , saw that New England , the cradle of the revolution , had become a small part of a new nation . Change being found in nature ,  he wrote stoically ,  can not be resisted.But resist is precisely what the Federalists did . Fearing that Irish , English and German newcomers would vote for the Jeffersonian Republicans , they argued  unsuccessfully  for excluding immigrants from voting or holding office , and pushed to extend the period of naturalization from 5 to 14 years .Leading Federalists even plotted to establish a separate government in New England ,  as William Plumer , a senator from New Hampshire , later conceded . ( The plot collapsed only when the proposed military leader , Aaron Burr , killed the proposed political guide , Alexander Hamilton . )The Federalists later drummed out Adams , who voted with the Jeffersonian Republicans to impose an embargo on England in retaliation for English harassment of American merchant ships and impressment of American sailors . This was the foreshadowing moment of the War of 1812 , which the Anglophile Federalists stoutly opposed .Finally , in the fall of 1814 , the Federalists convened the Hartford Convention to vote on whether to stay in or out of the Union . By then even the hotheads realized how little support they had , and the movement collapsed . And the Federalists , now scorned as an anti-national party , collapsed as well .Contrast that defiance with Jeffersons Republicans , who stood for decentralized government and the interests of yeoman farmers , primarily in the coastal South .They ruled the country from 1801 to 1825 , when they were unseated by Adams  who , after splitting with the Federalists , had joined with a breakaway Republican faction .In response , Jeffersons descendants , known as the Old Radicals , did exactly what the Federalists would not do : they joined up with the new Americans , many of them immigrants , who were settling the country opened up by the Louisiana Purchase .Their standard-bearer in 1828 , Andrew Jackson , favored tariffs and internal improvements like roads and canals , the big-government programs of the day . The new party , known first as the Democratic-Republicans , and then simply as the Democrats , thrashed Adams that year . ( Adamss party , the National Republicans , gave way to the Whigs , which in turn evolved into the modern Republican Party . )Todays Republicans are not likely to disappear completely , like the Federalists did . But Republican leaders like Mr. Rubio and Mr. Graham understand that a party that seeks to defy demography , relying on white resentment toward a rising tide of nonwhite newcomers , dooms itself to permanent minority status . Opposing big government is squarely in the American grain ; trying to hold back the demographic tide is quixotic . Professional politicians do not want to become the party of a legacy class .The problem is that the Tea Party is not a party , and its members are quite prepared to ride their hobbyhorse into a dead end . And many Republicans , at least in the House , seem fully prepared to join them there , and may end up dragging the rest of the party with them .The example of those early days shows that American political parties once knew how to adapt to a changing reality . It is a lesson many seem to have forgotten ."
-1	"ITHACA , N.Y.  SEVENTY-FIVE years ago today , President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Fair Labor Standards Act to give a policy backbone to his belief that goods that were not produced under rudimentary standards of decency should not be allowed to pollute the channels of interstate trade . ''The act is the bedrock of modern employment law . It outlawed child labor , guaranteed a minimum wage , established the official length of the workweek at 40 hours , and required overtime pay for anything more . Capping the working week encouraged employers to hire more people rather than work the ones they had to exhaustion . All this came not from the magic of market equilibrium but from federal policy .For decades afterward , Congress brought more people under the laws purview and engaged in perennial struggles to maintain or increase the minimum wage . Fifty years ago this month , John F. Kennedy signed its most important amendment , the Equal Pay Act , which guaranteed women and others equal pay for equal work .Despite this noble history , today the act faces an uncertain future , thanks to a series of disconcerting shifts in the way we think about work in America .The problem is indicative of the moral and political slipperiness of our time . A large and growing number of employers willfully classify their employees as exempt from the law by shifting their jobs , but not their pay , to administrative , executive and professional categories . Being exempt allows employers to ignore pesky things like overtime or minimum wages , since these are salaried , not hourly workers . Lawsuits over back overtime pay resulting from misclassifications have gone through the roof .If the line between exempt and nonexempt workers has become unfairly blurred , the line distinguishing employee and independent contractor has faded to near invisibility . We are moving toward the 1099 economy ,  named after the tax form provided to independent contractors , a classification that often walks the line of legality .For some workers , being a 1099er means more flexibility , creativity and control over their work . However , there are many more reluctant 1099 workers who want regular jobs but find themselves locked out of the system by employers looking for an easy way to buck their responsibility to their employees .And then there is the most infamous classification hustle : the internship . For bright , young ( and typically affluent ) interns at Americas top corporations there is no actual job , so there are no fair labor standards to apply . That means no minimum wage and no maximum hours . There is often no pay at all .A recent decision by the Federal District Court in Manhattan declaring that the hard-working interns involved in making the 2010 film Black Swan for Fox Searchlight were really employees is encouraging , and may well have long-range implications . Its a hopeful sign that we may yet be able to re-establish an idea that is as old-fashioned as it is good : work and you get paid .And yet , countercurrents persist . When Obamacare goes into effect next year , businesses that have more than 50 full-time employees will have to start offering health insurance . This could produce a scramble among small companies to reclassify enough employees so as not to have to pay for health insurance .In response , we need a new commitment from the federal government to buttress the Fair Labor Standards Act .More money for enforcement is a must . Compliance actions from the Department of Labors Division of Wages and Hours fell by over a third between 1997 and 2007 . This is partly a matter of resources : for this coming budget year , the Obama administration is seeking a modest increase of $ 15 million for enforcement of both the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Family Medical Leave Act . Thats not enough .There are several other ways to improve the act . Because its enforcement scheme relies on employees to come forward , rather than on government-initiated supervision through audits and worksite visits , protection against retaliation needs to be more robust . We can also improve the laws deterrence function , in the form of punitive damages for severe or pervasive violations .Its true that we are in the middle of a seismic shift in the way we structure our work lives . Both workers and employers want more flexibility . But that similarity of interests shouldnt mask the fact that employers will always have more power than their employees , and that its in their interests to make those employees work as long and as cheaply as possible .In Roosevelts day , the courts found most wages and hours legislation unconstitutional based on the doctrine of liberty of contract. The idea was as simple as it was pernicious : wages and hours legislation violated an individuals freedom to make an independent ( read : worse ) deal with his employer .We cant afford to drift further back to the bad old days of liberty of contract . Americans are drastically overworked and underpaid compared to workers in other advanced countries , and our workers are trapped in a rigid pattern of inequality that has ended a historic claim to being the nation of upward mobility .Roosevelt did not bother with economic arguments when it came to hours and wages . He offered a simple framework , both moral and patriotic . A self-supporting and self-respecting democracy ,  he proclaimed , can plead no justification for the existence of child labor , no economic reason for chiseling workers wages or stretching workers hours. That is as true today as it was then ."
-1	"Kimberly Lantigua , 17 , is an avid reader , but of a somewhat unusual oeuvre . Not long ago she worked her way through novels that spawned movies starring Meryl Streep , one of her favorite actresses . The Devil Wears Prada was a breeze . Sophies Choice is Kimberlys unsummited Everest .But for three weeks in July , she kept to a literary diet that focused on Plato , Aristotle , Thomas Hobbes and John Locke as she sat for several hours daily in a seminar at Columbia University titled Freedom and Citizenship in Ancient , Modern and Contemporary Thought.On the morning when I dropped by , she and 14 other high school students between their junior and senior years were listening to their professor , Roosevelt Monts , discuss Jean-Jacques Rousseaus treatise on the social contract and the balance of rights between an individual and a community .Although the summer sun was shining like a cruel taunt outside the windows , the kids paid close attention , nodding and chiming in . There was no stealthy texting on smartphones . No fidgeting that I could see .At a time when a lot of the talk about diminished social mobility in America is just that  talk , lip service , a wringing of hands rather than a springing into action  this seminar represents a bold exception , worthy of applause and emulation .Most of the teenagers in the classroom with Kimberly  and most of another 15 in a separate section of the seminar  are minorities who were referred from the Double Discovery Center , a program in Upper Manhattan that couples undergraduate mentors from Columbia with New York City kids who hope to become the first in their families with college degrees .This was the seminars sixth consecutive summer and the first in which the number of students rose to 30 from 15 . The course intends to get them ready for higher education , and that isnt unusual in and of itself . Many summer enrichment programs attempt as much .But the distinction of this one and the reason it should be replicated is that it doesnt focus on narrow disciplines , discrete skills , standardized tests . It doesnt reduce learning to metrics or cast college as a bridge to a predetermined career .It assumes that these kids , like any others , are hungry for big ideas . And it wagers that tugging them into sophisticated discussions will give them a fluency and confidence that could be the difference between merely getting to college and navigating it successfully , all the way to completion , which for poor kids is often the trickiest part of all .Monts also wants for these kids what he wants for every college student ( and what all of us should want for them as well ) . If the seminar is successful , he told me , they wind up seeing their place on a continuum that began millenniums ago , and they understand their fundamental stake in our political debate.They read the news differently ,  he said . They see themselves as political agents , able to participate.So as he toggled over the span of the seminar from the French Revolution to Obamacare , he wasnt just connecting dots for them . He was rooting them in our noble , troubled democracy , and trying to turn them into enlightened caretakers of it .For the courses duration , thanks to funding from the Teagle Foundation and the Jack Miller Center , the kids live and eat free at Columbia . For Kimberly , who typically shares a two-bedroom apartment with her mother and five siblings , that was part of the lure . Another student , Mysterie Sylla , 17 , told me that her time on campus was a reprieve from stints in foster care .For every five kids in the seminar , theres one teaching assistant , a Columbia undergraduate who will maintain contact with them over the next year and guide them through the college-application process . What a great model : Current college students who are blessed enough to be in the Ivy League extend a hand to would-be college students whose paths havent been easy .The kids who completed Montss seminar in the summer of 2013 are bound this fall for a range of schools including Syracuse , Brandeis and , in three cases , Columbia itself .Monts is the director of Columbias celebrated Core Curriculum , which requires freshmen and sophomores to dive into the Western canon . His summer seminar asks kids like Kimberly , who attends high school at the Manhattan Center for Science and Mathematics , to splash around in it .She was intimidated only briefly by the texts . Once Professor Monts walks you through them , theyre approachable ,  she told me .The proof was in her participation . I heard her pipe up repeatedly : about the meaning of liberty , about necessary checks on what she called our innate thirst for total power. Her voice was clear and strong .I bet she wrestles Sophie to the ground soon enough . And I think that college could carry her far ."
-1	"The true ideological inclinations of the Obama White House can be endlessly debated , but slightly more than halfway through this presidency I think its fair to make the following generalization : Obama has governed as a business-friendly social democrat and an aggressive social liberal , as a hawkish interventionist when intervention seems cheap and easy ( drones , missiles , etc . ) and a cautious realist when it doesnt , and as a surprisingly vigorous defender of presidential prerogatives across a variety of fronts . A few weeks ago , I characterized Obama-era liberalism as featuring an imperial presidency , a corporatist economic policy , and then a libertarian turn on almost every social issue ,  and while that line misses various nuances and complexities , as one-sentence summaries go I think its pretty good .Its also useful for understanding why the last few weeks have been so rough for this White House . Obviously theyve been difficult because scandal has piled on scandal : The resurfacing Benghazi affair , the news that the Internal Revenue Service took a disproportionate election-year interest in conservative activists , and now the revelation that the Department of Justice secretly seized two months worth of phone records for Associated Press reporters as part of a highly aggressive leak investigation . But its also because the details of the scandals raise uncomfortable questions about the particular policy synthesis that Obama has pursued  and theyre getting traction at a time when other high-profile stories , from the debate over the Oregon Medicaid study in wonkland to the trial of the late-term abortionist Kermit Gosnell over in culture-war territory , are raising similarly uncomfortably questions on other fronts .In the case of Benghazi , as Tim Carney points out , you have a story thats ultimately about an administration trying to downplay the resilience of Al Qaeda and the messiness of post-intervention Libya , lest those realities sow election-year doubts about the success of the White Houses entire light-footprint , drones-and-bombs approach to counterterrorism and the Middle East . In the case of the I.R.S . and Justice Department imbroglios , you have two stories that dont need to have direct links to the Oval Office to remind people of the kind of abuses that that imperial presidencies tend to generate . ( Its also striking that both the new Benghazi revelations and the I.R.S./DoJ scandals came hard hard on the heels of Rand Pauls filibuster , which was arguably the first moment when the Obama administration faced a significant political challenge on questions of executive overreach . )Meanwhile , whatever spin you put on the Oregon Medicaid study , it was a real-world test of the administrations signature domestic policy initiative whose results clearly didnt live up to liberal expectations , and its given skeptics of Obamacare perhaps their most statistically potent ammunition at a moment when the new health care law is about to face the test of implementation . ( Which , of course , involves new responsibilities for  the I.R.S . ) Likewise , while the implications of the Gosnell case are open for debate , its the first occasion in a while when social liberals have clearly been forced on the defensive  and the first high-profile story in Obamas entire presidency to throw his own radicalism on abortion into sharp relief .Obviously his White House faced major challenges all across its contentious first term . But it was rare for the administration to see its attempt at a new left-of-center synthesis challenged and undercut across multiple fronts at once  on foreign policy and civil liberties and domestic policy and social issues . Journalists no doubt talk too much about narratives and storylines , but they do matter , and having all of these stories in the wind at once is significant , in part , because it threatens to rewrite the publics understanding of what Obama-ism represents . The president wants to be seen , and works to be seen , as a pragmatic , data-driven steward of popular programs whos leading a wave of social progress at home while keeping us as safe from terrorists as any Republican tough guy could . But the current mix of headlines suggests a very different take on the same record  in which Obama embodies a new progressivism thats too comfortable with executive power and too eager to conduct foreign policy from 30,000 feet , too cozy with powerful interest groups and too wedded to a dysfunctional welfare state , and as far outside the mainstream on social issues as any of the right-wingers it likes to define itself against .Whether this alternative narrative actually takes hold with the public and press remains to be seen . But the last few weeks have clearly made it more credible , and an easier sell to the unconvinced , than all the slings and arrows of 2012 campaign ."
-1	"2012 : I call it the year in meh. Not the worst weve ever experienced , but nothing particularly great to say about it either . Like being a socialite , but in Tampa .I am looking forward to 2013 , however , because I love the odd-numbered years  theyre the ones without congressional elections , Olympics , World Cups or weird extra days tacked onto the calendar by so-called scientists . Odd-numbered years are chill . Theyre the 3 p.m. of years  that small sliver of time when lunch is digested and its too early to think about dinner and you stand at least a fighting chance of getting something done .In that spirit , here are the New Rules for the new year:NEW RULE Now that their end-of-the-world prophecy has proved to be complete baloney , the Mayans must be given a job predicting election results for Fox News .NEW RULE Sometime during the 2013 awards show season , Gangnam Style must be given an award for the shortest amount of time between my finding out what something is to my being completely sick of it . Besting the time of 7 hours , 12 minutes , set by The Macarena in 1996 .NEW RULE Congress must make it a tradition to drive off the fiscal cliff every year . And I mean really off the cliff , like Toonces the cat drove that car . This way Republicans can learn that lower military spending wont lead to China invading . And Democrats can learn that no one cares what the Commerce Department does anyway .NEW RULE No more mixing politics with pizza . The filthy rich founder of Papa Johns , John Schnatter , said hed cut his employees hours to avoid the costs of Obamacare . This is where Id normally suggest boycotting Papa Johns , but thats like telling people to boycott sadness . Nobody eats Papa Johns because they like it . They eat it because Dominos wont deliver to crack houses .NEW RULE The winners of next months Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show must later compete against the winners of Toddlers & Tiaras  so we can get their handlers in one place , lock the doors and let the kids and dogs run for their lives .NEW RULE The New Years Eve ball drop must be moved to one of the two states that recently legalized pot , so we can hear the crowd sing in unison , Should old acquaintance be ... what are the words again ? NEW RULE Second-term Obama must have a few laughs by acting out the Tea Partys worst fears . He must order Air Force One to fly everywhere upside-down like Denzel and replace Bo the White House dog with two pit bulls named Malcolm and X.NEW RULE Drugstores , supermarkets , department stores and all other retail establishments must stop asking me to join their club. A club is a place to have a few drinks . What youre offering me is two dollars off a bottle of NyQuil . And thats nothing like being in a club . Unless I drink the whole bottle at once .NEW RULE You cant run for president if you dont know how old the world is . Quizzed recently , Marco Rubio answered , Im not a scientist , man. As if you have to be Galileo to Google , How old is the earth ?  And when asked his thoughts on evolution , Chris Christie said , None of your business !  Which is what you say when someone asks you if you made a baby with the maid . Fellas , if you and your party want to be taken seriously , you dont have to recite the collected works of Stephen Hawking  just stop regurgitating the Facebook page of Sarah Palin .NEW RULE If we must sit through a 30-second ad to see your Web site , you have to take down all of those banner ads , which no one has clicked on since 1997 . Please  Im trying to watch a video of a nipple slip from last nights episode of Real Housewives of Atlanta. Lets not cheapen it ."
-1	"A few weeks ago , New York Magazines Jonathan Chait wrote a post that cited the work of Reason Magazines Peter Suderman as an example of how libertarian and conservative journalists have spun a cocoon around their readers , making Obamacares doom seem perpetually inevitable even as the specifics of their doomsaying tell a story of its gradual success . The message of every individual dispatch is a confident prediction of the hated enemys demise ,  Chait wrote of Sudermans writing , yet the terms described in each , taken together , tell the story of retreat.To illustrate this point about the substance , when viewed as a whole of his fellow journalists analysis , he quoted four posts Suderman wrote during the winter of Obamacares discontent , most of which were day-after analysis of new enrollment numbers , and all of which noted ( accurately ) that the program was lagging its projected enrollment levels . Then he quoted a fifth post , from July , in which Suderman took issue ( again , reasonably ) with a new study claiming that Obamacare had cut the uninsured rate by 20 million . Thus , Chait concluded , readers of Sudermans coverage have gone from learning that the law has failed to cover anybody to learning it would cover a couple million to learning it would cover a few million to learning that it has probably insured fewer than 20 million people halfway through year one.What was missing from this gloss , as Suderman noted in a slightly puzzled response , were any quotes from his writing in April , May and June , when he also covered Obamacares ( unexpected even to many of its supporters ) enrollment surge , and wrote posts explaining its implications for the uninsured rate ( and acknowledging some of his own more pessimistic hypotheticals no longer obtained ) . In other words , yes , a reader of Sudermans work might have been more pessimistic about Obamacare than was warranted  but that same reader would have had an accurate real-time sense of where the enrollment numbers stood , while a reader of Chaits take on Suderman would come away with the pretty clear ( and false ) implication that Suderman was a hack who only covered Obamacares numbers prior to its last-minute surge , and then simply dropped the subject before returning months later to attack new evidence of its success .I raise this recent example because it has some relevance to how Chait characterizes my coverage of Mitt Romneys 2012 presidential campaign in his post today on Paul Ryans new poverty-and-mobility policy blueprint . Ordinarily , Chaits piece would provide an excellent opportunity to resume our long-running , Does Paul Ryan regard The Fountainhead as a blueprint for public policy ?  debate , especially since he actually gives a little ground on that essential question . But unfortunately , that ground-giving is followed by this description of my own views on Romneys campaign strategy and policy pitch:The difficulty of separating spin from substance is highlighted by Ross Douthats latest column expressing joy and relief that the Republican Party is , at last , abandoning plutocracy . In 2012 , Douthat concedes , Republicans ran openly as the party of the rich ( job creators good , class warfare bad , you built that and now the 47 percent are living off your hard work ) . Ryans new poverty agenda is the latest evidence that they are tailoring their agenda to working class votes.The trouble is that I lived through the 2012 election , and Douthat was insisting that Republicans were not the party of the rich then , too . In early 2012 , Douthat confidently asserted that Mitt Romney was campaigning instead on a revenue-neutral tax reform and a modest tax cut for middle class investors , neither of which leaves him particularly vulnerable to the charge of giving massive tax breaks to the rich. Some of us pointed out that the math didnt add up , and that the Romney-Ryan commitment to big tax rate cuts could not be reconciled with his more populist promises . No , no , Douthat insisted , the Romney platform amounted to no net tax cut for the rich , tax relief for the middle class.Douthat , with characteristically sharp hindsight analysis , now repeats the same shorthand description of Romney-Ryan that he dismissed at the time as desperate liberal smears . With characteristic optimism , he once again sees the Party moving boldly toward the center .So here we have two quotes from my election-year commentary , one from early 2012 ,  the other undated . The early-2012 quote is from a post I wrote in the first week of January , when Romneys position on taxes was indeed roughly as I described it ; the later quote is from the day after the first presidential debate , when Romney ( in the course of an unexpectedly effective debate performance ) did indeed promise no net tax cut for the rich , tax relief for the middle class. But Chaits readers would have had a slightly clearer sense of my views had he quoted my posts actual description of that on-stage promise . I called it a pivot away from Romneys foolish commitment to maximal rate reductions ,  a reference to something significant that happened in the eight months between between my January post and the first presidential debate : Namely , in the course of fending off his more conservative challengers , Romney committed himself to a more sweeping and specific rate reduction than hed been campaigning on originally .Here is the column I wrote after he made that commitment : It is not , I think , favorable to Romney , and it concludes by warning that the likely Republican nominee is suddenly headed for the kind of political and ideological cul-de-sac that losing presidential candidates often end up occupying. Nor was that criticism isolated . I will certainly plead guilty to looking for reasons to be hopeful about Romney : We are not all as blessed as Jonathan Chait in having a political party whose current leaders views accord so exactly with our own , and some of us have to oscillate between optimism and pessimism instead , rather than resting secure in the knowledge that whatever Barack Obama does next will be almost-perfectly correct . But even mixed with attempts to give him the benefit of the doubt , the idea that Romney wasnt doing enough to reach out beyond his base  and that he could achieve such outreach with the kind of policy moves that Ive praised when figures like Ryan and Marco Rubio and Mike Lee have made them lately  was a consistent theme in my writing throughout the long hot 12 summer .See , for instance , this column on Romneys missed opportunity to draw on his own faiths communitarian tradition , or this post questioning the choice of Ryan as his running mate ( because it doesnt address Romneys most glaring policy weakness  the ( understandable ) fear among hard-strapped voters that Republican policies will benefit the rich more than the middle class ) , or this assessment of the state of play after the conventions ( which concluded by noting that swing voters , and especially blue-collar swing voters , dont just have reasons to distrust the Republican nominee personally ; they have reasons to distrust his party on policy as well ) , or this early-autumn post on the theme of What Bush Knew and Romney Didnt ( namely , that Republicans needed to explain why their policies would benefit the middle class and the working poor , rather than just lionizing entrepreneurs and businessmen ) , or this piece on what the 47 percent fiasco says about the malign influence of the Republican donor class . ( Whats more , even when I was giving Romneys outreach strategy a more positive spin it was usually hedged : He isnt targeting [ blue collar voters ] in ways that I would consider forward-looking or particularly inventive  etc . )Did I start saying more favorable things about Romneys approach after the first debate ? Yes , I did , because I felt that he had explicitly disavowed his least-plausible policy ideas that night , shifted somewhat closer to the arguments that I felt he should have been saying all along , and shown signs ( albeit perhaps a little bit too late ) of growing into the kind of leader the G.O.P . needed . And was I generally too optimistic about the Republican tickets chances in the waning weeks of the campaign ? Sure , and the next time we have a horse-race debate Chait can go ahead and ding me for it . ( This post on Obamas aura of defeat is a good place to start . )But the claim that I spent 2012 dismissing as a desperate liberal smear the idea that Romneys sales pitch offered more to the upper class than to the rest is extremely odd , given that I made that very criticism myself again and again and again . I dont expect readers to read every word Ive written ( perish the thought ) , but I do expect a frequent interlocutor like Chait , whose own work I try to give the attention it deserves , to at least acknowledge the major themes of my own commentary , rather than choosing two and only two examples to prove that I was always on board with what Team Romney was selling . Cherry-picking is the kind way of describing that kind of mischaracterization ; I can think of some harsher ones as well ."

She has 25 of the University of Pennsylvania Health Systems toughest patients . Its her job to help them set health goals and , step by step , carry them out .One of her patients is Grover Wilson , an engaging man of 56 who weighs 515 pounds . Wilson had long been athletic and sociable , the organizer of a long-running community volleyball game . But depression and an injury led him to gain weight . Now he lives in a tiny basement apartment packed floor to ceiling with boxes of his possessions , and is trapped and isolated by his weight .White has been visiting Wilson for three months . Hes lost 15 pounds during that time , with the help of a group class at the Penn Center and her visits . How are you doing on your goal to cut down on sugary drinks ?  she asks . What about your snacks ? Ive finished all my hummus and pretzels ,  he says . Im going to get some baby carrots , and more hummus , and pita chips.Thats good , thats good ,  White says . Theyre having a sale on hummus.They talk about his exercise goal : walking up and down his hallway . As usual , Im not doing a great job on my own ,  he said . Its very easy when youre alone and obese and have sleep apnea and other problems to say , I just want to give up. Depression comes and goes . But todays a good day. He means because White is visiting .Youll do it . I took half a person off me ,  White says  she accompanies another patient to the gym , and shes lost 50 pounds so far . My knees are feeling better . Youll do it . Be around positive people.They talk about his other problems . Hes on a payment plan with the power company , worried about his next payment . But then I got my S.S.I . rebate ,  he says . Now I can pay my bills.Im so happy !  White beams : Why didnt you tell me ? Wilson squeezes her hand . You dont get half , you know ,  he says , smiling .In 2010 , researchers from Penn began interviewing patients who lived in high-poverty neighborhoods about what they saw as barriers that kept them from getting health care , and kept them sick . Those responses  from long interviews with 115 patients  became the basis of the Penn Center and IMPaCT , which stands for individualized management for patient-centered targets.The centers community health workers , or C.H.W.s  seven now , but there will be 30 next year  visit some of Penn Medicines poorest and sickest patients : people who live in high-poverty neighborhoods , are hospitalized or have two chronic diseases , and either have Medicaid or no insurance at all . Since they began seeing patients in 2011 , theyve treated 1,800 of them . They expect to work with that number every year starting in 2015 .Many poor countries use C.H.W.s on an enormous scale  in rural areas , where doctors and nurses are scarce , a C.H.W . often serves as the doctor . In the United States , their role is different . White and her colleagues have no medical training . ( Before this , she was a family health worker with the Supportive Child Adult Network . ) Theyre chosen for their ability to listen , support and encourage , without judgment . They are people from the same communities as their patients , and often with the same struggles . They help patients with the many factors keeping them sick that arent typical doctor problems .This is a crucial role in a country where vast numbers of people are sick with chronic lifestyle-related diseases . Doctors cant help patients change their behavior in the 15 minutes they spend with each patient . But community health workers can .Yet C.H.W.s are few in the United States . Some promotora programs employ them in Native American and Latino communities , especially with migrant workers . A few states make them a part of health care  and Obamacare will increase that number .Every so often you see a foundation sink a lot of money into community health worker programs ,  said Prabhjot Singh , a Columbia professor and doctor in East Harlem who is co-chair of the One Million Community Health Workers Campaign . The DNA of a lot of these programs comes from an activist , almost anti-bottom-line perspective . They are grant funded , and theres a lot of academic interest but there is not a way to systematically invest in C.H.W.s. So even though many studies  this is a good compilation ( pdf )  show they improve health and save money , these programs rarely last very long or grow .The Penn Center was founded by Shreya Kangovi , an internist and pediatrician who is an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School . Before she and her colleagues designed the IMPaCT program , they reviewed other C.H.W . programs to see why they didnt last .They found several common problems . Most important , C.H.W.s were rarely integrated into a health care systems processes or its financing . They were often all by themselves , in a church basement ,  Kangovi said . If they were doing great work , no one knew about it and no one paid for it. Many programs vanished when their grant money disappeared .There were also staffing problems  lots of turnover , lots of workers who werent right for the job . Organizations didnt understand what kinds of skills they needed and how to identify the people who had them . Many C.H.W . programs were disease-specific  but a lot of patients have multiple serious illnesses . And the work wasnt standardized : Few programs had manuals , for example . Each new worker was re-inventing the job .Kangovi and her colleagues tried to attack these problems systematically . They decided that C.H.W.s wouldnt limit their scope , but help patients with any health goal . They made hiring decisions and designed a manual and formal training based on the barriers to care cited by the patients . They aimed to have a plug-and-play model that other hospitals could use .It is still early , but there are some good signs . Staff turnover has been zero . The researchers tracked the impact of having a C.H.W . visit patients at hospital discharge and for two weeks after . Patients who got the visits saw a doctor sooner , had better mental health and were less likely to later have multiple readmissions than patients in a control group . ( The program had no effect on patients physical health or medication adherence  not unexpected given such a brief intervention , ) The long-term home visits the C.H.W.s do now are aimed at improving patients chronic diseases . The center is halfway through a long study looking at that .The Penn Center is one of several new models hospitals are trying to make C.H.W . programs sustainable . ( Theres a whole other way of doing this , too  programs run by community organizations , paid for largely by cities or states . ) Another is Grand-Aides . Unlike the Penn C.H.W.s , Grand-Aides dont help with social or logistical issues . They are nurse extenders who get hundreds of hours of medical training . Each patient visit is supervised in real time by phone by a nurse , who makes all the decisions . A pilot at two pediatric Medicaid sites in Texas showed that the program cut readmissions by at least two-thirds .Arthur Garson Jr. , who directs the Health Policy Institute of the Texas Medical Center in Houston and founded Grand-Aides , believes that C.H.W . programs have stayed small because most dont certify their workers . His program requires each Grand-Aide to pass a test for certification every year . Its a way of standardizing the work and building confidence with hospitals . Hospitals want to know they are competent and tested yearly ,  he said . Currently 14 hospitals in the United States use Grand-Aides  Garson says the program will be in 40 hospitals by spring 2015 .Do hospitals make money from C.H.W . programs ? Some believe they do . Garry L. Scheib , the chief operating officer of the University of Pennsylvania Health System , said that Penn had a financial as well as a medical interest in putting the C.H.W . program in its budget and tripling its size .The real economic benefit for us is the open beds it creates ,  he said . I usually have a waiting list for inpatient beds. Hospitals profit most by filling those beds with patients who need complex , specialty surgeries and care  especially when they carry private insurance . IMPaCT patients , by contrast , often need routine care , or non-medical help . They carry Medicaid ( which brings in little revenue ) or are uninsured ( a total loss ) . Hospitals must accept these patients , so keeping them as healthy as possible  preferably outside the hospital  is good .Scheib said IMPaCT also saves Penn money because its staffers are a low-wage way ( their pay starts at $ 14 an hour ) to stretch and complement doctors and nurses who are paid a lot more .But Singh warns that only a minority of hospitals are solvent enough to see things the way Penn does . Most have huge reservations about bringing on yet another work force , along with care managers and care coordinators . And providers dont really have great incentives to reach out to Medicare and Medicaid patients that are hard to reach . If these patients dont come to an appointment , well , thats just how it goes . Maybe the hospitals internal quality indicators go down a little  but it doesnt warrant pounding the pavement to find these people.Given the rarity of C.H.W . programs , this is obviously how many hospitals think . The emergency room is still a profit center for many hospitals , as long as patients have some insurance .Hospitals are also resistant because C.H.W . programs lie outside their core competency . If its community health workers or nurses , theyll always go with nurses . Its easier  even if theres a sizeable population nurses are unable to reach ,  said Heidi Behforouz , an associate physician in the global health equity division at Brigham and Womens Hospital in Boston . ( She ran Partners In Healths PACT program , perhaps the most renowned C.H.W . program in the United States . Even that program didnt survive the loss of charitable funding  it was transferred to another organization , in much diminished form . ) Not a lot of places have glommed on to Yes , we need the community health worker model. Obamacare is changing this calculus . Medicare now bases a small part of its reimbursement to hospitals on measures of quality , including readmissions  which gives hospitals an incentive to help patients stay healthy . In a major shift for C.H.W.s , the federal government this year permitted state Medicaid funds to pay for their work , as long as it was initially recommended by a doctor or other licensed practitioner .But the biggest change initiated by the Affordable Care Act is a gradual shift away from fee-for-service medicine to rewarding quality , not quantity . With that shift , hospitals and payers will be looking for what Singh calls the lightweight infrastructure that takes care of people outside of the hospital.If fee-for-service disappears , there is more emphasis on prevention , wellness and quality of life in the long term ,  said Behforouz , Then everybody would be pushing for community-based models that kept people at home.Join Fixes on Facebook and follow updates on twitter.com/nytimesfixes .

-1	"I encourage you to read Facing the Climate Crisis without Hysteria ,  the latest Huffington Post piece by Steven A. Cohen , who is the executive director of Columbia Universitys Earth Institute and whose career , including long stints at the Environmental Protection Agency , has given him an excellent vantage point on the mix of regulation , motivation , prosperity and innovation that drives environmental progress .The piece appropriately decries caricatured , baseless attacks on climate science by conservative ideologues and those seeking to delay a shift away from fossil fuels . But Cohen also criticizes climate campaigners and some in the media for responding with oversimplified predictions of environmental doom . Heres an excerpt and link , with some more background on Cohen:I think the questioning of science by the American right wing and the political assaults funded by their rich benefactors are proving to be a distraction to those interested in moving the planet to a path of sustainable economic growth . It is turning analysts into advocates and advocates into hysterics . The IPCC report focused a great deal of attention on solutions , but the media accounts of the report focused on the possibility of food shortages . Here we go again : Chicken Littles sky is falling in . Climate and ecological impacts are creating deep problems in agriculture . While there is no question that these are real problems , as in the past these will likely be addressed by new technologies and new techniques that will overcome the problems we now face .The glass is either half empty or half full . I choose to believe it is half full . The history of the technological age we are in is that technology both creates unforeseen problems and then sets about solving them . My bet is on human ingenuity . Maybe the U.S. federal government was not capable of building a website to handle the traffic generated by the Obamacare deadline , but Amazons website copes pretty well with the massive traffic it generates in the days before Christmas . Maybe we cant stop the sea waters from rising , but we can place our utility rooms on the second floor instead of the basement . As for agriculture and the food supply , it is always a bad idea to bet against the technology of food production .I suspect we will survive , because we are not suicidal .He goes on to make a vital point about the down sides of an overemphasis on technological solutions ( a theme I touched on a few years ago ) :How far down the road to an all-technological world have we travelled and how far do we want to go ? Think about the holographic recreational facilities on the science fiction spacecraft in Star Trek . What if that was all we had left and , in our carelessness , had destroyed our home planet ?The issue we face is not our survival , but our willingness to accept the final triumph of technology at the expense of the planet we are biologically and emotionally connected to .Heres the link to the full post . This echoes the cautionary views of the Harvard biologist Edward O. Wilson , as well .Like many , Im sure , Ive been much more familiar with the climate and energy policy preferences of Jeffrey Sachs , the institutes director . The best recent representation of Sachss views is the paper he and others co-authored with James E. Hansen , the longtime NASA climate scientist who now has a climate policy position at Columbia , in which they build on Hansens longstanding call for a rising price on carbon .To capture the full scope of thinking on this question , I think its important to consider Cohens ideas , too .He stated flatly at a recent meeting on climate science and policy at the University of California , Santa Cruz , that the primacy of energy demands in developing countries will prevent a carbon price from working to cut the carbon from global energy menus any time soon . This will not happen through a carbon tax or anything that increases the price of energy ,  Cohen said . The developing world sees what we have here . If we dont leapfrog were in deep trouble. He went on to stress the importance of government policies that can drive the development and dissemination of low-carbon energy technologies .Heres a recent talk Cohen gave on approaching sustainable human development as a management problem ( the core of the talk begins at 4 minutes , 30 seconds ) :You can follow Sachs and Cohen on Twitter here : @ JeffDSachs @ StevenACohen ."
-1	"Jonathan Gruber is mad as hell , and hes not going to take it anymore . The eminent health care economist and health reform architect is annoyed at Casey Mulligans latest , which misrepresents Grubers views ; mine too .Gruber is right to be mad : that was a disgraceful , deceptive column . But I think you also want to put it into a larger picture : the enduring myth of the stupid progressive economist .So about Mulligan : As Gruber documents , he pulls multiple fast ones , asserting things that he says are conclusions of the CBO report when they arent  theyre his own views , pulled out of , um , thin air , or maybe someplace else , which he is projecting onto the budget office to make them seem authoritative .Beyond that , Mulligan tells his readers that both Gruber and I are too dumb or craven to admit that the disincentives to work created by some aspects of the Affordable Care Act impose economic costs . One suspects that Mulligan didnt actually read either of the pieces he links to . If he had , he would have found this from Gruber:But the likelihood of voluntary reductions in work is not the only issue . The CBO also projects work reduction by individuals who cut back on hours or avoid moving up the job ladder because they dont want to lose Medicaid eligibility , or because they dont want to make so much in wages that they would lose tax credits to help pay insurance premiums . Unlike voluntary job leaving , this second kind of work reduction would entail real economic distortions and be a cost , not a benefit .And this from me:Just to be clear , the predicted long-run fall in working hours isnt entirely a good thing . Workers who choose to spend more time with their families will gain , but theyll also impose some burden on the rest of society , for example , by paying less in payroll and income taxes . So there is some cost to Obamacare over and above the insurance subsidies . Any attempt to do the math , however , suggests that were talking about fairly minor costs , not the devastating effects Mr. Cantor asserted in his next post on Twitter .So both of us acknowledge that there are incentive effects and that they have a cost ; but both of us argue on quantitative grounds that the cost isnt large . Hardly the doctrinaire liberalism Mulligan thinks he sees .Oh , and bonus misrepresentation : Mulligan:Paul Krugman goes even further and calls it misrepresentations to interpret the marginal tax rate provisions of the Affordable Care Act as destructive .No , I didnt  I called talk about 2 million jobs destroyed a misrepresentation , because it is . Who says so ? The CBO itself .On to the broader point . What one sees in this particular Mulligan piece is something I encounter all the time , in many contexts : the myth of the stupid progressive economist .It works like this : Conservatives in general , and conservative economists in particular , often have a very narrow vision of what economics is all about  namely supply , demand , and incentives . Anything that interferes with the sacred functioning of markets or reduces the incentive to produce must be a bad thing ; any time a progressive economist supports policies that dont fit neatly into this orthodoxy , it must be because he doesnt understand Econ 101 . And conservative economists are so sure of this that they cant be bothered to actually read what the progressives write  at the first hint of deviation from laissez-faire , they stop paying attention and begin debating with the stupid progressive in their mind , not the real economist out there .As a result , many conservatives seem utterly unable to take on board the notion that people like Jon Gruber or yours truly might understand Econ 101 , but also believe with good reason that you need to go beyond that point .On the health care issue : yes , there are incentive effects  as there are with all insurance , by the way . But theres also good reason to believe that theres a major market imperfection in the form of job lock , and that even aside from this , there are important benefits to expanding health insurance that must be weighed against any costs . All of that is , in brief , in both of the pieces Mulligan denounces , and there at much greater length in our other writings ; but as so often happens , conservatives develop problems of reading comprehension whenever such issues come up .Ive encountered similar responses on many other issues . You say that deficit spending is helpful in a depressed economy ? You must be saying that deficits and bigger government are always good , which is stupid hahaha . You say that increasing unemployment benefits in a demand-constrained economy can create jobs ? But you also said once upon a time that unemployment insurance can raise the natural rate of unemployment , so youre stupid hahaha .Well , somebodys being stupid , anyway .I cant resist going back to the 2009 debate over stimulus , when one after another , prominent conservative economists dismissed calls for a temporary increase in spending as being clearly stupid and/or corrupt , because accounting identities , or maybe the effect of expected future taxes , clearly showed that stimulus made no sense . Along the way these notables reinvented classic conceptual errors from 80 years ago and added a few new howlers too ; yet their faith in the proposition that progressive economists must be idiots never wavered .But then John Stuart Mill knew all about this ."
-1	"In the wake of the Times Magazines profile this weekend of les reformocons , both Jonathan Chait and Danny Vinik have noted what Chait calls the near-total absence of Paul Ryans name from a story that concerns itself with the kind of wonkery that has long defined the House Budget Chairmans brand . Chait suggests that this reflects a shift away from Ryan-style apocalypticism on fiscal issues among right-of-center policy entrepreneurs . Vinik , meanwhile , argues that a split between Ryan and reform conservatives over taxes might be in the offing , since the former veep nominee is more likely to side with a WSJ-style always cut the top rate vision than with proponents of something like Mike Lees family-friendly approach .I think both writers raise useful points , but also possibly exaggerate the discontinuity between Ryanism and the reformist tendency . Chait and I have gone so many rounds on the True Nature of Paul Ryan over the years that I dont think its worth re-litigating those issues ; Ill just say that from the point of view of conservative reformers , the Ryan who matters ( and yes , like all politicians he contains multitudes ) has always been the Ryan who did more than any other Obama-era politician to save the G.O.P . from policy unseriousness ( and often tried to do still more ) , rather than a Randian Ryan or an apocalyptic Ryan or any other interpretation of his record Chait prefers . And in this sense , many aspects of Ryanism are pretty clearly foundational for reformers : The wisdom of his basic vision for Medicare reform is taken for granted by most people in our camp ( and , happily , by most prominent Republicans ) , his 2009 alternative to Obamacare , which failed to win over the party at the time , looks a lot like the health care alternative proposed in the recent Room to Grow compendium , and the broad goal of his famous budgets  reforming the welfare state in order to keep the federal governments share of the economy within its post-World War II bounds  is a broad reformocon goal as well .That said , reformers ( well , this one , at least , but I think most of us ) tend to differ from the Ryan budgets vision on two important fronts . First , its projected cuts to discretionary spending and Medicaid look implausibly sweeping , and as a result  to quote from my very first column on the Ryan blueprint  too much of the budgets austerity is borne by downscale Americans ,  without any of the compensating efforts aimed at shoring up the working classs socioeconomic position that many reformers consider essential to our project . Second , and relatedly , the Ryan sketch ( and in fairness , it is just a sketch ) of tax reform seems to strongly prioritize top-rate reductions , and reformocons tend to prefer tax plans that include elements ( a child tax credit , a payroll tax cut , or at the very least  as in Dave Camps plan  just a larger tax cut for median-income households ) aimed much more squarely at raising the average workers take-home pay .Now without claiming special knowledge , my sense is that Ryan himself might accept some of the merits of the first critique , and that his budgets implausible discretionary cuts were mostly driven by the political imperative to 1 ) meet the House conservative demand for a balanced budget as soon as humanly possible ( in ten  no , five years ! ) without 2 ) including any kind of Social Security overhaul . While there isnt ( yet ) a Ryan blueprint specifically focused on safety-net reform , if you look at some of his post-2012 forays on the issue , you can see the outline ( in this op-ed , for instance ) of a more plausible approach , in which the focus is on reshaping anti-poverty programs rather than just slashing them to achieve unlikely spending targets .On the second front , though , I think ( having made a similar argument myself in the past ) that Viniks probably correct to see Ryan as more of a traditional supply-sider on taxes  which is not surprising , given his intellectual influences  than a potential partisan of a family-friendly tax reform . ( One could add , as well , that hes also a WSJ-style immigration dove and monetary hawk , both positions that put him somewhat at odds with , for instance , Ramesh Ponnuru and Reihan Salam , among other reformist writers . ) So if and when there is a Ryan tax reform proposal , I wouldnt be surprised to see some critiques from the reformocon camp , and if there were ever a Ryan presidential run those kind of disagreements might loom larger . Or  who knows ?  perhaps the recent debate between Kim Strassel and Ponnuru will be recapitulated some day in a behind-the-scenes policy argument between a Ways and Means chairman Ryan and a President Rubio or Lee But thats getting a long way ahead of ourselves . For now , I would say that the differences between reform conservatism and Ryanism are more implicit than definite , and to the extent that they might come to matter in the future , they would represent a far , far more fruitful variety of intra-conservative disagreement than most of the G.O.P.s Obama-era civil wars ."
-1	"WASHINGTON  MORE than two million people have signed up for health insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act , a tribute to the effectiveness of the tech surge the Obama administration deployed to overcome the highly publicized problems with HealthCare.gov that emerged in October . The websites initial rollout will long stand as a monument to how badly technology contracting can go wrong . But the remarkable recovery also demonstrates what a determined response to such bungling can achieve .Sadly , food stamp and Medicaid recipients can only look on in envy . Just as disaster-relief agencies keep track of hurricanes , floods and earthquakes , students of anti-poverty programs remember a litany of automation and contracting meltdowns  some of them prolonged , even epic . Florida , 1992-93 . Michigan , 1998-99 . Colorado , 1998-2002 . Texas , 2006-7 . Indiana , 2007-9 . The Colorado Benefits Management System is particularly memorable : When first implemented , it reportedly refused food stamps to anyone who did not have a drivers license from Guam .But finding parallels to the HealthCare.gov meltdown requires no memory at all . Just as HealthCare.gov was filling the headlines , a contractor for the Georgia Department of Human Services was neglecting to send renewal notices to the homes of some 66,000 food stamp recipients and about half that number of Medicaid beneficiaries . On Nov. 1 , the states computer system  which goes by the Orwellian acronym Success  automatically terminated benefits to all those affected for failure to cooperate with reviews they had never been told were underway .In December , a Massachusetts contractor sent thousands of people new electronic food stamp benefit cards and immediately deactivated their old cards  without waiting to see if the new ones had arrived in the mail . Many had not . In mid-October , a contractors glitch made food stamps inaccessible to recipients in 17 states .The White House showed impressive alacrity in fixing HealthCare.gov . But its response to technology failures affecting low-income people has been far more sluggish . The federal Department of Health and Human Services did eventually direct Georgia to reactivate the Medicaid benefits for those wrongfully terminated . The federal Department of Agriculture ( which administers food stamps , now known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program ) brushed aside repeated pleas to tell Georgia to reinstate food assistance in time for Thanksgiving .Instead , Georgia told its desperate people to reapply through a website , though it operated only intermittently . Wrongfully terminated households could call to request paper applications  but the call center answered fewer than 30 percent of the calls it received in September , and the lucky few who did get through had average waiting times of 34 minutes . They could go into a local food stamp office  but once there , they would only be directed to a terminal to try to get on the website or a phone to try to get through to the call center . Not just Orwell , but Kafka and Dickens come to mind .Nor was this latest failure an isolated episode . In July 2012 , a group of Atlanta eligibility workers told the federal Agriculture Department that case managers were falsely documenting that they were calling customers and getting no answer and using that excuse to justify denial of food-stamp assistance .The Agriculture Department did not investigate these whistle-blowers complaints . When my name appeared in an Atlanta news article about the food stamp debacle , a state employee called me to report a backlog of 12,000 applications waiting to be entered into the Success database .All of this reflects a broader double standard for automation and contracting  and for government administration generally . An Indiana state judge described a familiar pattern in an earlier food stamp and Medicaid automation contracting fiasco : Officials implemented a supersized contract , an untested theoretical experiment ,  that resulted in irremediable personal suffering of needy Hoosiers.A few years ago , a former federal official , frustrated at frequent indifference to low-income Medicaid beneficiaries , joked darkly that the two big government health insurance programs should be called Med-I-Care and Med-I-Dont-Care. ( Elderly Medicare users are politically far more important than the poor and disabled customers of Medicaid . )Properly supervised contractors can use technology to improve the delivery of government services . But attention , oversight and willingness to act decisively to remedy fiascoes seem to depend on the wealth and clout of those who are affected . As Obamacare regains its footing , that lesson shouldnt be forgotten ."
-1	"Hillary Clinton of all people knows how political fortunes turn on a dime . But she must be puzzled nonetheless , and spooked , that over a six-month period when she made no big news whatsoever , her popularity took a double-digit tumble .A poll released last week by NBC News and The Wall Street Journal charted the decline . It found that the percentage of Americans who view her favorably had dropped to 46 from 56 . The percentage with unfavorable views had risen , less strikingly , to 33 from 29 .Here we go . The beginning of the end of her inevitability .Its about time , because the truth , more apparent with each day , is that she has serious problems as a potential 2016 presidential contender , and the premature cheerleading of Chuck Schumer and other Democrats wont change that .In the wake of the federal shutdown , in the midst of the Obamacare meltdown , voter disgust with business as usual is at the kind of peak that ensures more than the usual share of surprises in the next few elections . In one recent poll , 60 percent of Americans said that theyd like to see everyone in Congress , including their own representatives , replaced ; in another , a similar majority hankered for a third party .These unusually big numbers suggest a climate in which someone who has been front and center in politics for nearly a quarter-century wont make all that many hearts beat all that much faster . Voters are souring on familiar political operators , especially those in , or associated with , Washington . Thats why Clinton has fallen . Shes lumped together with President Obama , with congressional leaders , with the whole reviled lot of them .And some of the ways in which she stands out from the lot arent flattering . She comes with a more tangled political history of gifts bestowed , favors owed , ironclad allegiances and ancient feuds than almost any possible competitor does . Weve had frequent reminders of that : in the Anthony Weiner saga ; in reports of mismanagement at the Clinton Foundation ; in coverage of Terry McAuliffes bid to become Virginias governor .Weve also had glimpses of the Clintons as an entrenched , entitled ruling class . To a degree that has turned off even some of the couples loyalists , Bill and Hillary have been unabashed lately in their coronation of Chelsea as the Clinton in waiting , the heir to the throne .They renamed the familys foundation to give her billing equal to theirs , with Hillary telling New York magazine that Chelseas elevation was in the DNA. They tug Chelsea onto pedestal after pedestal , tucking her into the folds of their own glory .And it works . In an interview in September , Piers Morgan asked Bill Clinton whether Hillary or Chelsea would make the better president .Over the long run , Chelsea ,  Bill said . She knows more than we do about everything.Such dynastic musings square oddly with whats shaping up as an anti-establishment passage of American politics , and the Clintons overexposure is a dicey fit for the revved-up metabolism of the Twitter era , which wants next , more , new .Hillarys shot at shattering the ultimate glass ceiling , an overdue milestone , might be newness enough . But would she be spared a potentially disruptive challenger from the left in the Democratic primaries ? The ascent of Bill de Blasio and the cult fervor for Elizabeth Warren demonstrate an appetite right now for liberal firebrands .And what would the argument for a Hillary presidency be ? Something interesting happens when you ask Democrats why her in 2016 . They say that its time for a woman , that shell raise oodles of dough , that other potentially strong candidates wont dare take her on . The answers are about the process more than the person or any vision she has for the country . Theres no poetry in them . Thats not good .Competence ,  said one prominent Democratic strategist , articulating Hillarys promise . And by the end of Obamas second term , that may be more than enough.She sailed high as secretary of state because , apart from Benghazi , she could and did position herself mostly above the partisan fray . The hellcat had become a cool cat , wearing shades instead of thick glasses , the meme of all memes .But nine months since she left that job , its hard to pinpoint what , other than all those dutiful miles she logged , her legacy is . She has returned to her earth , and its a fickle place .One of the widely circulated nuggets from the just-published book Double Down : Game Change 2012 is that Obamas advisers considered knocking Joe Biden off the ticket and putting Hillary on . The anecdote has been cast as an insult to Biden .But he remained , because internal research apparently suggested that Obama wouldnt get a meaningful bump from the swap .What does that say about Hillary ?"
-1	"TORONTO  For democracies to work , politicians need to respect the difference between an enemy and an adversary .An adversary is someone you want to defeat . An enemy is someone you have to destroy . With adversaries , compromise is honorable : Todays adversary could be tomorrows ally . With enemies , on the other hand , compromise is appeasement .Between adversaries , trust is possible . They will beat you if they can , but they will accept the verdict of a fair fight . This , and a willingness to play by the rules , is what good-faith democracy demands .Between enemies , trust is impossible . They do not play by the rules ( or if they do , only as a means to an end ) and if they win , they will try to rewrite the rules , so that they can never be beaten again .Adversaries can easily turn into enemies . If majority parties never let minority parties come away with half a loaf , the losers are bound to conclude they can only win through the utter destruction of the majority .Once adversaries think of democracy as a zero-sum game , the next step is to conceive of politics as war : no quarter given , no prisoners taken , no mercy shown .For a long time now , the language used by both sides in American politics has been inflamed by bellicose metaphors . Elected officials tear into their opponents , take the fight to their opponent and engage  as we see clearly now , in the third week of the federal government shutdown  in the tactical equivalent of trench warfare . Where language leads , conduct follows .The problem is that politics is not war , but the only reliable alternative to it . Once we think of politics as war , battle cries drown out democratic persuasion . By slow degrees , belligerence and self-righteousness make cooperation impossible .There can not be much doubt that , in the impasse over the shutdown in Washington , and in the possibility of a default on the federal debt , we are seeing what happens when a politics of enemies supplants a politics of adversaries .Anyone who has lived in a dysfunctional or struggling democracy knows that a politics of enmity can end in rule by presidential decree , or even in political violence . Americans consider such scenarios unthinkable . Yet even if the standoff over the debt ceiling ends in a deal , it will already have exacted a brutal price . Extremists will come away believing that hostage-taking might work next time . When blackmail becomes standard practice , democracy is pulled a step closer to permanent paralysis .Some experts believe that the enmity mind-set simply reflects real divisions in the society at large . Inequalities in income , wealth and opportunity have soared , the argument goes , making it impossible for ordinary Americans to respect each other as adversaries .Other thoughtful observers argue  I think convincingly  that while factions at either end of the political spectrum do see each other as enemies , most Americans are actually not as divided as their politics makes them seem . The real problem , in this account , is the political system : districts drawn so that incumbents never face the challenge of reaching out beyond their own base ; primary systems that reward extremist activists over moderate pragmatists ; campaign finance rules that allow big , opaque donations by wealthy interests .From this perspective , the politicians arent so much reflecting the divisions in American society as they are exacerbating them , from the top down .The tendency is to magnify differences of policy into differences of conviction . For example , Republican and Democrat voters alike are ever more dependent on government programs like Social Security and Medicare , but you would never know this from the way Tea Party Republicans describe Obamacare as an assault on freedom .Politicians ratchet up manageable differences of policy into conflicts over identity and value . In this way , what Freud called the narcissism of minor differences drives party activists into closed worlds of discourse , while leaving the rest of Americans feeling that the system fails to serve them at all . They cease participating altogether , leaving the politicians to brawl in a deserted public square .Besides magnifying differences , the politics of enmity makes competition viscerally personal . The object is not to rebut what people say , but to deny them the right to be heard at all . Attack ads that deny standing have been a feature of American politics from Lyndon B. Johnsons depiction of Barry M. Goldwater as mentally unstable menace to the swift boating of John F. Kerry . The politics of personal destruction have come to seem normal , even acceptable .More civility and gentility  being nicer  will not cure this . What needs to change are the institutions themselves , and they will only change when the political class in Washington realizes that , just as in American football , there are some hits that are killing the game .Saving the game means changing the rules . Until quite recently Americans believed their democracy was so exceptional that they had nothing to learn from other countries . Now , real dysfunction may make them look more carefully at how other democracies avoid gridlock . Britain , France and Germany , as well as Canada and Australia , have impartial districting commissions that prevent gerrymandering and force incumbents to reach out rather than play solely to their base . They have campaign finance rules that prevent rich cranks from funding rabid partisanship . They have rules to prevent politicians from grandstanding abuse of process in their legislatures . They have open primaries that prevent electoral capture by fanatics . If Americans still feel that other countries democratic practices have nothing to teach them , they can learn from reform at the state and local level .Whats indefensible is a political class that believes nothing better is possible  a class that benefits from enmity without realizing that the damage from it is corrosive , and possibly irreversible .Michael Ignatieff , a former leader of the Liberal Party of Canada , is the author , most recently , of Fire and Ashes : Success and Failure in Politics.INTERNATIONAL NEW YORK TIMES"
-1	"Warren , Conn .WHEN I was asked to direct One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest ,  my friends warned me not to go anywhere near it .The story is so American , they argued , that I , an immigrant fresh off the boat , could not do it justice . They were surprised when I explained why I wanted to make the film . To me it was not just literature but real life , the life I lived in Czechoslovakia from my birth in 1932 until 1968 . The Communist Party was my Nurse Ratched , telling me what I could and could not do ; what I was or was not allowed to say ; where I was and was not allowed to go ; even who I was and was not .Now , years later , I hear the word socialist being tossed around by the likes of Rick Perry , Newt Gingrich , Rick Santorum , Sean Hannity , Rush Limbaugh and others . President Obama , they warn , is a socialist . The critics cry , Obamacare is socialism !  They falsely equate Western European-style socialism , and its government provision of social insurance and health care , with Marxist-Leninist totalitarianism . It offends me , and cheapens the experience of millions who lived , and continue to live , under brutal forms of socialism .My sister-in-laws father , Jan Kunasek , lived in Czechoslovakia all his life . He was a middle-class man who ran a tiny inn in a tiny village . One winter night in 1972 , during a blizzard , a man , soaked to the bone , awakened him at 2 in the morning . The man looked destitute and , while asking for shelter , couldnt stop cursing the Communists . Taking pity , the elderly Mr. Kunasek put him up for the night .A couple of hours later , Mr. Kunasek was awakened again , this time by three plainclothes policemen . He was arrested , accused of sheltering a terrorist and sentenced to several years of hard labor in uranium mines . The state seized his property . When he was finally released , ill and penniless , he died within a few weeks . Years later we learned that the night visitor had been working for the police . According to the Communists , Mr. Kunasek was a class enemy and deserved to be punished .I found myself in an equally absurd , but less depressing , situation when I was moonlighting on Czech TV as a moderator , introducing movies , in the early 50s . It was live , so there was no chance to bleep politically undesirable words . Every utterance , even in supposedly spontaneous interviews , had to be scripted , approved by the censors , learned by heart and repeated verbatim on the air .When I was preparing to interview one Comrade Homola , a powerful Communist , I sent him questions , but didnt receive his answers . My boss , also a powerful party member , told me : He is lazy ! Write his answers for him , and remind him to learn them by heart. So I did .Comrade Homola arrived at the last moment . When the red light went on and I asked the first question , he reached into his pocket , took out my answers and started to read them , awkwardly and obediently  including my inadvertent grammatical mistakes . And thus , to my consternation , went the whole interview . In the control booth , my boss hit the roof . I was fired the next day for ridiculing a representative of the state .Whatever his faults , I dont see much of a socialist in Mr. Obama or , thankfully , signs of that system in this great nation . Mr. Obama is accused of trying to expand the reach of government  into health care , financial regulation , the auto industry and so on . Its fair to question whether the federal government should have expanded powers : America , to its credit , has debated this since its birth . But lets be clear about how frightening socialism actually could be .Marx believed that we could wipe out social inequities and Lenin tested those ideas on the Soviet Union . It was his dream to create a classless society . But reality set in , as it always does . And the results were devastating . Blood flowed through Russias streets . The Soviet elite usurped all privileges ; sycophants were allowed some and the plebes none . The entire Eastern bloc , including Czechoslovakia , followed miserably .Im not sure Americans today appreciate quite how predatory socialism was . It was not  as Mr. Obamas detractors suggest  merely a government so centralized and bloated that it hobbled private enterprise : it was a spoils system that killed off everything , all in the name of social justice.What we need is not to strive for a perfect social justice  which never existed and never will  but for social harmony . Harmony in music is , by its nature , exhilarating and soothing . In an orchestra , the different players and instruments perform together , in support of an overall melody .Today , our democracy , a miraculous gathering of diverse players , desperately needs such unity . If all participants play fair and strive for the common good , we can achieve a harmony that eluded the doctrinaire socialist projects . But if just one section , or even one player , is out of tune , the music will disintegrate into cacophony .I am not asking Mr. Obama and the Republican leaders to stop playing instruments of their choosing . All I am asking is that every player keep in mind the noble melody of our country . Otherwise the noisy dissonance might become loud enough to wake another Marx , or even worse ."
-1	"WashingtonTHE latest budget proposal by Representative Paul D. Ryan , called The Path to Prosperity ,  is anything but . It fails to seriously address runaway government spending , the most pressing problem facing our nation . I can not vote for something that would trick the American people into thinking that Congress is fixing Washingtons spending problem , when in actuality wed just be allowing it to continue without end .Supporters of the Path to Prosperity ,  including many of my fellow Republicans , say that we have to stop spending money we dont have , an idea I promote every chance I get . But under the proposal by Mr. Ryan of Wisconsin , the chairman of the House Budget Committee , the federal government would continue to spend more than it will this year .Spending would grow by an average of 3.4 percent annually , only slightly less than the rate under President Obamas plan , which is 5 percent a year . After 10 years  Mr. Ryans target for eliminating the deficit  the Path to Prosperity will have spent $ 41 trillion , when the presidents plan would allow spending of $ 46 trillion . My partys de facto position has become were increasing spending , but not as much as the other guy. Thats not good enough .Just reducing growth in spending does almost nothing . We have to dig deeper and make profound cuts now . We can not continue to assume that future Congresses will do our dirty work for us .We ought to get rid of certain federal departments and agencies , stopping only to shift the role of governing back to the states , where it belongs . The Departments of Education and Energy , for example , are two bloated bureaucracies that we dont need ; their core functions would be absorbed by the states through block grants , saving taxpayers at least $ 500 billion over the next decade .Constitutionally speaking , the federal government should not have a role in K-12 public education anyway . Overpaid Washington bureaucrats shouldnt be deciding how to provide for teachers and students , whose own state and local governments are better equipped to understand their needs . A Heritage Foundation study showed that in 2010 , the average salary of an Education Department employee reached $ 103,000  nearly double the average public-school teachers salary . Lets phase out a large portion of the departments roughly $ 70 billion budget . We can transfer the remaining dollars directly to the states , where they will be used more wisely .Lets also abolish the Energy Department , which is one of the biggest federal culprits responsible for the mismanagement of taxpayer dollars . Without unending government backing , the Energy Department would have ceased to exist long ago because of its ineffectiveness , corruption and poor investment strategy . Taxpayers are now on the hook for hundreds of millions of squandered dollars because of failed federal loans given to green companies like Solyndra and Fisker Automotive .The only constitutionally necessary service provided by the Energy Department is regulation of the nations stockpile of atomic weapons , a function that can return to the Department of Defense . Eliminating this bureaucracy would be a large , permanent spending cut , and restore energy-related venture capitalism to its natural home , the private sector .Our spending crisis is so severe that we cant stop at these two departments  there are more areas to cut . For example , we should also phase out the federal highway financing system and allow states to keep their own gas tax receipts . States would then be free to determine their own transportation needs and explore creative funding for roads like public-private partnerships .As a family doctor for more than 30 years , I understand that we must look for savings in our health care system too . I recently co-sponsored legislation that would convert Medicaid and the Childrens Health Insurance Program into state-managed programs through a single federal block grant . This would save approximately $ 2 trillion over 10 years by capping federal funding at 2012 levels for the next 10 years and giving states an incentive to seek out and eliminate waste , fraud and abuse . The government agency closest to the consumer can most efficiently manage taxpayer dollars .Were not done . We must repeal Obamacare  including the associated taxes , which the Ryan budget leaves intact by assuming the enactment of tax reform later on . Well replace it with a market-based health care system devoid of government involvement and managed by patients and their doctors , a plan I have described in my Patient Option Act .If we get government out of the way and put Medicare in patients hands by increasing contribution limits to health savings accounts , it will transform Medicare into a more flexible premium assistance program .To cap all this off  literally  I have proposed a balanced-budget amendment that would force Congress to stick to the principle of not spending more than we take in . Passing a constitutional amendment is no easy task . While its a large undertaking , Ill continue to fight for its passage . Just a few weeks ago , the House put enough pressure on the Senate to force it to produce a budget  something Senator Harry Reid of Nevada , the Democratic majority leader , hadnt attempted in over four years . If we keep up the pressure , well continue to see results .Rather than nibbling around the edges as the Ryan proposal does , we must do all of this and much more now . There is a Path to Prosperity ,  but Mr. Ryans budget isnt it . The only way to protect our nations financial future as well as our citizens liberty is to stop the outrageous spending in Washington and permanently reduce the size of our overreaching federal government ."
-1	"HANOVER , N.H.  A COUPLE of months ago , JAMA Internal Medicine , a journal of the American Medical Association , published the findings of a brief online survey of middle-aged Americans.Most had previously been screened for either breast or prostate cancer . But the study found that about half said they would not choose to start screening if the test resulted in more than one overtreated person per one cancer death averted .Wow . That implies that millions of Americans might choose not to be screened if they knew the whole story  that overtreatment is typically more common than avoiding a cancer death .Is the survey right ? Honestly , I have no idea . Different surveys get different answers . According to surveys , most of us hate Obamacare . But a number of us like the Affordable Care Act ( another name for the same thing ) . And most of us like the bulk of the individual components of the law . How you ask the question matters .Similarly , how Americans feel about screening is obviously related to what they are told about screening . Most of the time they get a simple message : Its the most important thing they can do to stay healthy . Occasionally , they may hear just the opposite : Its dangerous . The truth is , its neither .Instead , its a close call . Different people in the same situation can rationally make different choices . But first , patients need some quantification of the benefits and harms .In a study to be published Monday , Dec. 30 in JAMA Internal Medicine , a colleague and I attempt to provide that data for women making the choice about screening mammography . Lets be clear at the outset : There is a lot of uncertainty  and professional disagreement  about what the data are . So we provide a range of estimates , from optimistic to pessimistic .There is no doubt that screening mammography in the United States leads to a lot of false alarms . Among a thousand 50-year-old American women screened annually for a decade , how many will have at least one false alarm ? Our estimate ranges from 490 to 670 . The data come from the mammographers themselves  the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium  and reflect radiologists who deliver low and high rates of false alarms ( those in the 25th and 75th percentiles ) .A screening program that falsely alarms about half the population is outrageous . To be sure , many women are quickly reassured by a second test that their breast is normal . But others  while told they dont have cancer  are told that their breast is somehow abnormal , that they have dysplasia or atypia , that they are at high risk. Whether you blame the doctors or the system or the malpractice lawyers , its a problem that needs to be fixed .Then there is the problem of overdiagnosis : the detection of a cancer that was not destined to ever cause problems . Overdiagnosis is what leads to overtreatment . A decade ago doctors debated whether this problem existed in breast cancer . Now the debate is about how often it occurs .In a pamphlet to help women decide about mammography screening in Britain , the National Health Service now explicitly tells women that their chance of overdiagnosis is about three times higher than their chance of avoiding a breast-cancer death . I cant tell you if that is the right estimate ; since most everyone who receives a diagnosis of cancer is treated , overdiagnosis is rarely observed directly , so it is notoriously difficult to quantify . But I can tell you its in the ballpark . Our optimistic/pessimistic finding is this : Among a thousand 50-year-old American women screened annually for a decade , 3 to 14 will be overdiagnosed and overtreated .What about the benefit ? Among those thousand women , 3.2 to 0.3 will avoid a breast-cancer death . If you dont like decimals , call it 3 to 0 .The optimistic estimate reflects the most favorable result of the nine most comprehensive randomized trials of breast cancer screening . But these trials were initiated 20 to 50 years ago . Whether their results are still relevant is a question . Because of substantial improvements in breast cancer treatment , many cancers that would have been deadly 20 years ago now no longer are . The better we are able to treat cancer , the less important it is find it early ; in other words , there are fewer deaths for screening to help avoid . This is what is reflected in the pessimistic estimate . One study comparing regions with similar populations and health care systems , but different screening policies ( like Sweden versus Norway and Northern Ireland versus the Republic of Ireland ) , found that breast cancer death rates had declined at similar rates , regardless of when mass screening was adopted .So put it all together . Among a thousand 50-year-old American women screened annually for a decade , 3.2 to 0.3 will avoid a breast cancer death , 490 to 670 will have at least one false alarm and 3 to 14 will be overdiagnosed and treated needlessly . That may help some women choose whether to be screened or not . But its still not very precise , and it doesnt answer the fundamental question : Now that treatment is so much better , how much benefit does screening actually provide ? What we need is a clinical trial in the current treatment era .Two randomized trials could begin to answer the central question of mammography interpretation : How hard should the radiologist look ? Women who view mammography favorably might be willing to be screened under either the current approach or a high-threshold approach  meaning their radiologist would ignore small , likely harmless abnormalities found on a mammogram.Those who view it less favorably might choose that high-threshold approach ( knowing that the harms of false alarms and overdiagnosis would be minimized ) or forgo mammography completely .Putting the two trials together , we could finally learn what level of screening minimizes false alarms and overdiagnosis while saving the most lives . Most experts would say that its never going to happen . It would cost too much , take too long and need too many subjects .Maybe they are right . But maybe not . Sure , it would cost millions of dollars . But thats chicken feed compared with the billions of dollars we spend on breast cancer screening every year . Sure , it would take 10 to 15 years . But it would help our daughters know more . Sure , it would take tens of thousands of women to participate . But maybe they would want to be part of the effort to help sort out the morass surrounding what is one of the most common medical interventions done to American women .You never know , until you ask .None of this should dissuade women from seeking a diagnosis when they develop a new breast lump ( thats a form of early diagnosis we all agree on ) or from seeking treatment for a diagnosed breast cancer ( better treatment , not early detection , is the real success story in breast cancer ) . The uncertainties are about screening . Women who want to reduce those uncertainties will have to participate in trials ."
-1	"So  I am aware that having the Republican House Majority Leader defeated by a no-name insurgent tends to cut against my ongoing argument , hotly contested by Jonathan Chait and others on the left , that the Democrats should be worried about their coalition holding together in the next presidential cycle . But because Im stubborn , Im going to celebrate Cantorgeddon by going one more round on the subject of whether President Obamas approval ratings should be a cause of concern for his party , by responding to my colleague Nate Cohns contention that for now , at least , they shouldnt be .In particular , Cohn argues that we should probably expect modern presidents to struggle to maintain solid approval ratings outside of presidential election years , and that liberals need not be too troubled by Obamas current slump: Mr. Obamas lower approval ratings  might just reflect the difficulty of maintaining election-year levels of support from Democratic-leaning voters , and the difficulty of earning crossover support in an increasingly polarized era .No president has averaged 90-plus-percent approval ratings among his partisans throughout his term , even though about 90 percent of partisans usually vote for their party in presidential elections . Bill Clinton , for instance , averaged an 84 percent approval rating among Democrats in Gallups polls in 1997  Thats only a tick higher than Mr. Obamas 80 percent approval rating among Democrats in Gallup surveys so far this year  Nonetheless , Mr. Clinton earned significantly higher general approval ratings than Mr. Obama because he earned considerable crossover support , including from about 30 percent of Republicans . Mr. Obamas opposition has been extremely unified . That makes it difficult for Mr. Obama to earn overall approval ratings at or above 50 percent .So Mr. Obamas approval ratings dont necessarily mean that he has lost an unusual amount of support where it matters . Mr. Obama might well be retaining the approval of a healthy percentage of his supporters from 2012 , with his approval ratings deceptively low because of nearly unanimous Republican opposition .Its hard to find evidence suggesting that Mr. Obamas weakness stems from a deeper problem , like alienating some portion of Democratic-leaning voters .Cohn is quite right that polarization has put a pretty hard ceiling on Obamas potential support . But the president has faced nearly unanimous Republican opposition for almost his entire presidency , so while that opposition explains why he cant get to Reaganesque approval ratings , it doesnt really explain his post-2009 ups and downs , up to and including his long post-2012 swoon . And I do think theres evidence that this swoon reflects a deeper problem than just a lack of enthusiasm among loyal Democrats  that it is , in fact , possibly hitting the party where it matters.For instance : The presidents job approval ratings , while lower since 2012 among Democratic partisans , have also fallen sharply among independent voters , substantially more of whom now rate his performance unfavorably than did so during his previous , first-term approval-rating lows . This pattern is not entirely dispositive , of course , because the category of self-described independents changes with political circumstances , and many people who fall into it are really partisan leaners who almost always vote G.O.P . or Democratic . ( This is part of why Kerry and Romney both won the independent vote without winning the presidency . ) But Obamas current struggles with this group still suggest that his approval-rating problem isnt exclusively a matter of undermotivated Democrats who will eventually fall into line for his successor ; its also a sign , at least potentially , that hes lost the confidence of at least some voters who are more weakly attached to his coalition , and whose votes that coalition needs .As further suggestive evidence on this score , I would submit the following recent polling from Pew:Obamas current approval measure is much higher than George W. Bushs at this point in the 2006 midterm , and Obama is less of a drag on his partys midterm prospects than Bush was Yet the publics desire for a change from the presidents policies is almost as widespread as it was during Bushs second term . [ emphasis mine  R.D . ] Thinking about the next presidential election , 65 % would like to see the next president offer different policies and programs from the Obama administration while 30 % want Obamas successor to offer similar policies . In April 2006 , 70 % wanted the next president to have policies different from Bush ; 23 % wanted similar policies . By contrast , in June 1999 , at a later point in the Clinton administration , just half wanted the next president to pursue different policies .And to the point , raised by Chait in our back-and-forth , that the G.O.P.s unpopularity is necessarily the Democratic Partys saving grace , these Pew numbers seem worth highlighting: Despite weak job ratings for Republican leaders , the public is divided over whether their economic policies or Obamas would do more to strengthen the economy over the next few years . About four-in-ten ( 43 % ) think Republican leaders policies would do more for the economy while about the same share ( 39 % ) says Obamas policies would be more effective .Then just to add a further data point , since Chait seems confident that the presidents numbers are trending upward now that Obamacare has stabilized : This weeks Bloomberg poll , taken after the Bergdahl and V.A . controversies , has Obamas approval rating at 43/53 , the lowest number of his presidency in that survey . And I would also note that if you can tear your eyes away from Cantors dgringolade , youll notice another headline today that may soon have some implications for the publics judgment on this presidents stewardship  which will not , I freely concede , translate into a rejection of his party if the Republicans ultimately can not get their act together . So far its true , as Cohn points out further on in his piece , there arent a lot of indications in the midterm polling that the G.O.P . is currently making the most of the opportunities created by the publics discontent . And its also possible that the aftermath of last nights primary upset will create a new downward spiral for Republicans , a new doom loop of intransigence and folly , that would leave the party ill-equipped to make the most of the countrys apparent desire for a post-Obama change .Those are an excellent reason for Democrats not to panic  and again , with Hillary in the wings , I dont think they should . But they arent reasons for them to be unworried in the face of evidence that their underlying advantage for 2016 is distinctly fragile , and that clear opportunities to shatter it exist ."
-1	"Because its tax day , because he mentions me and because Im easily provoked , below the quote youll find three rejoinders to Jonathan Cohns admirably forthright argument that American society would be much better off if most of us were writing larger considerably larger checks to Uncle Sam:Maybe you dont like tax day  [ because ] it reminds you of how high taxes areand you think that , because of those high taxes , the economy grows more slowly . That would mean fewer jobs and less pay for youand the country as a whole . Its not a crazy argument  But the evidence for this point of view turns out to be thinner than youve probably heard . Relative to other countries , tax rates in the U.S. are relatively low , even when you throw in local and state taxes and add them to federal levies . Overall , according to the Tax Policy Center and Center on Budget and Policy Priorities  taxes in the U.S. are among the lowest in the developed world . The average for countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development , an organization of rich countries , is higher . And in countries like Sweden , Norway , and the Netherlands countries , the average is much higher . In those nations , taxes account for more than half of total national income .That level may sound scary but , as many of us have written before , you could make a good case that the people of Scandinavia and Northern Europe know what they are doing . They are far more secure , thanks not only to national health insurance but also to generous provision of child care and unemployment benefits . And despite the high tax burden , their economies have historically been strongin part , because the combination of investment and a secure safety net makes people more comfortable with a dynamic , ever-changing economy . The wonks used to call this economic model flexicurity.As conservatives like New York Times columnist Ross Douthat note , you cant simply import that model to the U.S. wholesale . But the Scandinavian experience is one reason that many economists and policy experts think theres room for U.S. taxes to rise  .1 ) Its true that the U.S. has a lower tax burden than most developed countries . Its also the case that the U.S. is much , much richer than most developed countries , in ways that a casual trip to Paris or London or Stockholm can sometimes obscure . The I.M.F.s numbers have our purchasing-power-adjusted per capita G.D.P . at $ 53,101 , which is slightly lower than oil-rich Norway ( and Luxembourg ) but more than $ 10,000 higher than Sweden and more than $ 15,000 higher than Denmark ; most of the rich European economies are clumped together between the mid-thirties ( where youll find the French ) and the low forties ( where youll find the Germans ) . Now : This wealth gap doesnt necessarily prove anything about the link between low taxes and growth , since the U.S. has basically always been richer and ( as Cohn notes ) many of the social democracies have grown at a very respectable rate , in per capita terms , over the last few generations . But if you flashed back to the 1970s , you would find a number of very smart people who expected northern Europe ( and Japan ) to achieve more than respectable growth , and do more than just keep up with U.S. growth : They expected , for plausible theoretical reasons , that we would see continued convergence between the American economy and its developed-world competitors . And that , to put it mildly , did not happen ; instead , post-Reagan , the social democracies actually slipped back a bit . So without claiming anything dispositive , I would be much more cautious than Cohn about the claim that growth and tax rates are unrelated , and much , much more hesitant about treating major tax increases as basically a free lunch .2 ) And speaking of that free lunch  its also quite possible that the European economic story would look rather different , and rather less impressive , if American political economy had always looked more Swedish or French , and hadnt pursued growth and innovation at quite the same frantic , Anglo-Saxon pace . This is , again , a highly contentious topic , but theres a certain plausibility to the idea that ( in the language of Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson ) the developed worlds different tax-and-transfer models are actually complementary flavors ,  and that in a world where rich economies all converged on a single cuddly model of capitalism everyone  poor Scandinavians as well as rich Americans  would , on a long time horizon , eventually end up worse off . ( Here its also worth pointing that if these complementarities and spillover effects do exist , the sheer size of the U.S. economy means that Europeanizing our tax-and-transfer model would represent a much more high-stakes roll of the global-economic dice than the kind of bringing a lone outlier closer to the norm scenario that country-by-country comparisons sometimes evoke . )3 ) Then on what you might call the question of implementation , Cohn concedes the very general point that we cant simply impose Swedish structures on the United States and call it a day , but he doesnt address the more specific problem suggested by that concession : Namely , that a lot of liberal proposals essentially ask us to assume that American government  the quasi-imperial government of a vast , diverse , immigrant-heavy continent of three hundred million people  can somehow , in some future dispensation , approach the efficiency of welfare states administered on a much smaller scale and for a much more homogenous population . Which is to say , they wave away one of the central problem with existing public outlays in the U.S. , which in other contexts theyre happy to highlight  the absence , in core areas like health care and education , of a clear link between increased spending and better outcomes . Or else they acknowledge the link , but assert that the best way to reform our kludgeocracy is to pursue greater efficiency in program design while simultaneously pouring more money into the system overall  using a heaping-full of sugar to make the medicine go down , if you will . ( This was the basic theory of Obamacare , and also of more bipartisan reforms like No Child Left Behind . ) It isnt a crazy theory , but I think its reasonable to worry that in a system as inefficient and cross-pressured as ours , the sugar simply offsets or counteracts the medicines effects . And that possibility makes a strong case for holding the tax burden constant while seeking de-kludge-ification , rather than pre-emptively handing more money to bureaucracies and programs that arent exactly being managed with Nordic efficiency , and arent showing the most impressive of results .*To the foregoing Id add one further , non-rebutting point : Namely , that regardless of whether one prefers Scandinavian-style social democracy to a lower-tax , more laissez-faire-ish mixed economy on moral grounds , the case for higher taxes gets stronger to the extent that the U.S. model doesnt seem to be working on its own terms . By this I mean that all systems involve trade-offs , and our model is no different : American-style capitalism promises higher living standards overall in exchange for higher individual risks ; faster growth rates in exchange for greater inequality ; lower unemployment rates in exchange for fewer workplace protections ; more liberty for innovators and entrepreneurs in exchange for somewhat less solidarity-as-redistribution . But if this promise isnt being fulfilled , as has been the case in the last decade  if only the rich are seeing income gains , if the pace of growth and innovation are slowing even as inequality gets wider , if workforce participation is actually dropping below the European norm  then its inevitable that the model itself will start to bleed support . So at least part of the left-right divide at the moment ( visible in the Picketty discussion , the guaranteed-income vogue , and the like ) is over whether we should accept this breakdown , this failure of the American promise , as a permanent feature of our political economy  in which case the argument for high taxes does look stronger , because theres less to lose  or whether we should still be making policy on the assumption that while the 2000s may have been a lost decade for the American dream , a revival of our models advantages is still a real , worth-desiring possibility ."
-1	"IF the government shutdown has shown us anything , its that the 80 or so House Republicans driving the crisis have emerged as the most unified force in politics : tightly organized , highly disciplined and ideologically firm .But wasnt their plan to make the budget a vehicle for defunding President Obamas health care legislation doomed from the start ? And even if this small band has the backing of voters in their safely drawn red districts , as well as Tea Party support , havent their unyielding tactics antagonized a majority of the public ?In fact , this minority faction  the suicide caucus ,  as the conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer has called it  may be less shortsighted and self-defeating than it appears . At a time when so many officials in both parties still invoke the virtues of compromise and perpetuate the ideal of common ground on which conservative pragmatists can meet moderate Democrats ,  these more combative Republicans may be in the vanguard of a new post-consensus politics .Consider the warnings of many , including some in the conservative establishment , that the shutdown will rebound against the party . As evidence they cite the shutdown of 1995 . The winner then was President Bill Clinton , who deftly used the episode to right his wobbly presidency and then coasted to a second term in 1996 .But Ted Cruz , the Texas senator who helped set the stage for the conflict , has offered a different interpretation . Those prophesying ruin need to go back and read their history books a little more closely regarding 1995 , he said on Laura Ingrahams radio show in July . In the next election , 1996 , Republicans held on to the majority in the House , the first time Republicans had done that since 1930 , in 66 years ,  Mr. Cruz pointed out . We lost a total of nine seats in the House . In the Senate , we gained two seats.Mr. Cruz , in other words , was calculating the odds of success in terms of the Congressional , rather than presidential , outcome . This makes sense , since he was born in 1970 and came of age in the years when his party struggled to build national majorities ( winning the popular vote only once in the six presidential elections held from 1992 to 2012 ) and instead flexed its muscles through the legislature .Changing demographics would seem to weaken the appeal of anti-government figures like Mr. Cruz ( who was born in Canada and is of Cuban ancestry ) . That is why traditional conservatives like the columnist Michael Gerson insist that pragmatic Republicans are the partys salvation , and that Mr. Cruz and his allies are mounting a revolt against reality.But as America becomes more diverse , another population has come more clearly into view : the alienated and disenchanted . These people have embraced a libertarian and anti-government outlook and have little use for what they see as the compromised , impure big government conservatism of the Reagan and Bush years .To this constituency , the Republican who will go as far as he can  taking one last crack at undoing Mr. Obamas health care reform or voting later this month not to raise the debt ceiling  is not an obstructionist but a politician of principle , a rebel with a cause .The business of the opposition is to oppose ,  as Robert A. Taft , the Republican senator who led the attempt to slow down New Deal programs , once said .Recent victories that Republicans have won , for instance on gun control , have come not through compromise but by out-organizing and outspending their opponents . The hallowed idea of consensus , and the dream of building a majority , has given way to a survival strategy .The most striking example of Republican opposition is the revival of the doctrine of states rights , historically associated with slavery and Jim Crow . There are unmistakable overtones of this past in the anti-Obamacare movement in some of the 26 states , especially in the Deep South , that have rejected the Medicaid expansion ."
-1	"As an interlude between reform conservatism and  posts , I want to return to the Mark Lilla essay on our present political situation that I commented on a couple of weeks ago , this time to quibble a little bit with its title . That title is The Truth About Our Libertarian Age ,  and most writers Ive seen commenting on the essay  from my colleague David Brooks to Andrew Sullivan to Damon Linker  have tended to basically accept Lillas formulation , which links the spread of cultural individualism ( defined as an outlook with treats as axiomatic the primacy of individual self-determination over traditional social ties ) to the durable triumph of neoliberalism in political economy , and places both under the umbrella of a libertarianism ascendant .Now I would not dispute that ours is , in certain ways , a libertarian moment and age . But the label does not completely fit the phenomena that Lilla  in what is , to reiterate , a truly rich essay  is trying to grasp and wrestle to the mat . Consider , for instance , his description of the European Unions internal contradictions:Since the 1980s , the European Unions project of economic integration has been governed by neoliberalism , a powerful form of contemporary libertarianism . There were concrete reasons for this , having to do with certain failures of the welfare state and the sluggishness of economies held down by state-run enterprises , over-regulation , and powerful unions . But as time passed the reasons were forgotten and neoliberalism became what it is today : a dogma that obscures its real-world effects , which are not just economic .It is shocking , for instance , to see how slow Europeans have been to recognize how seriously the EU neoliberal approach to economic integration jeopardizes the principles of democratic self-government that were recovered after World War II  The result is that ordinary Europeans today do not know what to make of the European project.They see that the weighty decisions are made in the Brussels bureaucracy or in the European Commission , whose members are not directly elected . The European Parliament is elected , but there are no pan-European parties to offer comprehensive programs for governing and suffer the consequences if they fail to enact them .  As for constructing European identity , one need only point out , as many have done , that the euro note shows not a single historical figure or place or monument that might resonate with citizens from Glasgow to Taormina , and that few are aware of the anthem that the EU has chosen for them . ( It is Ode to Joy ,  ironically enough . ) Not only has massive immigration shaken Europeans national sense of we ,  so has the continual expansion of the EU borders to the east and southeast and , who knows , perhaps one day to the southern rim of the Mediterranean It is little wonder that citizens today in both weak and strong nations feel duped and distrust each other . As Greece and other nations have teetered on the edge of insolvency and the EU has demanded austerity , their citizens have rightly sensed that they are losing control over their collective destinies . But this is also true of the restless German public , which worries that it has signed an economic suicide pact with profligates . Nationally elected officials in the weaker states , hoping to stay in office while having to impose austerity , point to the Germans ; the Germans shift blame to the EU solvency rules . The EU then points to the omniscient financial markets , which refer you to American bond-rating agencies , which are staffed by MBAs working in cubicles who have become , faute de mieux , the new sovereigns of Europe . And what they demand is less democracy and more reliance on technical governments and economic experts I agree with a great deal of this portrait  except the suggestion that neoliberalism and libertarianism are the only deep forces at work here . First , Lillas language seems to imply that the sluggishness of economies held down by state-run enterprises , over-regulation , and powerful unions belongs to Europes past , which is perhaps not quite accurate in every case  and that inaccuracy , and the persistence of Eurostatism it effaces , should cast some doubt on the idea that neoliberal or libertarian ideas are the only dogma that matters on the contemporary continent .Then , further , look at how Lilla himself describes the restructuring of power in modern Europe : Ordinary Europeans today do not know what to make of the European project  weighty decisions are made in the Brussels bureaucracy or in the European Commission  [ there is ] more reliance on technical governments and economic experts. What hes describing is a bureaucratic power grab , the machinations of a managerial elite , the rule of regulators , the growth of the administrative state  and while these forces are compatible with neoliberal economic policies and socio-cultural permissiveness , they are not remotely libertarian in nature themselves ; indeed , their power strictly precludes many limitations on governments size and scope , and encourages centralization and consolidation of power in many spheres instead .And whats true of the E.U.s development is also true in other areas of contemporary Western life , where the patterns Lilla describes , plausibly , as libertarian coexist with other trends that represent something else , or maybe somethings else . Think of the post-9/11 growth of the national security state ( which advanced , yes , in part through neoliberal means like government contracting ) ; think of the expansive war-on-terror powers the last two administrations have claimed ; think of the militarization of local police forces and the only-recently-reversed expansion of mass incarceration ; think of the consistently ( if sometimes confusingly ) corporatist element in our economic policy under governments of the right and left alike ; think of the easily-observable expansions of legal and administrative oversight in almost every walk of life . Then think of what you might call the panoptical aspect of modern society  the vanishing ( or willing surrender ) of privacy in the online realm , the wealth of personal information that weve placed at the fingertips of analysts in Silicon Valley and N.S.A . headquarters alike , the increasing clout of both official bodies and unofficial coteries ( from soi-disant human rights commissions to Twitter mobs ) intent on policing and punishing deviations from right thinking and  I could go on , but I think readers will recognize the realities Im describing .There is , of course , also strong resistance to many of these trends . ( The N.S.A.s powers are contested and John Yoo is widely reviled ; causes like prison reform and copyright reform both have footholds in our politics ; the Canadian speech police ultimately saw their case against Mark Steyn dismissed ; Hobby Lobby won its case against the Departmant of Health and Human Services , etc. ) . But such resistance is just that  a pushing back , as yet only intermittently successful , against the growing power of certain institutions ( public and private ) and cultural arbiters over non-conforming individuals and communities . And the overall mix of centralization and forced-conformism thats made this pushing-back seem necessary simply doesnt fit all that comfortably with the description of ours as an essentially/exclusively libertarian age .Which is why I keep returning to James Pouloss evocative phrase the pink police state in these kind of conversations , because it gets at the friendly amendment that Id make to Lillas thesis : Hes describing two pillars of our present regime , cultural permissiveness and neoliberal economics , but theres arguably a third pillar thats more managerial and centralizing and ultimately collectivist , and thats just as crucial to the underlying architecture . This pillars necessary existence is hinted at in his essay  as when Lilla says of our society that the only freedom we are losing is the freedom to choose our freedoms and notes that even in a hyper-individualistic culture we arent now all free to do as we wish ( since wishes inevitably conflict ) . But I dont think he goes far enough in recognizing how large this unfreedom can loom , and how much , well , statism  both old-fashioned and newfangled  is ultimately required to enforce the primacy of individual self-determination over traditional social ties ,  to protect the self-determining individual ( and the self-determining powerful stakeholder , just as importantly ) from the harshest consequences of morally-unconstrained choice , and to regulate and restrain that same self-determination whenever it transgresses the rules of tolerance and diversity .Im afraid I dont have an obvious alternative to libertarian that would encompass this third pillar of our present order , and distill the entire structures complexity to a single word or phrase . But the third pillars heft and importance is too substantial to ignore , and there are all kinds of elements of our age  from too big to fail to the Department of Homeland Security , from the design of Obamacare to the nature of our coalition politics , from the political forays of Mark Zuckerberg to the fate of Brendan Eich  that dont make sense if you cant sense its shadow , or recognize how big a role its likely to play , going forward , in keeping the whole edifice standing up ."
-1	"Responding to my Sunday column , which compared the Democratic Partys diverse presidential-level majority to fin-de-siecle Austria-Hungary and cast Hillary Clinton as the lone political figure capable of playing Emperor Franz Josef and holding the fractious imperium together , Jonathan Chait tweeted that the argument needed 3000 words to be remotely persuasive. Consider this post , then , an attempt to add some of the missing words , with a focus on the Democratic coalitions potential 2016 weaknesses more than Hillary Clintons unique role within the party ( which Ill mention below , but think is mostly self-evident ) .1 ) The Democrats have an Obama problem . The presidents approve/disapprove numbers in the RealClearPolitics average crossed over more than a year ago , and except for the deeper dip during the Obamacare rollout theyve been remarkably steady since : About 44 percent of the country approves , about 51 percent disapproves . ( For context , Obama was at 46 approve/49 disapprove when the Republicans retook the House in 2010 , and 49 percent approve/47 percent disapprove when he won re-election . ) By historical standards , those are not truly dreadful second term numbers  they arent in Truman or George W. Bush territory  but theyre considerably worse than the second-term numbers enjoyed by the only two modern presidents , Reagan and Clinton , who saw would-be successors from their own party win a majority of the popular vote . ( Even during Iran-Contra , Reagan held steady at around 48-49 percent approval . )Of course Obamas numbers could rise a bit if the economy takes off , or some foreign policy crisis intrudes in which he acquits himself well , or ( God help us ) if the Republicans decide to impeach him . But they could also fall as well , if he seems checked out and Democrats check out of defending him . His current position isnt set in stone , but his unpopularity seems pretty durable at this point , a fact on the ground that any assessment of the two parties needs to take into account .2 ) The Democrats have a policy problem . The durability of the presidents disapproval rate is particularly significant because , as Chait argues in a recent post , Obama can actually claim to have fulfilled most of his major campaign promises . There are plenty of policy might have beens  that his supporters can raise ( second stimulus , no sequester , grand bargain , etc . ) , but on the economy , taxes , health care , education and now the environment , this president has indeed done a lot of what he promised he would do  and yet the public , at least currently , pretty clearly does not love him for it .Which in turn leaves his party in the position of seeing its highly-popular , near-landslide-winning 2008 promises ( well repeal the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy and wind down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , and then use the money to fund universal health care/cut middle class taxes/increase spending on other middle-class priorities ) more or less fulfilled , without having reaped much credit from an electorate thats currently pretty sour on this administrations economic record , on its signature domestic policy achievement , its foreign policy stewardship , and its basic competence . And having raised taxes on the rich , having funded semi-universal health care , having wound down our foreign wars , what exactly is the Democratic Partys agenda now ? Some combination of immigration reform , universal pre-K and a higher minimum wage , I suppose , plus maybe more tax increases , depending on how fiscally-sober the party feels . Thats a defensible message ( I certainly expect liberal pundits to defend it ) , but its not an agenda thats obviously responsive to public disappointment with the Obama years .Now of course not having an agenda responsive to disappointment with his record didnt prevent Obama from winning re-election in 2012 , which is part of why liberals have so much confidence his coalitions relative solidity . But there are two further issues to be raised 3 ) The Democrats have a Not-Obama Problem . As various people pointed in in response to my column , all American political coalitions look a little bit like Austria-Hungary , in the sense of being ramshackle , complicated , and diverse . But there really is an unusual level of diversity inside the current Democratic tent  an unusual marriage of upper class and working class and very poor , of ethnic groups with very different stories in America , etc . And Obama really was personally unusual in the sense that his world man brand seemed to make him the embodiment of at least some of this diversity ( its rare candidate who can inspire he understands us , he s one of us identification among both the African-American poor and the globe-hopping liberal rich ) , in ways that undoubtedly made his turnout operations job that much easier . As I wrote yesterday , I think the Hillary Clinton brand could probably accomplish something similar , albeit along a somewhat demographic vector ( gender identification would loom larger , some Scots-Irish voters might be pulled back into the Democratic fold ) . But the average presidential nominee is not as distinctively multitudinous a figure as a Clinton or an Obama . Would Al Gore or John Kerry have had the same turnout edge in an alternative universe 2008 or 2012 ? Would an Andrew Cuomo or an Elizabeth Warren or a Joe Biden or a Martin OMalley ( dissolves into helpless laughter ) in 2016 ? I am extremely doubtful .4 ) The Republicans Really Can Do Better . When you get down to bedrock , a great deal of liberal commentariats current confidence in the Democratic coalitions durability rests on the assumption that the Republican Party will remain a mess  divided against itself along ideological lines , imprisoned by litmus tests and its own forms of identity unpopular , and wedded to an unpopular policy agenda . Danny Vinik , writing in The New Republic , responded to my column with a good distillation of this argument , and it may turn out to be correct : I continue to suspect that the G.O.P . will underperform in the 2014 Senate races for roughly this not-ready-for-primetime reason , and the partys presidential field is unsettled enough at the moment that just about anything could happen two years hence .But at the same time , I think that overall the G.O.P . is in a somewhat better position , on personnel and policy , going into its 2016 nominating process than it was going into 2012 . Theres more distance from the Bush legacy , more urgency about changing the partys message , a more realistic sense of how it needs to change ( nobody , but nobody , thinks the you built that/47 percent material worked out well ) , and far fewer prominent figures insisting that True Conservatism ( TM ) alone will carry the party to an easy victory .The recent springtime for reform conservatism may be just a few shoots in a barren field  but thats still more shoots than at this time four years ago , and nearly everything thats pushed through the ground , whether its been Mike Lee or Dave Camp on taxes or Marco Rubio on the safety net or various senators on health care reform , would have been an improvement on the partys non-message in 2012 . The roster of presidential hopefuls may not be as impressive at it looked before Chris Christies scandal and Marco Rubios immigration reform detour  but were still very unlikely to see a replay of the 9-9-9_/Bachmann Overdrive nonsense , and much more likely to see a group of plausible nominees having a relatively-serious debate . The party may not move on policy exactly the way reform conservatives or libertarian populists or any other group of would-be change agents might lik  . but the odds are very good that the eventual 2016 nominee will offer something more creative than the bland Mr. Republican talking points that Romney campaigned on .And my point , in stressing the Democratic Partys potential weaknesses , is that a little something might actually be enough , even if its less than what Id like to see , and less , by far , than what reform conservatisms left-of-center critics think Republican reform would have to mean .Or it might be enough , that if the Democrats didnt have a uniquely unifying candidate waiting the wings . But they do , her health permitting , which is the irony of this post : All the words ( not quite 2200 , but getting there ) Ive just written about liberalisms weaknesses are in the service of an argument that the Democratic Party will probably win the White House once again in 2016 . I just think it will take a Hillary to do it ."
-1	"At the risk of exhausting my readers , I wanted to return yet again to the debate over workforce participation , because a couple of recent pieces that arent directly about the recent Obamacare argument have been helpful in clarifying the deeper issues in play . The first one is from Martin Wolf of the Financial Times , a sensible man of the center-left , making recommendations for how the developed world might adapt to automation , computerization and the disappearance of low-wage , low-skilled work:Third , we must reconsider leisure . For a long time the wealthiest lived a life of leisure at the expense of the toiling masses . The rise of intelligent machines makes it possible for many more people to live such lives without exploiting others . Todays triumphant puritanism finds such idleness abhorrent . Well , then , let people enjoy themselves busily . What else is the true goal of the vast increases in prosperity we have created ?Fourth , we will need to redistribute income and wealth . Such redistribution could take the form of a basic income for every adult , together with funding of education and training at any stage in a persons life . In this way , the potential for a more enjoyable life might become a reality .The second is a stimulating piece by Ryan Avent , writing for the Economist , in which he argues that our economy may actually be suffering from over-employment  that were losing potential gains from automation because were trying to keep so many human workers on the job . That summary doesnt do the argument justice , so please do read it in full  but here , running parallel to Wolfs argument , is his conclusion:[ If ] full employment is no longer compatible with full utilisation of capital  The global savings glut might well be thought of as a global labour glut .What might a potential solution look like ? Fiscal expansion could help , but the gain from fiscal policy is likely to be limited unless it is structured to try and reduce labour supply . Thats right , reduce labour supply .The most attractive options to accomplish this are probably those which seek to voluntarily reduce the number of hours of full-time work . John Maynard Keynes was right ; a 15-hour work week should be sufficient to provide a worker with a full-time income . But this will require subsidies from the state ; in the form of wage top-ups , perhaps , or a universal basic income . . Redistribution at the scale described above would be very difficult to engineer . Society would face two main challenges ( among a pile of others ) . First , if the tax code were going to raise enough money to support non-workers from a dwindling pool of people earning high market incomes , then the tax code would need to become much more efficient . Otherwise , taxpayers would face intense pressure to reduce their tax burden in any way possible and would generally succeed : enough , anyway , to break the system . The second challenge is related ; however efficient the tax code , the social conflict arising from an effort to reorganise society in this fashion would probably be intense and unpleasant .The upside to managing the transition would be enormous , however . What we are talking about here is a world which is much , much richer . Everyone should be able to enjoy much higher incomes while doing much less work . The endpoint would not be a socialist paradise , necessarily . But it might seem a bit like one , in the way that a 19th century worker putting in 70 hours per week in an attempt to earn enough to keep his family from starving might view a world in which people are able to live in extraordinary comfort ( by comparison ) working just 40 hours per week as something like heaven .These are the sober , restrained , technocratic versions of an argument that gets made more pungently the further left you go  see this column from Salons Alex Pareene for a good example of the genre . In effect , these forays are opening a window into tomorrows policy debates , and raising the question of whether 21st century public policy should even really try to slow the decline of workforce participation  as opposed to welcoming that decline as a sign of liberation , and perhaps hastening it for the sake of efficiency as well .I think its important to concede up front the possibility that Wolf and Avent could be right about where were going . My doubts about the basic-income prescription notwithstanding , in the event that do we end up with an ever-growing share of the population consisting of what Tyler Cowen calls zero marginal product workers , whose continued employment is effectively a drag on productivity relative to the machine alternatives , ideas along those lines could end up being the only plausible policy response .But I also think that even if such a policy shift worked ( in the sense of not breaking the system along the way ) , this scenario could end up being a lot more dystopian than Wolf and Avent  let alone writers further to their left  seem ready to allow . Theyre leaping from a policy designed to protect the new economys potential losers to an optimistic vision of more general age of leisure , and based on current trends Im just not sure that leap is warranted . It seems just as likely that what Wolf calls ( perhaps not entirely aptly ) triumphant puritanism would continue to set the tone for the more successful portion of society , who would continue to work 40 , 50 , 60 hours in a quest for positional goods , and that as a result you would end up with an even more exaggerated version of the social segregation limned by Charles Murray and others  in which Belmont is Belmont and Fishtown Fishtown , and never the twain shall meet .I dont think its unfair to suggest that this future , however potentially inevitable , would represent a grim retreat from basic American ideals . The promise of upward mobility and equality of opportunity would look like a transparent sham in a society with a hypercompetitive elite and a non-working working class . Likewise , the ideal of social equality  which is the really valuable thing that many liberals are groping toward in their critiques of the 1 percent  would probably suffer dramatically if full-time work , like the two-parent family before it , became something that only the better sort of American was likely to experience . And while a sufficiently generous basic income would no doubt raise living standards and reduce deprivation at the bottom , the experience of Appalachia , among other blasted social landscapes , suggests that its very easy for the absence of work to intertwine with social pathologies in ways that government assistance cant necessarily ameliorate . The workless society could be a place where the potential for a more enjoyable life is available to all  but it could just as easily be a society with more alcoholism , more drug addiction , more obesity , lower lifespans , more social isolation , and less human flourishing overall .So while it might be that going from 40 hours to 15 ( or zero ) would offer the same straightforward gains as going from 70 hours to 40 , it also might be that the Keynesian image of a leisured utopia , like the Marxist vision of a future where anyone can hunt in the morning , fish in the afternoon , rear cattle in the evening , criticise after dinner , just as I have a mind  , simply doesnt sufficiently account for either human ambition or human weakness . And Im inclined to resist the trend that Wolf and Avent would prefer that we accept because of the way I suspect these two aspects of human nature would work , together and apart , to make the society they envision much more stratified , divided , polarized and unhappy than the utopians of yesterday expected ."
-1	"PRESIDENT OBAMA has endured much criticism of his legislative skills from his fellow progressives . His conciliatory approach has been compared unfavorably with Franklin D. Roosevelts gleeful pugnacity and Lyndon B. Johnsons relentless arm-twisting . His willingness to strike deals with corporations has been tagged business as usual. Many progressives , frustrated over the past three years , have concluded that the political system is fundamentally broken because corporate power has been allowed to suffocate popular liberal policies .But the Supreme Courts upholding of Mr. Obamas health care law reminds us that the presidents approach has achieved significant results . If his liberal critics paused to assess how he achieved such results , they would not see a system paralyzed by corporations ; they would see that the most liberal reforms in more than 40 years have been brought about because Mr. Obama views corporate power as a force to bargain with , not an enemy to vanquish .The necessity of corporate support for , or at least acquiescence to , liberal policies is not a new development in the history of American liberalism . Indeed it has been one of its hallmarks .Roosevelt may be remembered for his combativeness toward corporations ; he famously said , I welcome their hatred. But he said that in 1936 , only after key New Deal legislation had passed with the help of the United States Chamber of Commerce and the American Bankers Association .Early on , Roosevelt was quite adept at bargaining with corporations . In his first 100 days , to attract corporate support for the National Industrial Recovery Act , he won collective bargaining , minimum wages and maximum hours in exchange for a temporary suspension of antitrust law , so businesses could fix prices . To establish the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1934 , he made concessions to Wall Street that scrapped statutory requirements in favor of regulatory flexibility . The following year , to allow the Federal Reserve to better conduct monetary policy , he gave bankers representation on the policy committee .Johnson also found little value in warring with corporations . He won a Keynesian tax cut in early 1964 , defeating budget-conscious conservatives , thanks to a broad coalition that included corporations . He attracted business support to back his first antipoverty bill by junking plans to promote family farming and push businesses to hire long-term unemployed people . He created the Transportation Department , in 1966 , only after exempting resistant shipping interests from its jurisdiction . He incited a new era of environmental protection , increasing federal responsibility for cleaning air and water , while defusing corporate opposition by trading away federal pollution standards .Democratic presidents typically pay dearly when they choose to fight corporations instead of deal with them . Jimmy Carter sapped his political capital in the first two years of his presidency by trying to pass , with belligerent anticorporate rhetoric , a National Energy Act that would reduce our dependence on oil . He gave two major national addresses intended to rally the public and fend off critics attacks . At a town hall , he lashed out at oil companies for enjoying a position of privilege in our country for too long and having undue influence in Congress . But these confrontational tactics failed to rouse enough public ire to trump that influence , and Mr. Carter settled for a far smaller energy bill than he originally demanded .Or consider President Bill Clinton . In 1993 , his health care task force largely resisted meeting with insurance lobbyists as it drafted legislation . In turn , the insurers didnt wait for the legislation to be finalized before embarking on a vicious advertising campaign . When the first lady , Hillary Rodham Clinton , tried to belittle that effort , fund-raising for the insurance lobby skyrocketed and its advertising budget quintupled . Mr. Clinton , his bully pulpit diminished , couldnt get Congress to vote on his bill . He suffered such a humiliating defeat that his ability to enact any other progressive reform was severely crippled ."
-1	"My Sunday column , on Thomas Pikettys revival of the old argument that capitalism tends to enrich the capital-rich Few much , much faster than the laboring Many , didnt take a position on the plausibility of the French economists basic forecast , which foresees upper-tail inequality rising forever absent a sustained political disruption . ( For a more qualified observers critique of that forecast , Tyler Cowens review and follow-up are the place to turn . ) Instead , I argued against the view that such a trend would necessarily lead to such political disruptions , or indeed be particularly destabilizing to the developed worlds societies . So long as a rich countrys Many see some real gains , I suggested , whether through modest growth and/or modestly-increasing redistribution , we arent likely to see anything remotely like the kind of literal class warfare that the last gilded age produced .The likelihood of such class-based violence and upheaval is not central to Pikettys thesis . But its invocation , amid the Balzac references and Titanic call-outs and Marx-imitating title , is part of what gives his Capital in the Twenty-First Century its frisson .Early in the book , for instance , he cites Haymarket and the fusillade de Fourmies as case studies in past labor-capital conflicts , and asks , portentously , whether this kind of violent clash between labor and capital belong [ s ] to the past ,  or whether its likely to be an integral part of twenty-first-century history ? Where rich economies are concerned , heres my columns case for why the answer is , probably not: as the Manhattan Institutes Scott Winship has pointed out , Pikettys data seems to understate the income gains enjoyed by most Americans over the last two generations . These gains have not been as impressive as during the post-World War II years , but they do exist : For now , even as the rich have gotten much , much richer , the 99 percent have shared in growing prosperity in real , measurable ways . even if Pikettys broad projections are correct , the future he envisions might be much more stable and sustainable than many on the left tend to assume . Even if the income and wealth distributions look more Victorian , that is , the 99 percent may still be doing well enough to be wary of any political movement that seems too radical , too utopian , too inclined to rock the boat .This possibility might help explain why the far left remains , for now , politically weak even as it enjoys a miniature intellectual renaissance . And it might hint at a reason that so much populist energy , in both the United States and Europe , has come from the right instead  from movements like the Tea Party , Britains UKIP , Frances National Front and others that incorporate some Piketty-esque arguments ( attacks on crony capitalism ; critiques of globalization ) but foreground cultural anxieties On the point about the right and cultural anxiety Ill have more to say later , but for now I want to address a potential left-wing rejoinder to the above argument : Namely , that in an age of constantly-increasing inequality the modest-but-real middle and working class gains of the past few decade are likely to eventually diminish and disappear , because the super-wealthy will eventually get powerful enough to make sure that all ( or almost all ) new wealth eventually flows upward .This argument would take the recent economic trends discussed in my last post  the fact that in the United States , the gains for the 90 percent that Winship describes were stronger in the 1980s and 1990s than in the last decade  and extrapolate it forward ; it would weave in a version of the story Voxs Ezra Klein tells here about how the doom loop of oligarchy concentrates income and wealth and also protects the wealthy from political challenges ; and it would end up with a scenario in which wealth begets power , which begets wealth , which begets power , until upward redistribution of wealth is an ironclad norm and the working classs only option is the barricades .The problem with this Haymarket 2028_ vision , I think , is that it overestimates the unity of the oligarchs ( whose interests and views will collide as often as they align ) and underestimates the power that even a weakened 99 percent ( or 90 percent , or for that matter 47 percent ) can exercise through the ballot box .In the case of the post-1970s United States , in particular , a doom loop theory suggests that we should see marginal tax rates , taxes on capital , and corporate taxes fall persistently as inequality increases and the wealth-power nexus tightens . And it implies , perhaps , that the political/policy center of gravity should shift steadily rightward under the influence of all that self-interested , influence-buying , opinion-shaping money .But the actual policy trend doesnt really look like that . Instead , taxes on high incomes bottomed out in the mid-1980s ( when our Gini coefficient was much lower ) and have bounced around , and upward , in the two decades since ; taxes on capital went down steadily from the 80s into the 2000s , but for high incomes theyre now back where they were in the 1990s ( with an Obamacare surcharge on top ) ; our corporate tax rates were cut in the 1980s but havent much budged since . Meanwhile , the non-defense budget has been on a consistent upward trend ( see figure 3 here ) since , again , the mid-1980s , and elite-driven causes like entitlement reform and immigration reform have been repeatedly defeated by populist rebellions , left and right . And notwithstanding liberal anxieties that the Bush Republicans had found a way to push the whole political debate off center ,  the post-2000 trend toward stagnant incomes helped drive a leftward swing in public opinion , leading to the election of President Obama , an unprecedented surge of stimulus spending , a large expansion of the federal safety net , a significant increase in upper-bracket taxes , and so on .Now its true that post-2010 budget cuts have counteracted some of these leftward policy shifts , and its also true if enacted as written Paul Ryans safety net cuts would send U.S. policy swinging in a direction favored by ( some Republican ) oligarchs . But Ryan was on the ticket that lost the last presidential election , and nobody ( the Wisconsin congressman included , I would say ) believes that his party is well-positioned to win future elections running on an austerity platform alone .The radical left may be weak , in other words , but the center-left is more powerful and better-positioned today than a doom loop theory would suggest . On the evidence of the last generation of American politics , then , rich democratic polities seem likely to respond to increasing inequality and stagnant wages not by handing power over to mustache-twirling robber barons , but by embracing a kind of liberal corporatism , which protects the interests of well-off rentiers and 1 percenters on many policy fronts , but also buys social peace by expanding social welfare programs and raising taxes on the very rich ( whose extraordinary wealth may ultimately make them less tax-sensitive than they were a generation back ) .Such corporatist tax-and-transfer policies arent likely to level the income distribution to anything like the extent that Piketty believes is morally and socially necessary . But they do seem likely , even if his underlying analysis were correct , to tax enough , and redistribute enough , to maintain the richest nations social peace , and avoid violent labor-capital conflict by making even the relatively poor feel like they have too much to lose from such upheaval .I hope its clear that I dont see this as a particularly optimistic scenario . I would much rather live in a society where increasing prosperity is broadly shared than one where its shared just enough , through slowly-rising wages and modestly-increasing transfer payments , to maintain most peoples status quo bias even in the face of widening class divisions and increasing lower-class dependency . And as someone who thinks we face a somewhat different sort of inequality-related crisis than Piketty and the neo-Marxists  one thats more about social and cultural and moral capital than the purely pecuniary sort  Im inclined to welcome radical critiques of current arrangements , because I know a few of my own ideas are pretty radical as well .But that conversation benefits from realism about the current trajectory were on , which for all its problems doesnt necessarily portend major disruptions and class conflicts just ahead ."
-1	"I wrote a little on Wednesday about what I described as the uncertain implications of David Brats primary victory for the future of a more reform-minded conservatism . For a less uncertain take on the matter , here is David Frum , arguing that the only way to reform the Republican Party is for figures like Eric Cantor  or , I suppose , his successors in the leadership  to take the fight more ruthlessly to the partys insurgents:At some point , Republican leaders must recognize that they have a fight on their hands whether they like it or not . If they refuse to join that fight , they will be devoured anyway . If they surrender , they condemn the whole conservative project in America to the destructive leadership of fanatics ( and the cynics who make their living by duping fanatics ) .This lesson keeps being administered . Republican leaders repeatedly refuse to learn .The political exemplar most relevant to todays GOP is not the oft-invoked Ronald Reagan . It is Tony Blair , who revived his party by standing up to its most extreme elements . There is no such leadership yet on the Republican side . If Republicans dont develop it soon , we might just as well already rename our dysfunctional party the Committee to Elect Hillary Clinton .Its fair to say that Frum has taken this view for a long time , while many of us who march ( skip ? toddle ? ) under the reformist banner  see , for instance , Yuval Levin in this post on the relationship between the Tea Party and reform conservatism  have been inclined to hope for , and worked toward , some form of synthesis instead , in which the base-versus-establishment war isnt fought out but somehow transcended . And while Im not sure that such a synthesis is possible , Brats anti-Cantor campaign is actually a useful case study in why it seems so necessary . Here is Ryan Lizza on some of the attack lines Brat used against the House Majority Leader:In his campaign against Cantor , Brat turned every issue into a morality tale about big business cheating ordinary Americans . He attacked Cantor for supporting the farm bill ( Do those billions of dollars go to the small American farmer ? No , they go to huge agribusiness , right ? Big business again. ) , the flood-insurance bill ( Who does that go to ? A lot of the money goes to gazillionaires on both coasts who have homes in nice real-estate locations. ) , and the STOCK Act , an effort to stop insider trading by congressmen , which Cantor gutted by including an exception for spouses By the end of the campaign , immigration reform , another policy championed by Stephenson in his op-ed , had become Brats most visible point of attack against Cantor . But even here , Brat framed the issue within his larger argument about corporate welfare , arguing that the Senate bill would reward big business with a stream of cheap labor at the expense of American workers . ( And anyone who followed the debate over the Senate bill knows that it was larded with favors for big corporations . )So what would it mean for the establishment , as currently constituted and oriented , to fight back against this kind of message ? Should Cantor have gone to the hustings to defend his role in passing farm bills  some of the most abominable pieces of legislation churned out by business-as-usual politics in D.C. ? Should he have talked proudly about how his changes to the STOCK Act improved the bill dramatically ? Should he have followed the example of Lindsey Graham in South Carolina , and defended comprehensive immigration reform on the primary trail ?I know that lots of moderate Republicans would answer yes to the last question . But as a staunch opponent of the Senate immigration bill , Frum himself isnt one of them ; indeed , Brats corporate welfare argument could have been lifted from one of his own critiques of the G.O.P . leaderships zeal for amnesty and guest workers .Instead , Frum would probably say that establishment Republicans need to fight back against what Lizza calls the core of Brats ideology   an unvarnished belief  that the government should return to its pre-New Deal roots. But its worth noting that ( however clumsily ) Cantor tried to do just that : One of his campaigns attack lines against Brat was that the Randolph-Macon academics ideas required the dismantling of Social Security . The line , it seem , did not stick , or else did not trump the whos looking out for you ?  oomph of Brats libertarian populist appeal .So while I agree with Frum that the lets turn the clock back to 1929 aspect of the Tea Party movement , like the bases allergy to compromise in governance , is a big problem for the Republican Party , I just dont see how the establishment can successfully fight its grassroots opponents so long as those opponents have so many perfectly legitimate grievances to fasten on . Instead , you need  somehow  a Republican leadership that can first persuade these voters and activists that its in touch with their concerns , that its philosophically in tune with them , and that it isnt just relying on their votes while ignoring their interests and desires . Reform and innovation can only happen , in this view , in an atmosphere of ideological trust  which is why reformists have placed a lot of their/our hopes in figures who came in with the Tea Party , like Mike Lee and Marco Rubio , rather than expecting a John Boehner or a Mitch McConnell to lead the party forward on policy .Frum , on Twitter yesterday , called this the I 100 % agree with you and thats why we should do the exact opposite of what you say approach to the base and conservative reform . Its a good line , but naturally I see it as more of an I agree with your critique and I share your anger at the status quo , so heres why we should do some of what you say  but then here are some other things that make more sense than shutting down the government argument . And the model for how this works in political practice , I think , would necessarily look more like Reagan than like Blair  not in the sense that it would involve an exact reprise of Reaganomics ( reform conservatisms Wall Street Journal critics are entirely correct that it would not ) , but in the sense that Reagan was a politician who channeled conservative populism without letting it consume him , who was guided by ideology without being imprisoned by it , and who worked , mostly successfully , in the zone where right-wing populism and middle American anxiety overlapped . And that balancing act , rather than the defeat of right-wing populism by the forces of the K Street and their out-of-touch champions , seems like what both the right and the country need again today .As in the late 1970s and early 80s , this kind of synthesis can probably only happen at the presidential level , for some of the reasons my colleague Josh Barro suggests today . And maybe ( as Barro , a continuing skeptic of reform conservatisms prospects , tends to think ) theres simply no figure or figures on the Republican horizon capable of imitating and updating the fortieth presidents success .But the Blair alternative , Frums vision for the G.O.P. , requires a situation that simply doesnt obtain in American politics at the moment : A landscape in which the other side  Thatcherism for the Blairites , Obama-era liberalism for todays right  has won so many clear and sweeping victories that the necessary concessions are basically obvious , and the alternative is clearly just continued political impotence , defeat after defeat after defeat . Thats simply not where we are right now , both headed into 2014 and looking ahead to the post-Obama era . Maybe well end up there eventually , if Obamacare solidifies and becomes more popular , the global situation stabilizes , and the economy gets to 1990s-style growth . But until then , in an unsettled landscape , conservative reformers have an opportunity to offer an actual alternative , rather than just an adaptation  and there is no path to that alternative that doesnt partake , at least to some extent , of the populist spirit currently ascendant on the right ."

-1	"ChicagoEarlier this month , I was hanging out with my brother-in-law Vincent . He lives with developmental disabilities caused by an unwanted genetic sequence that deprives his brain of a critical protein . We were sitting in our family room when Rick Santorum  whose 3-year-old daughter has a different chromosomal disorder  appeared on the television .One of the things that you dont know about ObamaCare ,  Mr. Santorum said , is that it requires free prenatal testing ... Why ? Because free prenatal testing ends up in more abortions and , therefore , less care that has to be done , because we cull the ranks of the disabled in our society. Mr. Santorums comment echoed Sarah Palins famous charge during the health care reform debate : My parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obamas death panel so his bureaucrats can decide , based on a subjective judgment of their level of productivity in society ,  whether they are worthy of health care.There is no basis whatsoever for Mr. Santorum or Ms. Palins comments . Disability advocates across the political spectrum strongly supported the 2010 health care reform . They had obvious reasons to do so . The new law provides protections for people with preexisting conditions , regulations to make sure insurers properly cover care for chronic illnesses and expanded coverage for young adults and low-income families .But more is at stake here than factual inaccuracies . Mr. Santorum and Ms. Palin are spreading a poisonous meme : that liberals disdain the disabled and look down upon parents who raise children with physical or intellectual limitations . They seek to insert the hateful rhetoric of the culture war into one of the few areas of American life that had remained relatively free of such rancor . Care for people with disabilities has quietly been one of the few causes in this country on which social liberals and conservatives could put aside their differences to get important work done . I fear this may be changing , and at the precise moment when budget crises and the knife fight over health care reform place the future of key disability services into doubt .Since at least the 1970s , when the prospect of mass prenatal screening for genetic abnormalities first emerged , many people have worried that such technologies would coarsen public attitudes toward disabled citizens and erode support for essential services . Disability advocates were ( and remain ) divided . Some caregivers regard such tests  which can lead to abortions after unfavorable results  as an affront to the equal humanity of their loved ones . Others quietly note the value of such testing , and even suggest that terminating a pregnancy is sometimes the better course . But no matter how heated the disagreements between the anti-abortion and abortion rights camps , people of good will on both sides found ways to collaborate on the shared goal of improving the lives and opportunities of men and women with disabilities .Many fears regarding screening turned out to be unwarranted . Its remarkable how much our nation has opened its heart to millions of people with intellectual disabilities since the middle of the last century . These developments are doubly admirable because they happened so steadily and so quietly , outside the usual disfiguring frame of partisan politics . Americans of many religions , backgrounds and ideologies have much to be proud of in this story .Consider the World War II conscientious objectors who were assigned to work in state homes for the mentally retarded , and who went public , writing in magazines such as Christian Century about the terrible conditions they had seen . Under Dwight D. Eisenhower , Social Securitys Disabled Adult Child program  from which Vincent still receives lifetime cash benefits  went into effect .The first Special Olympics were held in 1968 , in large part thanks to the efforts of Eunice Kennedy Shriver , an anti-abortion liberal Catholic , and Medicare and Medicaid , the two most important programs for financing the treatment and care of disabled Americans , were enacted in 1965 by Great Society liberals . Richard M. Nixon worked with Congress to enact Supplemental Security Income , which established income security for millions of people with disabilities . Not long after , President Gerald R. Ford signed what is now the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act , guaranteeing access to special education and other services . Senators Edward M. Kennedy and Robert Dole collaborated to pass the Americans With Disabilities Act , which opened many opportunities in public accommodations and the work force , and the business community later stepped up to find ways for adults with developmental disabilities to earn a paycheck for real work .Today , social conservatives in the Knights of Columbus sell Tootsie Rolls on street corners supporting group homes and workshops , while liberal activists fight to ensure that disabled Medicaid recipients have access to proper dental care and other services .As a result of this hard work , things have gotten better . Sixty years ago , the birth of an intellectually disabled child was viewed as a private tragedy . Families did the best they could , for as long as they could , or turned to forbidding public institutions for help . Now millions of men and women with intellectual disabilities live with greater dignity with their families or in human-scale group homes in their own communities . And every day , our family experiences countless acts of kindness and acceptance : harried business travelers patiently wait as we move ever so slowly through the airport security check ; tough South Side Chicago kids wave back when Vincent waves at them ; students at our daughters school react kindly to their classmates unusual-looking uncle .Liberals and conservatives deserve credit for working together to promote genuine progress in these areas . It isnt easy , because we have genuine differences regarding the size and role of government , abortion , separation of church and state . But Mr. Santorum wants to exploit these differences . Mr. Santorum faces an uphill political climb . But whatever happens with his candidacy , he can still tear this particularly delicate piece of our social fabric before hes through . We cant let him do that ."
-1	"NELSONS doctors found the bulge in his abdomen on a Monday . An ultrasound and CT scan showed that a mass was crowding out his stomach and kidneys . It was one of the largest the doctors had ever seen . If they didnt do something , hed be dead in a couple of days .The hospital gave him a blood transfusion because he was anemic . A radiologist noticed that something might be wrong with his adrenal gland . His surgical team removed what turned out to be a 12.5-pound tumor , lifting it out like an overgrown newborn . Nelsons intensive care nurse called his family that night , and his internists gave them regular updates until he was discharged .Nelsons health insurance covered 90 percent of the costs after a reasonable $ 500 deductible . Im happy he has such good health coverage . Hes my dog . And Im jealous of him .He has the kind of health care that Id hoped the Affordable Care Act would usher in for those who , like my wife and me , have to buy health insurance on the open market . Id long been frustrated at how health care shackles people to corporate jobs . I believed this legislation , signed four years ago this month , would free people to pursue their dreams , start new companies and not worry about the health insurance penalty .What I didnt count on was that it would make things harder for me and my wife .First , we were notified that we would be kicked out of our existing $ 263-a-month Anthem Blue Cross plan because it didnt meet the minimum standards of the new law . No problem , I thought . The plans in the new Covered California exchange would most likely be better and cheaper .But we were shocked at what we confronted . The least expensive premium for a couple like us in our 40s would be about $ 620 a month . And because our household adjusted gross income is likely to be over the $ 62,040 cutoff this year , its doubtful well end up with a subsidy to help offset that price increase .Having always had insurance , we began to wonder if we might have to go uninsured , but in the end , we enrolled . Its as if we just bought a new car that we will never see and that we can never pay off .The gulf between my health care world and my dogs was driven home the other week . I have mild asthma . Normally its not a problem , but when I get a chest cold , it becomes severe . One recent day I found that I couldnt breathe . My inhalers were all expired . Id held off refilling them since my insurance would reduce the costs of the $ 58.99 inhalers only by a little more than $ 9 . I knew from past experience that I probably needed a prescription for antibiotics , so I tried frantically to find a medical facility that would take our new Covered California Anthem Blue Cross bronze plan . When I did , they said it would be three weeks before I could see a doctor . Instead , I went to the drugstore and bought all the nonprescription medication that might help .Around the same time , Nelson developed a skin infection . I got an appointment at the vets the next day . They prescribed an antibiotic and did some blood tests . The medication caused diarrhea so I called his internist at his vet hospital , PetCare , and she prescribed a probiotic . Nelsons $ 40.42-a-month pet insurance isnt perfect  for instance it doesnt cover pre-existing conditions  but it paid almost all of these costs , and the vet followed up to make sure he was doing O.K .I was envious . My 11-year-old brown Labrador was getting the kind of treatment that I could only dream of . I wanted to go to PetCare . I wanted pet insurance .I know that Obamacare is helping a great number of people . I understand that for the first time millions of people are getting health insurance . Its the one thing that gives me solace .But lets not pretend that this new policy is the affordable health care savior that many of us were hoping for . For us , our new plan is a big financial hit for a product that does not make it any easier to get basic health care .Its still hard to understand what coverage we have . Its like trying to read tea leaves . Benefits descriptions can be contradictory and run nearly 200 pages long . One summary attached to my online account seems to say that if I go to the emergency room , I could potentially owe thousands of dollars . Another document suggests that Im responsible for only $ 300 . Ive had two representatives give me two different explanations . The more I questioned these well-intentioned people , the more I realized how confused , overwhelmed and at times plain wrong they were .Heres what Ive been able to piece together . Previously , our family deductible totaled $ 13,600 for outpatient care and $ 6,600 for hospital care ( with a maximum combined out-of-pocket cost of $ 13,600 ) . Under our new plan , we have a deductible of $ 10,000 ( and an out-of-pocket maximum of $ 12,700 ) . In both cases , having deductibles that high means this is largely insurance to make sure that we dont go bankrupt if we become very ill . Yes , the new plan has more coverage , including pediatric vision . But we dont have children , and Id trade coverage for things like substance abuse treatment and mental health in return for lower premiums .And if you see a doctor outside your network , look out . We found this out the hard way . My wife and I both had to see a doctor in January . Our old policy and our new Covered California policy were both with Anthem Blue Cross , so a representative there told us to use our old ID cards for our visits since our new cards hadnt arrived yet . We were covered , he assured us . At the medical center , we gave our ID cards to the receptionist , who accepted them as valid , and went in to see our regular doctors . But later we found out that they were not in our new networks plan . The out-of-pocket cost for my simple 30-minute office visit : $ 303 . My wifes annual exam and a couple of minor procedures : $ 918 .Were still waiting for quality health care that we can actually use , afford and understand  the kind of care that Nelson gets ."

-1	"THE device in your purse or jeans that you think is a cellphone  guess again . It is a tracking device that happens to make calls . Lets stop calling them phones . They are trackers .Most doubts about the principal function of these devices were erased when it was recently disclosed that cellphone carriers responded 1.3 million times last year to law enforcement requests for call data . Thats not even a complete count , because T-Mobile , one of the largest carriers , did not initially reveal its total . It appears that millions of cellphone users have been swept up in government surveillance of their calls and where they made them from . Many police agencies dont obtain search warrants when requesting location data from carriers .Thanks to the explosion of GPS technology and smartphone apps , these devices are also taking note of what we buy , where and when we buy it , how much money we have in the bank , whom we text and e-mail , what Web sites we visit , how and where we travel , what time we go to sleep and wake up  and more . Much of that data is shared with companies that use it to offer us services they think we want .We have all heard about the wonders of frictionless sharing , whereby social networks automatically let our friends know what we are reading or listening to , but what we hear less about is frictionless surveillance . Though we invite some tracking  think of our mapping requests as we try to find a restaurant in a strange part of town  much of it is done without our awareness .Every year , private companies spend millions of dollars developing new services that track , store and share the words , movements and even the thoughts of their customers ,  writes Paul Ohm , a law professor at the University of Colorado . These invasive services have proved irresistible to consumers , and millions now own sophisticated tracking devices ( smartphones ) studded with sensors and always connected to the Internet.Mr. Ohm labels them tracking devices . So does Jacob Appelbaum , a developer and spokesman for the Tor project , which allows users to browse the Web anonymously . Scholars have called them minicomputers and robots . Everyone is struggling to find the right tag , because cellphone and smartphone are inadequate . This is not a semantic game . Names matter , quite a bit . In politics and advertising , framing is regarded as essential because what you call something influences what you think about it . Thats why there are battles over the tags Obamacare and death panels.In just the past few years , cellphone companies have honed their geographic technology , which has become almost pinpoint . The surveillance and privacy implications are quite simple . If someone knows exactly where you are , they probably know what you are doing . Cellular systems constantly check and record the location of all phones on their networks  and this data is particularly treasured by police departments and online advertisers . Cell companies typically retain your geographic information for a year or longer , according to data gathered by the Justice Department .Whats the harm ? The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit , ruling about the use of tracking devices by the police , noted that GPS data can reveal whether a person is a weekly church goer , a heavy drinker , a regular at the gym , an unfaithful husband , an outpatient receiving medical treatment , an associate of particular individuals or political groups  and not just one such fact about a person , but all such facts. Even the most gregarious of sharers might not reveal all that on Facebook .There is an even more fascinating and diabolical element to what can be done with location information . New research suggests that by cross-referencing your geographical data with that of your friends , its possible to predict your future whereabouts with a much higher degree of accuracy .This is whats known as predictive modeling , and it requires nothing more than your cellphone data .If we are nave to think of them as phones , what should we call them ? Eben Moglen , a law professor at Columbia University , argues that they are robots for which we  the proud owners  are merely the hands and feet . They see everything , theyre aware of our position , our relationship to other human beings and other robots , they mediate an information stream around us ,  he has said . Over time , weve used these devices less for their original purpose . A recent survey by O2 , a British cell carrier , showed that making calls is the fifth-most-popular activity for smartphones ; more popular uses are Web browsing , checking social networks , playing games and listening to music . Smartphones are taking over the functions that laptops , cameras , credit cards and watches once performed for us .If you want to avoid some surveillance , the best option is to use cash for prepaid cellphones that do not require identification . The phones transmit location information to the cell carrier and keep track of the numbers you call , but they are not connected to you by name . Destroy the phone or just drop it into a trash bin , and its data can not be tied to you . These cellphones , known as burners , are the threads that connect privacy activists , Burmese dissidents and coke dealers .Prepaids are a hassle , though . What can the rest of us do ? Leaving your smartphone at home will help , but then whats the point of having it ? Turning it off when youre not using it will also help , because it will cease pinging your location to the cell company , but are you really going to do that ? Shutting it down does not even guarantee its off  malware can keep it on without your realizing it . The only way to be sure is to take out the battery . Guess what ? If you have an iPhone , you will need a tiny screwdriver to remove the back cover . Doing that will void your warranty .Matt Blaze , a professor of computer and information science at the University of Pennsylvania , has written extensively about these issues and believes we are confronted with two choices : Dont have a cellphone or just accept that youre living in the Panopticon.There is another option . People could call them trackers . Its a neutral term , because it covers positive activities  monitoring appointments , bank balances , friends  and problematic ones , like the government and advertisers watching us .We can love or hate these devices  or love and hate them  but it would make sense to call them what they are so we can fully understand what they do ."
-1	"Oralia Barrios knew shed gotten heavy , but she didnt realize how heavy until she went to the doctor last year . At 5-foot-2 , she weighed 190 pounds . And her doctor at the Open Door Family Medical Center in Port Chester , N.Y. , had bad news : her blood sugar was too high . Her A1c test showed that her hemoglobin level was 5.9 , making her pre-diabetic .I heard that , and I went to pieces ,  she said . In 2002 , her father had died of diabetes-related kidney failure . He was diabetic for a long time ,  she said . He had high blood pressure and was nearly blind . He suffered a lot  and we suffered with him. He was 52 when he died  15 years older than Barrios is now .Unlike her father , however , Barrios could get effective help . The YMCA in nearby Rye is one of 128 YMCAs across the country running the Diabetes Prevention Program . The Y coordinates patient groups at various sites , including at Open Door . Barrios doctor sent her to Rolando Alvarez , a patient advocate at Open Door , who was starting a new group at the clinic for people who were pre-diabetic . It was a big commitment , Alvarez said  she would have to attend a weekly meeting for four months , and a monthly meeting for the rest of the year . Barrios joined a Spanish-language group with four other women . They met around a conference table at Open Door . Alvarez used the Programs formal curriculum : What are healthy foods ? How can I be active ? What can I do besides eat to alleviate stress ? How can I eat healthy food when I eat out ? How do I deal with setbacks ? Participants were given a calorie and fat counter book , and had to record everything they ate .A lot of it was conversation , though  the women helping each other . The most useful thing she learned , Barrios said , was how to say no in a way that was courteous but firm . Some of the women took Zumba or yoga classes together . Barrios started walking and biking , and learned to build more exercise into her job as a housekeeper . I used to wait to collect all the towels and bring them upstairs together . Now I bring them upstairs one by one  I go up and down those stairs with energy.Barrios crash dieted while she waited for the class to start , and lost 22 pounds . By three months into the class , she had lost 23 more , and her blood sugar returned to normal levels . She has now gained back some weight , but its not because her diet is slipping  shes five months pregnant .As anyone who has ever dieted knows , Barrios journey is remarkable . Changing a lifestyle is very , very hard . But the journey of the Diabetes Prevention Program itself is just as remarkable . In 2002 , the New England Journal of Medicine published results of a randomized controlled trial comparing two interventions designed to keep people at high risk for Type 2 diabetes from developing the disease . Participants who took the drug metformin had a 31 percent lower incidence of developing diabetes than people who took a placebo . But far more effective was a lifestyle-change program : participants met individually with nutritionists , exercise physiologists or behavioral psychologists weekly for six months , plus monthly classes afterwards .This group had a 58 percent lower incidence rate  so effective that the study was stopped early , and all participants offered classes .These were great results . But dozens , maybe hundreds , of papers on successful programs are published every year . Im around this type of research a lot : wow ! this works !  and then it never goes anywhere ,  said Ronald Ackermann , director of the Center for Community Health at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine . This one looked particularly unpromising . Hiring professionals for a years worth of training is expensive . And its preventive medicine that the U.S. medical system , with its twisted priorities , doesnt cover . And one-on-one programs cant reach a lot of people . There are 86 million prediabetics among Americans over 20 . Of Americans over 65 , only 23 percent are not prediabetic or diabetic . The problem is big  but this intervention seemed destined to be small .Yet 11 years after the study was published , the Diabetes Prevention Program helped Oralia Barrios to climb out of the danger zone . More than 20,000 people have done the program , and it has the potential to reach enough people to make a significant difference in Americas diabetes epidemic .So how did the Diabetes Prevention Program grow ? Here are the steps .Discover what people should do . Type 2 diabetes , the kind thats epidemic , can be prevented most of the time by eating right and exercising . This was not a mystery ; lack of knowledge wasnt the obstacle .Get people to do it . The obstacle was getting people to actually make these changes  and the news in the study was that people can be helped to make them . Research published this year of those participants in the original showed that while there was falloff , there was falloff in every group  but the program group was still better off . In other words , the gains persisted .The next big breakthrough came with the addition of the YMCA . Ackermann , then at Indiana Universitys School of Medicine , had worked with the Y in Seattle on a previous research project . In 2003 , he and Dr. David Marrero began a study with two YMCA sites in Indianapolis . The control group got normal testing and counseling . At the other Y , the staff was trained in the Diabetes Prevention Program curriculum  adapted for use in group classes . After six months , the program participants had lost 6 percent of their body weight , while the control group members lost only 2 percent , and the differences lasted .This study was proof-of-concept of several steps necessary for scale-up .Get people to do it cheaply . Hiring health professionals to counsel patients individually was expensive  a patients first year cost $ 1400 . But the Y does it for $ 275 to $ 325 . They hired good facilitators  who made a lot less money than nutritionists or psychologists  and then trained them in the Diabetes Prevention Program curriculum . Numerous studies have since shown that outcomes are the same .Get lots of people to do it cheaply . The more significant savings came from switching to group classes  a way to treat many times the people for the same cost . Weve long known that groups are effective at helping people lose weight  at every kind of behavior change , really . The group model combines all these ingredients we know are essential and does it in a way that you get the support and assistance you need ,  said Michele Heisler , a professor of internal medicine and health behavior and health education , at the University of Michigans School of Public Health .Systematically get lots of people to do it cheaply . The discussion was : how do we create a national program ?  said Ackermann . It wasnt that we thought its not a good idea to do this in a church basement . GM and Ford wanted to do worksite groups . But we wanted a national approach.The YMCA had the national structure to spread the program and train facilitators . It focuses on health , knows how to reach low-income people and has thousands of branches . Eighty percent of Americans live within five miles of a Y , and Ys are in or near many neighborhoods that suffer the most from diabetes . If the Y couldnt do it  well , we couldnt think of another national organization ,  said Ackermann .Today , YMCAs in 41 states run program group classes . Half meet at Ys , and the other half meet in places such as libraries , church basements and health centers .Participants average weight loss at the end of the year-long program is 6.1 percent of their body weight . But averages can mislead  a few successes like Barrios can distort them . Alvarezs first class was cancelled because not enough people enrolled . And in the second class he ran , only two of the seven participants met the goal of losing 7 percent of their weight and exercising 150 minutes per week .The day I visited Alvarezs group , which was in its maintenance phase , talking about strategies for dealing with setbacks , only Juana Damin was there . ( I spoke to Barrios later by phone . ) They get through the weekly classes fine ,  Alvarez said . But with maintenance , theyd like to come but its more difficult . Since its once a month , they might forget . And work will always come first.Damin is his most consistent participant . She , like Barrios , lost a lot by crash dieting before the class began . She hasnt lost much more , though  one big reason is the stress of caring for her mother , who is paralyzed from a diabetes-related stroke . But the class has helped her maintain a loss that otherwise might have evaporated .Get someone to pay for it . A work in progress . The Y charges $ 429 for the program ( there are scholarships )  but it should be free . Diabetes is an expensive disease . A 2010 report from UnitedHealth Group says that its average cost to cover a person with no chronic disease is $ 4,400 per year . For a diabetic with no symptoms , $ 11,700 . With complications : $ 20,700 .Another study calculates the cost savings over 10 years if Medicare covered participation in the diabetes program and three to five percent of senior participated : $ 1.3 billion . Such coverage would also result in a million fewer diabetes cases over 10 years .The American health system doesnt much care . Obamacare has brought piecemeal progress ( see here and here ) towards expanding and getting coverage for the program , but in general neither Medicaid , Medicare nor most private insurers cover prevention  although this is starting to change with Obamacares Accountable Care Organizations .In 2009 , the Centers for Disease Control convened a meeting with diabetes experts , YMCA officials and representatives of various insurance companies to discuss what it would take to get coverage . The Y offered a deal : pay for performance . It proposed that insurers only pay when participants attend classes and lose weight . United Healthcare became the first to accept ; now 28 different insurers cover the program . Sen. Al Franken has introduced a bill that would have Medicare cover the program as well .There is a change in the conversation nationally ,  said Jonathan Lever , vice president for health strategy and innovation at the YMCA of the USA . For ACOs , this is attractive . Prevention is a topic . But its not happening in a systematic way . Were knocking at the door . But the jurys still out on whether systems will align to make it possible.Join Fixes on Facebook and follow updates on twitter.com/nytimesfixes .

-1	"Turning back to this weeks official theme , reform conservatisms liberal critics , I want to discuss a recent column from my colleague Thomas Edsall that , without mentioning our quasi-movement by name , raises one of the sharpest objections to our program of any left-of-center piece Ive seen . Where reform conservatives tend to argue for a welfare system and tax code organized more explicitly around work and family , Edsalls piece makes the case that weve already tried something like that approach  have been trying it , in fact , since the early 1990s  and that it has worked out pretty badly , failing completely at its stated work-promoting aims while making life increasingly desperate for the very poor .He has in mind the series of policy shifts , from welfare reform to the earned-income tax credit , that have increased the percentage of safety-net spending going to working Americans and decreased the share going the non-working poor . These policies , he acknowledges , have subsidized the earnings of millions of low-income workers , particularly of married couples with children , pushing them above the official poverty line. But if the question is how successful these changes have been in getting poor people into the work force , then the answer is not very ,  since labor force participation fell sharply for the poor between 1990 and 2012 . And the people who dont benefit from these changes , he writes  especially destitute , childless men and non-working single mothers with kids  have become the casualties of the rightward shift in the war on poverty.These are serious arguments , which is why Im going to recommend this more detailed response from the Manhattan Institutions Scott Winship ( author of the chapter on poverty in the recent Room to Grow collection ) and then borrow/steal some of his points for my own gloss on these issues .Lets start that gloss with Edsalls description of the trend in workforce participation since anti-poverty spending took a more pro-work turn:In 1990 , 50.2 percent of all adults between the ages of 18 and 64 with incomes below the official poverty level did not work ; 39.8 percent of poor men did not work ; and 56.9 percent of poor women did not work .By 2012 , the percentage of poor people who did not work had grown substantially . In 2012 , 59.7 percent of all poor adults between the ages of 18 and 64 did not work . Among poor men in 2012 , 56.7 percent did not work , a 16.9 percentage point increase . For women in 2012 , 62.0 percent did not work , a 5.1 percentage point increase .So , two points about this analysis . First , the 1990-versus-2012 comparison implies that were talking about a steady two-decade-long decline , when it fact there might be nothing steady or consistent about it ; instead , the 2012 figure might be influenced much more by the Great Recession and its aftermath than by any of the policy shifts in the preceding 15-20 years . Second , as Winship points out , looking at the share of poor people who work is a potentially misleading way to assess the impact a policy intended to lift people who do work out of poverty : The policy could be entirely successful and , precisely because it lifts working Americans above the poverty line , could shrink the workforce participation rate for the population that remains below . ( Indeed , Winship notes , the most successful work promotion policy possible would result in 100 percent of the poverty population consisting of non-working families. )So its useful , with those points in mind , to both look at the entire trend in workforce participation over time ( rather than just at two specific years ) , and to look not at Americans below the poverty line but at , say , Americans without a college diploma  a category whose composition wouldnt change if the incomes of people within in it were to increase .If you look at the numbers that way , youll see a workforce participation rate for the less-educated that was relatively stable ( a little higher in the late 1990s , a little lower thereafter ) from Bill Clintons election up to 2007 , at which point it dropped off and has not recovered yet . Which suggests , in turn , that while its fair to say that existing workfare policies have proven insufficient to the challenges of our recent crash-plus-stagnation , their track record at keeping less-educated Americans in the workforce across the last two decades is better  a lot better , arguably  than a quick look at Edsalls numbers would suggest .Then there is the question of whats happened to poverty rates , period , as the safety net has come to lay a stronger stress on work . Citing a paper that found rising rates of extreme poverty in the United States between 1996 and 2011 , Edsall argues that shifting anti-poverty policy toward workfare and income supports has had devastating results for the very poor . But if you look at one of the other papers he cites shows , youll see ( in Figure 2 ) the overall poverty rate falling sharply after that shift , from above 2o percent in the early 1990s  when , again , many of the changes hes criticizing were made  to 15 percent across the 2000s . ( Its risen sightly since , but even post-Great Recession its still lower than it was before welfare reform , the earned-income tax credit , and the rest . ) Likewise , as Winship points out , the child poverty rate fell faster after welfare reform than it did before : You can see this by looking at the same Edsall-cited paper , whose estimates ( in Figure 8 ) show a child poverty rate that was close to 30 percent in 1993 and hasnt broken 20 percent since 1998 .Now its certainly possible that these general gains coexist with worsening circumstances for some people at the very bottom ( though Winship has a fairly-persuasive critique of the extreme-poverty papers results as well ) . But even if that were a problem , it might be better addressed by streamlining the way benefits are delivered to the very poor  substituting the kind of universal credit idea that Paul Ryan has floated , for instance , for the current array of vouchers and hard-to-navigate bureaucracies  than by rolling back the systems broader emphasis on work . And the big picture story here  solid post-transfer reductions in poverty for adults and children alike  still seems mostly like a case for the pro-work policy shift , rather than a study in how a rich society has allegedly given up on the bottom of the income ladder .With these points in mind , I would propose a somewhat different narrative than Edsall of how the rightward shift in the war on poverty has played out . Since the 1970s , this narrative would run , policymakers have confronted an array of trends  stagnating wages , splintering family structures , social breakdown , cycle , rinse , repeat  that have threatened to create not only a permanent underclass but a non-working , permanently-dependent working class . The pro-work reforms that my colleague describes were , in the 1990s and 2000s , at least moderately successful at pushing back against these trends : They did not arrest every negative trajectory ( marriages decline continued , albeit somewhat more slowly in the 90s ) , but they helped to keep low-wage workers attached to the workforce , while lifting a lot of people who would otherwise have been considered the working poor out of official poverty .Today , however , these policies beneficial effects are being swamped by the way that the Great Recession has interacted with and exacerbated various underlying socioeconomic trends . And theyre also being undercut by the fact that post-recession public policy increasingly cuts in a less pro-work direction than it did before  because of the understandable post-2008 decision to keep extending unemployment benefits , because of the work disincentives embedded in Obamacare , because other public programs ( Social Security Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income , in particular  read my colleague Nick Kristof on the latter ) have gradually seen their rolls expand to include many able-bodied workforce drop-outs , and some other trends besides .All of which makes this a good time , one could reasonably argue , not to abandon the pro-work shift , but if anything to push it harder  to create some new carrots and combine them with some new sticks , to shear away a few more of the systems perverse incentives , and to see if we cant make at least some headway against the post-Great Recession retreat from work , rather than just resigning ourselves to a new normal of subsidized post-employment among the once-working poor .This alternative narrative does include , I should note , an implicit concession to reform conservatisms critics , right as well as left : Namely , that since we have already been doing versions of some of the things our little movement wants to do , we have a case study in those policies limits as well as their potential benefits , and we need to be modest and realistic about how much there is to gain from going further . The problems , social and economic , that a more pro-work , pro-family welfare state would push back against are not going to be fixed by wage subsidies or work requirements or universal credits or larger child tax breaks or any other policy you name . They can only be partially mitigated , modestly ameliorated , and the best case for reform conservatism isnt that its in any way salvific : Its that it might give some struggling Americans a little more space , a little more room , and a slightly stronger incentive to rebuild the kind of stability and resilience that only families and communities can ultimately provide ."
-1	"AN insidious trend has developed over this past third of a century . A country that experienced shared growth after World War II began to tear apart , so much so that when the Great Recession hit in late 2007 , one could no longer ignore the fissures that had come to define the American economic landscape . How did this shining city on a hill become the advanced country with the greatest level of inequality ?One stream of the extraordinary discussion set in motion by Thomas Pikettys timely , important book , Capital in the Twenty-First Century ,  has settled on the idea that violent extremes of wealth and income are inherent to capitalism . In this scheme , we should view the decades after World War II  a period of rapidly falling inequality  as an aberration .This is actually a superficial reading of Mr. Pikettys work , which provides an institutional context for understanding the deepening of inequality over time . Unfortunately , that part of his analysis received somewhat less attention than the more fatalistic-seeming aspects .Over the past year and a half , The Great Divide , a series in The New York Times for which I have served as moderator , has also presented a wide range of examples that undermine the notion that there are any truly fundamental laws of capitalism . The dynamics of the imperial capitalism of the 19th century neednt apply in the democracies of the 21st . We dont need to have this much inequality in America .Our current brand of capitalism is an ersatz capitalism . For proof of this go back to our response to the Great Recession , where we socialized losses , even as we privatized gains . Perfect competition should drive profits to zero , at least theoretically , but we have monopolies and oligopolies making persistently high profits . C.E.O.s enjoy incomes that are on average 295 times that of the typical worker , a much higher ratio than in the past , without any evidence of a proportionate increase in productivity .If it is not the inexorable laws of economics that have led to Americas great divide , what is it ? The straightforward answer : our policies and our politics . People get tired of hearing about Scandinavian success stories , but the fact of the matter is that Sweden , Finland and Norway have all succeeded in having about as much or faster growth in per capita incomes than the United States and with far greater equality .So why has America chosen these inequality-enhancing policies ? Part of the answer is that as World War II faded into memory , so too did the solidarity it had engendered . As America triumphed in the Cold War , there didnt seem to be a viable competitor to our economic model . Without this international competition , we no longer had to show that our system could deliver for most of our citizens .Ideology and interests combined nefariously . Some drew the wrong lesson from the collapse of the Soviet system . The pendulum swung from much too much government there to much too little here . Corporate interests argued for getting rid of regulations , even when those regulations had done so much to protect and improve our environment , our safety , our health and the economy itself .But this ideology was hypocritical . The bankers , among the strongest advocates of laissez-faire economics , were only too willing to accept hundreds of billions of dollars from the government in the bailouts that have been a recurring feature of the global economy since the beginning of the Thatcher-Reagan era of free markets and deregulation .The American political system is overrun by money . Economic inequality translates into political inequality , and political inequality yields increasing economic inequality . In fact , as he recognizes , Mr. Pikettys argument rests on the ability of wealth-holders to keep their after-tax rate of return high relative to economic growth . How do they do this ? By designing the rules of the game to ensure this outcome ; that is , through politics .So corporate welfare increases as we curtail welfare for the poor . Congress maintains subsidies for rich farmers as we cut back on nutritional support for the needy . Drug companies have been given hundreds of billions of dollars as we limit Medicaid benefits . The banks that brought on the global financial crisis got billions while a pittance went to the homeowners and victims of the same banks predatory lending practices . This last decision was particularly foolish . There were alternatives to throwing money at the banks and hoping it would circulate through increased lending . We could have helped underwater homeowners and the victims of predatory behavior directly . This would not only have helped the economy , it would have put us on the path to robust recovery .OUR divisions are deep . Economic and geographic segregation have immunized those at the top from the problems of those down below . Like the kings of yore , they have come to perceive their privileged positions essentially as a natural right . How else to explain the recent comments of the venture capitalist Tom Perkins , who suggested that criticism of the 1 percent was akin to Nazi fascism , or those coming from the private equity titan Stephen A. Schwarzman , who compared asking financiers to pay taxes at the same rate as those who work for a living to Hitlers invasion of Poland .Our economy , our democracy and our society have paid for these gross inequities . The true test of an economy is not how much wealth its princes can accumulate in tax havens , but how well off the typical citizen is  even more so in America where our self-image is rooted in our claim to be the great middle-class society . But median incomes are lower than they were a quarter-century ago . Growth has gone to the very , very top , whose share has almost quadrupled since 1980 . Money that was meant to have trickled down has instead evaporated in the balmy climate of the Cayman Islands .With almost a quarter of American children younger than 5 living in poverty , and with America doing so little for its poor , the deprivations of one generation are being visited upon the next . Of course , no country has ever come close to providing complete equality of opportunity . But why is America one of the advanced countries where the life prospects of the young are most sharply determined by the income and education of their parents ?Among the most poignant stories in The Great Divide were those that portrayed the frustrations of the young , who yearn to enter our shrinking middle class . Soaring tuitions and declining incomes have resulted in larger debt burdens . Those with only a high school diploma have seen their incomes decline by 13 percent over the past 35 years .Where justice is concerned , there is also a yawning divide . In the eyes of the rest of the world and a significant part of its own population , mass incarceration has come to define America  a country , it bears repeating , with about 5 percent of the worlds population but around a fourth of the worlds prisoners .Justice has become a commodity , affordable to only a few . While Wall Street executives used their high-retainer lawyers to ensure that their ranks were not held accountable for the misdeeds that the crisis in 2008 so graphically revealed , the banks abused our legal system to foreclose on mortgages and evict people , some of whom did not even owe money .More than a half-century ago , America led the way in advocating for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , adopted by the United Nations in 1948 . Today , access to health care is among the most universally accepted rights , at least in the advanced countries . America , despite the implementation of the Affordable Care Act , is the exception . It has become a country with great divides in access to health care , life expectancy and health status .In the relief that many felt when the Supreme Court did not overturn the Affordable Care Act , the implications of the decision for Medicaid were not fully appreciated . Obamacares objective  to ensure that all Americans have access to health care  has been stymied : 24 states have not implemented the expanded Medicaid program , which was the means by which Obamacare was supposed to deliver on its promise to some of the poorest .We need not just a new war on poverty but a war to protect the middle class . Solutions to these problems do not have to be newfangled . Far from it . Making markets act like markets would be a good place to start . We must end the rent-seeking society we have gravitated toward , in which the wealthy obtain profits by manipulating the system .The problem of inequality is not so much a matter of technical economics . Its really a problem of practical politics . Ensuring that those at the top pay their fair share of taxes  ending the special privileges of speculators , corporations and the rich  is both pragmatic and fair . We are not embracing a politics of envy if we reverse a politics of greed . Inequality is not just about the top marginal tax rate but also about our childrens access to food and the right to justice for all . If we spent more on education , health and infrastructure , we would strengthen our economy , now and in the future . Just because youve heard it before doesnt mean we shouldnt try it again .We have located the underlying source of the problem : political inequities and policies that have commodified and corrupted our democracy . It is only engaged citizens who can fight to restore a fairer America , and they can do so only if they understand the depths and dimensions of the challenge . It is not too late to restore our position in the world and recapture our sense of who we are as a nation . Widening and deepening inequality is not driven by immutable economic laws , but by laws we have written ourselves .This is the last article in The Great Divide ."
-1	"How do institutions change their practices ? In medicine , the usual answer is slowly. Clinical trials can show the efficacy of a new practice  yet , decades later , many physicians still havent gotten the message .Until four years ago , it seemed like early elective delivery was a textbook example of evidence widely ignored . These are induced or cesarean section deliveries after 37 completed weeks but before 39 completed weeks of gestation , when not medically necessary . The reason is usually convenience  the family is coming in for Christmas or the obstetrician will be off next week .Delivery at 37 or 38 weeks was widely considered benign  but it is not . Infant mortality is at least 50 percent higher for babies at 37 or 38 weeks than at 39 or 40 ( at 41 weeks the rate rises again ) . These babies are also more likely to suffer breathing , feeding and developmental problems .The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists had been warning against early elective delivery since 1979 . The March of Dimes , one of the most respected advocacy groups in America , had long campaigned to discourage the practice . Reducing these deliveries shouldnt have been hard  at least , they should have been easier to change than many other harmful practices . For one thing , a reduction in these deliveries saves money . An elective C-section costs a lot more than letting the baby choose the birth date . And fewer early deliveries mean fewer babies in the neonatal intensive care unit  one of the most expensive rooms in the hospital . ( Average charge : $ 76,000 , according to the March of Dimes ( pdf ) . )Another advantage was that the practice was clearly defined  there was relatively little debate about what medically necessary means . The message from advocacy groups and medical societies was unified and unambiguous . Nor were the steps needed to reduce such deliveries complex : hospitals could simply bar them unless a doctor could show medical necessity . This is rare for safety improvements . Bringing down infection rates , for example , requires an entire hospital work force to adopt time-consuming new behaviors and routines .Despite the expert warnings , nothing happened . In 2010 , these deliveries accounted for 17 percent of births . In some states , such as South Carolina , they represented more than a quarter of all deliveries .But 2010 began a vertiginous drop , according to a survey of hospitals released last week by The Leapfrog Group , an organization funded by businesses that are large purchasers of health care to work for quality and safety improvement . Last year the national average was down to 4.6 percent  a fall of 73 percent in three years . In health care , we talk about a 1 to 2 percent change as spectacular  wow , weve really improved ,  said Leah Binder , the president and chief executive of The Leapfrog Group . I have never in my career seen anything like the progress were seeing on early elective deliveries.Something happened in 2010 that didnt happen before with these deliveries  and doesnt happen with other harmful practices . And that something may offer important clues to how to speed things up elsewhere .* Models for change . Elliott Main teaches obstetrics and gynecology at Stanford University and is medical director of the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative . Hes studied the drop in early elective deliveries , and said that the spark for it most likely came from a pair of articles published in the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology in 2009 . They described programs in a hospital in Pennsylvania and a group of hospitals in Utah that produced dramatic reductions in early elective deliveries . Those certainly made everybody sit up and say , yes we can improve obstetric care ,  said Main . It showed there was a pressure point that was reducible.* Measurement . In 2010 , the Leapfrog Group began asking hospitals to report early elective deliveries . About 750 hospitals , accounting for about half the births in the United States , complied . The rates they found shocked a lot of people . Even hospitals themselves didnt know they themselves have high rates ,  said Binder . I cant tell you how many medical directors called me and said , this cant be right.The hospitals Leapfrog count reported voluntarily , which means there could be some selection bias . But in 2013 , the governments Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  which under this administration has introduced glasnost to health care statistics  began requiring hospitals to report . The data coming in is consistent with Leapfrogs . The Joint Commission , an influential nonprofit that accredits hospitals , also recently began including this measure .Measuring and publicizing rates of early elective delivery has helped in several ways . It revealed the dimensions of the problem . It tells hospitals how they are doing . It allows patients to choose safer hospitals , which exerts pressure for more safety . And it creates the basis for reimbursing hospitals in a way that discourages these deliveries .* Payment reform . The pioneers have been Texas and South Carolina . Texas in 2011 barred Medicaid ( thats a state program ; Medicare is federal ) , which pays for 55 percent of births , from reimbursing hospitals for early elective deliveries .In 2011 , South Carolina began the Birth Outcomes Initiative , a program designed to reduce prematurity , increase breast-feeding and make other changes for healthier babies . Those were not the only goals . Medicaid spending accounted for more than a quarter of the entire state budget . We were looking to improve health outcomes and at the same time reduce our cost ,  said Melanie Giese , the programs director . The states 43 hospitals that did births came together and signed a pledge to reduce these deliveries .Tony Keck , the states health and human services director , announced that if the voluntary effort was insufficient , the state would stop reimbursing hospitals for these deliveries . The only payments that South Carolinas government directly controlled were Medicaid ones . But the state was unusual in that its commercial market was dominated by one huge insurer : Blue Cross Blue Shield . Between them , Medicaid and Blue Cross covered 85 percent of the states births . So when Blue Cross agreed to go along , hospitals listened . Even the hint that payment reform was coming meant that hospitals put that on the top of their priority list ,  said Binder .Every hospital appointed one person to lead the drive to stop early elective deliveries . There were  still are  monthly meetings attended by more than 100 people . Each meeting begins with a success story from an individual hospital . Then attendees go to work on specific strategies and tactics . ( For details see this case study by the group Catalyst for Payment Reform . )A year later , there was good progress , but South Carolina had started with one of the countrys highest rates , and officials worried that progress had reached a plateau . Keck announced that the state would cut off payments the next year . The states program gradually prepared hospitals to make the switch .On Jan. 1 , 2013 , payments stopped . Data from that quarter shows that early elective inductions dropped by more than 45 percent since 2011 . ( Since reasons for C-sections are harder to collect and interpret , the state doesnt have good data for the programs effects on early elective C-sections . ) NICU admissions were down . The state saved $ 6 million that quarter  25 percent of it from cheaper deliveries and 75 percent from fewer NICU admissions .South Carolina is the only state to halt reimbursements from Medicaid and private insurers . Its important to have the all-payer approach ,  said Main . Medicaid doesnt pay very much for births . Doctors are much more sensitive to what commercial plans pay. The state is now a national model . Weve talked to 20 different states who have called us and asked how we did it ,  said Giese .The federal government is also starting to reform payments for early elective deliveries  through Medicare . It might seem odd that Medicare has anything to say about this issue . ( How many 65-year-olds have babies ? ) But Medicare does pay for some births , to disabled women . More to the point , its the big stick , accounting for 35 to 55 percent of hospitals revenue . Medicare is now linking 1.25 percent of its reimbursement to how well hospitals score on a basket of safety measures . Now that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services requires hospitals to report early elective deliveries , that measure is likely to be added to the basket next year .Medicare reimburses hospitals less than commercial payers do , so even 1.25 percent can determine whether a hospital breaks even on Medicare or not . Still , it could be a lot more  the bigger the percentage , the more hospitals will prioritize safety .One argument for raising the percentage is that it has to be big enough to make up for revenue lost due to healthier babies . NICUs are a major profit center for hospitals . Main said some hospitals complained that when they cracked down on early elective deliveries , their NICU revenues dropped . People dont want to complain about that publicly ,  he said . ( Those who do should fire their P.R . advisers ; those who complain even in private need some serious soul-searching . ) They know that at the end of the day . But theyre still trying to take care of their bottom line.* Collaboration . Transparency and payment reform create incentive for change . But they are not a strategy . South Carolina created a strategy through its monthly meetings to share and support best practices . Obamacare is trying to do something similar across the country with two programs . Partnership for Patients funds and supports networks of hospitals to improve safety . These networks get hospitals to agree to standards , provide model policies , training , technical assistance and monitoring . And Strong Start funds hospitals as they test ways to reduce early elective deliveries and spread those practices .What was most important in reducing early elective deliveries ? All these pieces together . Plus strong public advocacy , good tools to help hospitals improve quality , and local leadership . Many improvement efforts dont get such a good response because theyre approached from one dimension or direction ,  said Main . It really comes down to having multiple different strategies at the same time.Note : An earlier version of this article got the name of The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists wrong .

-1	"Back in May , I offered some general comments on the question of communion for divorced and remarried Catholics  which looms over the Synod on the Family scheduled for this autumn in Rome , and may represent one of the defining controversies of Pope Franciss pontificate  and then wrote what was intended to be the first of two posts addressing Cardinal Walter Kaspers high-profile case for admitting the remarried to the sacrament . That post offered theological and sociological reasons to be skeptical of Kaspers broad suggestion , offered in an interview with the editors of Commonweal , that Catholic marriage generally is in a crisis more severe even than divorce statistics would suggest , in which ( he argued ) possibly as many as half of all Catholic marriages are actually invalid . The second post , which I promised and then didnt deliver , was supposed to be a detailed response to his specific proposal on communion , which he first presented in remarks to his fellow cardinals in the winter and then elaborated again in the Commonweal interview this spring .Now Im going to try to finally deliver that response  but in a slightly different form than I originally envisioned , because theres a new critical assessment of Kaspers argument , written by a group of American Dominicans , that covers the theological and historical issues in much greater detail and with a far deeper grounding in the relevant material than anything Im likely to write here . Readers interested in the the subject  whether as Catholics or Christians or simply because they want to understand why the adoption of Kaspers proposal could lead to an internal crisis in the life of the planets largest religious body  should really turn to that assessment first . Readers interested in my own , more non-expert thoughts , meanwhile , can forge ahead . ( And readers who think Im returning to this subject on this particular week because I cant come up with a clear opinion on the latest Obamacare debate should turn to my spokesman , Francis Urquhart , for a definitive response . )Here , then , is Kaspers original explanation of how communion for divorced and remarried Catholics , in the absence of an annulment declaring their previous marriage invalid , might be made available , and why:The question that confronts us is this : Is this path beyond rigorism and laxity , the path of conversion , which issues forth in the sacrament of mercythe sacrament of penancealso the path that we can follow in this matter ? Certainly not in every case . But if a divorced and remarried person is truly sorry that he or she failed in the first marriage , if the commitments from the first marriage are clarified and a return is definitively out of the question , if he or she can not undo the commitments that were assumed in the second civil marriage without new guilt , if he or she strives to the best of his or her abilities to live out the second civil marriage on the basis of faith and to raise their children in the faith , if he or she longs for the sacraments as a source of strength in his or her situation , do we then have to refuse or can we refuse him or her the sacrament of penance and communion , after a period of reorientation ?The path in question would not be a general solution . It is not a broad path for the great masses , but a narrow path for the indeed smaller segment of divorced and remarried individuals who are honestly interested in the sacraments . Is it not necessary precisely here to prevent something worse ? For when children in the families of the divorced and remarried never see their parents go to the sacraments , then they too normally will not find their way to confession and communion . Do we then accept as a consequence that we will also lose the next generation and perhaps the generation after that ? Does not our well-preserved praxis then become counterproductive ?In this passage and elsewhere , Kasper casts his proposal as above all a practical measure  a middle way between rigorism and laxism ,  a means of saving future generations for the church , a response to a reality that certain levels of spiritual and moral heroism are simply not for the average Christian ,  and a proposal that would be strictly limited to a very small segment of the divorced and remarried . The theological issues at stake , the potential conflict with the churchs traditional teaching , are consistently downplayed and/or brushed aside ; the implication is always that we are talking about an exception that in no way threatens the official , gospel-grounded rule .So lets talk about the practicalities of that exception for a moment . Its important to note that what Kasper is proposing differs from a scenario in which individual pastors might decide on their own initiative to give communion to the remarried , or where remarried Catholics who are morally convinced that their first marriages were invalid , but who havent managed to obtain an annulment , might decide to find a parish where they can act on that conviction and receive the eucharist . Both those possibilities already exist , insofar as the church is huge , diverse , complicated and neither a police state nor ( as Kasper says ) a community of perfectly heroic saints : The formal teaching barring the remarried from communion coexists , inevitably , with individual choices that contravene the rule , and in the Western world especially many Catholics looking for straightforward laxity can very easily find what they are seeking .What Kasper is recommending is something different : Not a certain degree of tolerance for deviations from the rule , but formal permission to abandon it  granted by an official body of the church , with a papal imprimatur , and eventually with , presumably , a formal structure ( say X prayers , wait X weeks , etc . ) that individuals and pastors could follow and adopt .So the first question to ask is why , once this new structure is in place , we should realistically expect it to be limited to a smaller segment of divorced and remarried individuals ,  rather than being extended to the great masses fairly quickly ?Consider that right now the church already has a procedure , the annulment process , that is effectively limited to people who have a stronger-than-average interest in receiving the sacraments after divorcing and marrying again . Suppose that you institute , alongside this procedure , a second path to reception of communion , which involves no paperwork , no tribunals , no difficult family issues or ex-spouse interactions , no long wait with an uncertain outcome at the end . The first , almost-inevitable consequence , it seems to me , would be that many , many people who might otherwise have done so would simply stop applying for annulments and follow this path instead . Yes , under Kaspers proposals , second marriages still wouldnt be blessed by the church , so there would be some Catholics seeking the validation of their second union who would go down the annulment path  but there would be a lot more ( based on my own sense of what I might do in that position , frankly ) who would say , well , maybe someday , but for now its too much , too hard  and take the Kasper door instead .So annulment applications would largely collapse , and most people currently seeking them would simply turn to their local pastor for relief instead . Then at the same time , you would have a far larger population  as large , potentially , as the pool of divorced-and-remarried Catholics who currently show up at Christmas , Easter , and rarely in between  who would never really contemplate going through the annulment process as it currently exists , but who would see the new rubric as an alternative much better suited to their lives and situations . ( Indeed , I would have assumed that the appeal to this great mass of semi-lapsed Catholics would represent a feature rather than a bug for advocates of Kaspers proposal  a way to bring the lapsed and drifting home , to make it easier , as the cardinal suggests , to raise their children Catholic , to boost mass attendance and sacramental participation overall , and so on . )Now in theory pastors could throw up obstacles to requests from this larger group , could work every case extremely carefully , and could substantially limit the number of people going down this path . ( You may receive , a priest might say , but you seem insufficiently contrite about your first marriages failure and/or insufficiently sincere in your practice of faith , and so you may not  ) But this places an awfully heavy burden on an already-burdened clergy , and its much more likely that the pattern with most post-1960s changes to traditional Catholic practice ( from , say , the allowance for taking communion in the hand to the permission for cremation at Catholic funerals ) would play itself out once again : A rhetoric of modesty and pastoral discretion and careful implementation , followed by a swift normalization ( or near-universalization ) of the new rule or approach . Not in every parish or diocese , no doubt , but in enough of them to establish a new pattern , a widespread and generally-accepted norm .So by design , then , rather than by accident , Kaspers approach would almost certainly create a situation in which almost all divorced Catholics could reasonably expect to be able to remarry and resume the reception of the eucharist with the formal blessing of the church . This would , as Kasper says , probably strengthen some Catholics attachment to the church and the sacraments , and give some Catholic children of remarried parents a stronger connection to the life of the faith than they have today . But it would also have other effects as well . Those children of the divorced and remarried that Kasper references would , indeed , be more likely to see their parents going to communion , but they would also be more likely to think that their church did not , in the end , regard marriage as actually as indissoluble , or the words of Jesus on the subject as actually as binding , as Roman Catholicism has heretofore believed and taught . And so would other Catholic married couples , and their children , and others , both within the church and without . ( Especially since its very clear how such a change would be portrayed in media accounts , where the language of exceptional cases and narrow segments would be regarded  again , I think , correctly  as far less significant than the change itself . )Right now , at least in the United States , there is still a Catholic difference on divorce : Overall , Catholic divorce rates are lower than the rates for the secular and for other religious groups ; among couples who marry young , divorce rates among practicing Catholics are substantially lower than rates for other churchgoing Christians ; and then among self-identified Catholics , sacramental marriages are much less likely to dissolve than non-sacramental , civil marriages . Would this difference survive the transformation in church practice that would likely follow the adoption of Kaspers proposal , and the change in church teaching strongly implied ( with , again , its implications amplified in the secular culture ) by that proposals practical effects ? Maybe : Social and religious trends are , yes , quite complicated and difficult to perfectly predict . But the record of similar changes in other Christian churches is not exactly encouraging on this count , and the contagious pattern of family breakdown likewise offers a reason to be sharply pessimistic .So again sticking to practicalities rather than dogmatics , its worth asking a rather sharp question : what kind of increase in the Catholic divorce rate would advocates of Kaspers proposal consider an acceptable cost to set against the benefit of bringing some remarried Catholics and their children back into the church ?*Then there are the questions that follow from the underlying moral logic of the proposal , which would seem , in my reading at least , to have broader applications than Kaspers modest language allows .The argument , as offered , is that the church should hesitate before asking remarried Catholics who have made serious commitments to their new spouses and possibly to children to put those commitments at risk by trying to live chastely , and incur the guilt of obligations unmet and promises unfulfilled . Again , setting aside certain theological issues , one can concede this arguments potency while wondering about its limiting principle . Why , for instance , would the obligations of a second marriage need to be accommodated by the church , and not the obligations of a polygamous marriage  where similar promises are made , and children are just as ( if not more ) likely to be involved ?Polygamy is not of course a major issue in Kaspers Germany or in the United States ( though cases certainly exist ) , but it is very much a major issue in Africa , the churchs more important mission field , and a continent where the definition of marriage is hotly contested , not between Christianity and liberalism , but between Christianity and Islam . Is there anything in Kaspers proposal that would not imply the necessity  or at least the plausibility  of a similar accommodation for spouses in a vowed polygamous union ? Indeed , surely women in polygamous marriages in traditional cultures are in a much more difficult position than men or women in a second marriage in the West  their legal rights more limited , their economic freedom more circumscribed , their ability to break away without losing contact with their children much more constrained . If the church does not ask heroism of remarried Catholics in rich countries , how can it possibly take a strong line against polygamy in contexts where , for someone already tied to such a union , trying to be faithful to the churchs teaching on marriage can exact a far , far higher cost ?This is not a slippery-slope argument ; its just a straightforward application of the principle being invoked . The slippery-slope argument would encompass still other unions : For instance , if the church can not reasonably call the divorced-and-remarried to continence , by what legitimate grounds can it call same-sex-attracted Catholics to that state  especially gay Catholics in same-sex unions who might be rearing children together , like the remarried couples Kasper invokes ? If the church , in his words , can find a way to formally tolerate what is in itself  unacceptable in the case of a mode of living specifically condemned by Jesus himself , why cant it similarly tolerate a mode of life that doesnt involve adultery or the breaking of an existing marriage ?And then there is the further example that the cardinal himself seems to raise , in the following Commonweal exchange:CWL : So , just to be clear , when you talk about a divorced and remarried Catholic not being able to fulfill the rigorists requirements without incurring a new guilt , what would he or she be guilty of ?Kasper : The breakup of the second family . If there are children you can not do it . If youre engaged to a new partner , youve given your word , and so its not possible .Now perhaps ( I would say probably ) there is an English-as-second-language issue here , and Kasper meant engaged as in already civilly married , and not engaged as in merely affianced . But the latter example still raises an interesting point : In a society filled with cohabitation and de facto step-parenting and all the rest , many people make promises and incur obligations to their partners and children long before they enter into a civil marriage , and the guilt that Kasper wants to avoid imposing could be felt in many different situations . You can imagine a scenario , under his logic , where a pastor might feel obliged  because there are promises involved , or kids , or other obligations  to hesitate before insisting that a divorced , not-yet-remarried Catholic live chastely , or before urging him to break off his engagement rather than following through on his intention to marry again . And then of course beyond that the scenario of simple nonmarital cohabitation rears its head : If you have a child with a man , say , and he doesnt want a Catholic wedding , or to marry at all , but is content to live with you and be a father to your children , under Kaspers logic isnt it better for the kids to have their dad around and to see you taking communion ? If what Jesus calls adultery can be tolerable for the church , can not some nonmarital pairings claim the same sort of mercy ? But only a small segment ,  of course *Now I know that for many readers , teasing out these implications makes Kaspers proposal seem that much more reasonable and admirable , because in their view the Catholic Church desperately needs a way to evolve toward the norms of sexual modernity ( on same-sex marriage , especially , but other fronts as well ) . And if this is the entering wedge for that kind of change , well , then so much the better .Thats a perfectly understandable perspective ( about which I hope to say more , in a slightly different form , soon ) . All Im arguing here is that it needs to be forthrightly acknowledged , rather than hidden away as a kind of footnote to what is officially presented as a small pastoral change . That right or wrong , good or evil , merciful or destructive , the Kasper proposal is not a minor tweak to Catholic discipline : Its a depth charge , a change pregnant with further changes , an alteration that could have far more sweeping consequences than innovations ( married priests ; female cardinals ) that might seem more radical on their face .For reasons of theology , sociology , and simple logic , admitting the remarried to communion has the potential to transform not only Catholic teaching and Catholic life , but the churchs very self-understanding . These are the real stakes in this controversy ; these are the terms , here and in Rome , on which it needs to be debated ."
